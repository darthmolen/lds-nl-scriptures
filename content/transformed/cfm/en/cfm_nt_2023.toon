  intro,Conversion Is Our Goal,"","2 Corinthians 5:17,John 16:13,John 14:26","“Conversion Is Our Goal,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: New Testament 2023\n(2022)\n“Conversion Is Our Goal,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nConversion Is Our Goal\nCome, Follow Me: Vision\nThe aim of all gospel learning and teaching is to deepen our conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and help us become more like Them. For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond a classroom into our hearts and homes. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. Gospel learning that leads to true conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."
  using,"UsingCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families","","","## Who Is This Resource For?\nThis resource is for every individual and family in the Church. It is designed to help you learn the gospel—whether on your own or with your family. If you haven’t studied the gospel regularly in the past, this resource can help you get started. If you already have a good habit of gospel study, this resource can help you have more meaningful experiences.\n## How Should I Use This Resource?\nUse this resource in any way that is helpful to you. You may find it helpful as a guide or aid for personal and family scripture study. You could also use it for home evening. The outlines highlight important principles found in the New Testament, suggest study ideas and activities for individuals and families, and provide places to record your impressions.\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families is not meant to replace or compete with other good things you are doing to learn the gospel. Follow the Spirit’s guidance to determine how to approach your own study of the word of God.\n## How Does This Resource Relate to What Happens at Church?\nThe outlines in this resource are organized according to a weekly reading schedule. The Come, Follow Me resources for Primary , for Sunday School , and for Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes follow the same schedule. To support your efforts to learn and live the gospel at home, your teachers at church will give you opportunities to share your experiences, thoughts, and questions about the scripture passages that you have been studying at home.\nBecause Sunday School is taught only twice a month, Sunday School teachers may choose to skip or combine outlines to keep up with the weekly schedule. This may also be necessary (for both Sunday School and Primary) on weeks when regular Church meetings are not held because of stake conference or other reasons. During these weeks you are invited to continue to study the New Testament at home.\n## Do I Need to Follow the Schedule?\nThe schedule will help you read the New Testament by the end of the year. In addition, following the same schedule as others can lead to meaningful experiences at home, at church, and elsewhere. But don’t feel bound by the schedule or compelled to read every verse; the schedule is simply a guide to help you pace yourself. The important thing is that you are learning the gospel individually and as a family."
  personal,Ideas to Improve Your Personal Scripture Study,"","2 Nephi 11:4,Moses 6:63,Topical Guide,Bible Dictionary,Guide to the Scriptures,Doctrine and Covenants 121:29","## Look for Truths about Jesus Christ\nThe scriptures teach us that all things testify of Christ (see 2 Nephi 11:4 ; Moses 6:63 ), so consider noting or marking verses that teach about the Savior and how to follow Him.\n## Look for Inspiring Words and Phrases\nYou may find that certain words and phrases in the scriptures impress you, as if they were written specifically for you. They may feel personally relevant and inspire and motivate you. Consider marking them in your scriptures or writing them in a study journal.\n## Look for Gospel Truths\nSometimes gospel truths (often called doctrine or principles) are stated directly, and sometimes they are implied through an example or story. Ask yourself, “What eternal truths are taught in these verses?”\n## Listen to the Spirit\nPay attention to your thoughts and feelings, even if they are unrelated to what you are reading. Those impressions may be the very things that your Heavenly Father wants you to learn.\n## Liken the Scriptures to Your Life\nConsider how the stories and teachings you are reading apply to your life. For example, you could ask yourself, “What experiences have I had that are similar to what I am reading?” or “How can I follow the example of this person in the scriptures?”\n## Ask Questions as You Study\nAs you study the scriptures, questions may come to mind. These questions might relate to what you are reading or to your life in general. Ponder these questions and look for answers as you continue studying the scriptures.\n## Use Scripture Study Helps\nTo gain additional insights into the verses you read, use the footnotes, the Topical Guide , the Bible Dictionary , the Guide to the Scriptures ( scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ), and other study helps.\n## Consider the Context of the Scriptures\nYou can find meaningful insights about a scripture if you consider its context—the circumstances or setting of the scripture. For example, knowing the background and beliefs of the people a prophet spoke to can help you understand the intent of his words.\n## Record Your Thoughts and Feelings\nThere are various ways to record the impressions that come as you study. For example, you could mark a meaningful word or phrase and record your thoughts as a note in your scriptures. You could also keep a journal of the insights, feelings, and impressions you receive.\n## Study the Words of Latter-day Prophets and Apostles\nRead what latter-day prophets and apostles have taught about the principles you find in the scriptures (for example, see conference.ChurchofJesusChrist.org and Church magazines ).\n## Share Insights\nDiscussing insights from your personal study is not only a good way to teach others, but it also helps strengthen your understanding of what you have read.\n## Live by What You Learn\nScripture study should not only inspire us but also lead us to change the way we live. Listen to what the Spirit prompts you to do as you read, and then commit to act on those promptings.\nElder David A. Bednar said: “We should not expect the Church as an organization to teach or tell us everything we need to know and do to become devoted disciples and endure valiantly to the end [see Doctrine and Covenants 121:29 ]. Rather, our personal responsibility is to learn what we should learn, to live as we know we should live, and to become who the Master would have us become. And our homes are the ultimate setting for learning, living, and becoming” (“ Prepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 102)."

Spend time discussing one another’s drawings.\n## Act Out a Story\nAfter reading a story, invite family members to act it out. Afterward, talk about how the story relates to the things that you are experiencing individually and as a family.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson said: “I promise that as you diligently work to remodel your home into a center of gospel learning, over time your Sabbath days will truly be a delight. Your children will be excited to learn and to live the Savior’s teachings, and the influence of the adversary in your life and in your home will decrease. Changes in your family will be dramatic and sustaining” (“ Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 113)."

Use the\ntopics index\nat the back of the\nChildren’s Songbook\nto find songs that relate to the gospel principles you are teaching. Help your children relate the messages of the songs to their lives. (See also “\nIncluding Sacred Music in Your Gospel Learning\n” in this resource.)\nListen to or act out a story.\nYoung children love stories—from the scriptures, from your life, from Church history or your family history, and from\nChurch magazines\n. Look for ways to involve them in storytelling. They can hold pictures or objects, draw pictures of what they are hearing, act out the story, or even help tell the story. Help your children recognize the gospel truths in the stories you share.\nRead a scripture.\nYoung children may not be able to read very much, but you can still engage them in learning from the scriptures. You may need to focus on a single verse, key phrase, or word. The children may even be able to memorize short phrases from the scriptures if they repeat them a few times. As they hear the word of God, they will feel the Spirit.\nLook at a picture or watch a video.\nWhen you show your children a picture or video related to a gospel principle or scripture story, ask them questions that help them learn from what they are seeing. For example, you could ask, “What is happening in this picture or video? How does it make you feel?” The Gospel Media app,\nGospelMedia.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, and\nchildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nare good places to look for pictures and videos.\nCreate.\nChildren can build, draw, or color something related to the story or principle they are learning.\nParticipate in object lessons.\nA simple object lesson can help your children understand a gospel principle that is difficult to comprehend. When using object lessons, find ways to let your children participate. They will learn more from an interactive experience than from just watching a demonstration.\nRole-play.\nWhen children role-play a situation they are likely to encounter in real life, they are better able to understand how a gospel principle applies to their lives.\nRepeat activities.\nYoung children may need to hear concepts multiple times to understand them. Don’t be afraid to repeat stories or activities often. For example, you might share a scripture story several times in different ways—by reading from the scriptures, summarizing in your own words, showing a video, letting your children help you tell the story, inviting them to act out the story, and so on."

This was His invitation to a rich young man who was striving to keep the commandments (see Matthew 19:16–22 ; Luke 18:18–23 ). What the young man learned—and what we all must learn—is that being a disciple means giving our whole souls to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. We progress in our discipleship as we identify what we lack, make changes, and seek to more fully follow Them.\nLearning from the Savior starts when we strive to understand what He taught.

To help your family prepare to learn from the New Testament this year, you could read the parable of the sower. Your family might enjoy going outside and looking for the different types of ground described in the parable. How can we make our hearts like the “good ground” Jesus described? ( Matthew 13:8 ).\nGalatians 5:22–23 ; Philippians 4:8 . President Russell M. Nelson has invited you to “transform [your] home into a sanctuary of faith” and to “remodel your home into a center of gospel learning.” To those who do these things, he promised: “ Your children will be excited to learn and to live the Savior’s teachings, and the influence of the adversary in your life and in your home will decrease. Changes in your family will be dramatic and sustaining” (“ Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 113).\nThe beginning of the new year is a good time to hold a family council about making your home “a sanctuary of faith” and “a center of gospel learning.” What ideas about how to do this come to mind as we read Galatians 5:22–23 and Philippians 4:8 ? Maybe your family could set personal and family goals to study the New Testament this coming year. What can we do to remind ourselves of our goals?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested song: “ Teach Me to Walk in the Light ,” Children’s Songbook , 177.\nImproving Personal Study\nLook for doctrine. A doctrine is an eternal, unchanging truth. President Boyd K. Packer declared that “true doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior” (“ Little Children ,” Ensign , Nov. 1986, 17). As you and your family study the scriptures, look for truths that can help you to live more like the Savior."

From His Father He obtained power over death” (“ Constancy amid Change ,” Ensign , Nov. 1993, 34).\n## God’s blessings come in His own time.\nLuke 1:5–25, 57–80\nIf you find yourself having to wait for a blessing or if it seems that God isn’t hearing your prayers, the story of Elisabeth and Zacharias can be a reminder that He hasn’t forgotten you. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland promised: “While we work and wait together for the answers to some of our prayers, I offer you my apostolic promise that they are heard and they are answered, though perhaps not at the time or in the way we wanted. But they are always answered at the time and in the way an omniscient and eternally compassionate parent should answer them” (“ Waiting on the Lord ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 115–16). How did Zacharias and Elisabeth remain faithful? (see Luke 1:5–25, 57–80 ). Do you find yourself waiting for a blessing? What do you feel the Lord expects of you while you wait?\nAfter faithfully waiting, Elisabeth and Zacharias were blessed with a son.\n## The faithful willingly submit to God’s will.\nMatthew 1:18–25 ; Luke 1:26–38\nLike Mary, we sometimes find that God’s plans for our life are quite different from what we had planned.

(see Luke 1 ).\nSee also Luke 22:42 ; Bible Dictionary, “ Gabriel .”\n## Mary testified of Jesus Christ’s mission.\nLuke 1:46–55\nMary’s words in Luke 1:46–55 foretold aspects of the Savior’s mission. What do you learn about Jesus Christ from Mary’s statements? You might compare these verses with Hannah’s words in 1 Samuel 2:1–10 and with Jesus’s Beatitudes in Matthew 5:3–12 . What does the Spirit teach you as you ponder these verses?\n## Ideas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMatthew 1:1–17 .

How does God invite us to “fear not”?\nLuke 1:37 . To help your family build faith that “with God nothing shall be impossible,” you could search Luke 1 together and find things God did that might be considered impossible. What other stories can we share—from the scriptures or our own lives—in which God did seemingly impossible things? Searching through the Gospel Art Book could provide ideas.\nLuke 1:46–55 . What are some of the “great things” the Savior has done for us? What could it mean for our souls to “magnify the Lord”?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested song: “ He Sent His Son ,” Children’s Songbook , 34–35.\nImproving Our Teaching\nApply the scriptures to your life.

Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost described as a “baptism of fire”? ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:41 ; see also Bible Dictionary, “ Baptism ,” “ Holy Ghost ”).\nMatthew 3:17 ; Mark 1:11 ; Luke 3:22 .

As you study these chapters, ask the Lord what He wants you to learn.\nOne principle you might find is the need to prioritize the things of God over the things of the world. Which of the Savior’s teachings in Matthew 6–7 help you focus on heavenly things? What other thoughts or impressions do you have? What are you inspired to do? Consider recording your impressions. For example:\nMatthew 6:1–4\nI want to care more about what God thinks of me than what others think.\nAnother principle in Matthew 6–7 is prayer. Take a moment to evaluate your prayers. How do you feel you are doing in your efforts to draw closer to God through prayer? What teachings in Matthew 6–7 inspire you to improve how you pray? Record the impressions you receive. For example:\nMatthew 6:9\nWhen I pray, I want to treat Heavenly Father’s name with reverence.\nMatthew 6:10\nWhen I pray, I can express my desire that the Lord’s will be done.\nYou might consider reading the Sermon on the Mount again, looking for other recurring principles or messages that are especially applicable to you. Record what you find in a study journal, along with your thoughts and impressions.\nWe can draw closer to God through prayer.\nMatthew 6:7\nPeople often understand “vain repetitions” to mean repeating the same words over and over again. However, the word vain can describe something that has no value. Using “vain repetitions” in prayer can mean praying without sincere, heartfelt feeling (see Alma 31:12–23 ).\nMatthew 7:1–5\nIn Matthew 7:1 , the Savior may seem to be saying we should never judge, but in other scriptures (including other verses in this chapter), He gives us instructions about how to judge. If that seems puzzling, the Joseph Smith Translation of this verse might help: “Judge not unrighteously , that ye be not judged; but judge righteous judgment ” (in Matthew 7:1, footnote a ). What do you find in Matthew 7:1–5 , along with the rest of the chapter, that helps you know how to “judge righteous judgment”?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “ Judging Others ,” topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; Lynn G.

How has living the Savior’s teachings created a solid foundation for you? What do you feel inspired to do to continue building your “house upon a rock”? (see verse 24 ).\nSee also Helaman 5:12 .\n## Living the Savior’s teachings can help me become like Him.\nMatthew 6–7\nThe Sermon on the Mount contains many gospel principles. As you study these chapters, ask the Lord what He wants you to learn.\nOne principle you might find is the need to prioritize the things of God over the things of the world. Which of the Savior’s teachings in Matthew 6–7 help you focus on heavenly things? What other thoughts or impressions do you have? What are you inspired to do? Consider recording your impressions. For example:\nMatthew 6:1–4\nI want to care more about what God thinks of me than what others think.\nAnother principle in Matthew 6–7 is prayer. Take a moment to evaluate your prayers. How do you feel you are doing in your efforts to draw closer to God through prayer? What teachings in Matthew 6–7 inspire you to improve how you pray? Record the impressions you receive. For example:\nMatthew 6:9\nWhen I pray, I want to treat Heavenly Father’s name with reverence.\nMatthew 6:10\nWhen I pray, I can express my desire that the Lord’s will be done.\nYou might consider reading the Sermon on the Mount again, looking for other recurring principles or messages that are especially applicable to you. Record what you find in a study journal, along with your thoughts and impressions.\nWe can draw closer to God through prayer.\n## What does it mean to use “vain repetitions” in prayer?\nMatthew 6:7\nPeople often understand “vain repetitions” to mean repeating the same words over and over again. However, the word vain can describe something that has no value. Using “vain repetitions” in prayer can mean praying without sincere, heartfelt feeling (see Alma 31:12–23 ).\n## I can judge righteously.\nMatthew 7:1–5\nIn Matthew 7:1 , the Savior may seem to be saying we should never judge, but in other scriptures (including other verses in this chapter), He gives us instructions about how to judge. If that seems puzzling, the Joseph Smith Translation of this verse might help: “Judge not unrighteously , that ye be not judged; but judge righteous judgment ” (in Matthew 7:1, footnote a ). What do you find in Matthew 7:1–5 , along with the rest of the chapter, that helps you know how to “judge righteous judgment”?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “ Judging Others ,” topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; Lynn G.

(see verse 24 ).\nSee also Helaman 5:12 .\n## Ideas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMatthew 6–7 . One way to learn from Matthew 6–7 as a family is to watch the videos “Sermon on the Mount: The Lord’s Prayer” and “Sermon on the Mount: Treasures in Heaven” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). Family members could follow along in their scriptures and pause the videos whenever they hear something they want to discuss. This activity could span several days, if needed.\nSermon on the Mount: The Lord's Prayer\nSermon on the Mount: Treasures in Heaven\nMatthew 6:5–13 . What can we learn about prayer from the way the Savior prayed? How can we use His prayer as a model to improve our personal and family prayers? (See also Luke 11:1–13 .) If you have younger children, you might practice praying together.\nMatthew 6:33 . What does it mean to “seek … first the kingdom of God”? How are we doing this individually and as a family?\nMatthew 7:1–5 . To visualize the teachings in these verses, your family could find a mote (a tiny wood fragment) and a beam (a large piece of wood). What does comparing the two teach us about judging others? If you’d like to explore this topic further, you could use some of the resources in “ Judging Others ” (Gospel Topics, topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ).\nMatthew 7:24–27 . To help your family better understand the Savior’s parable of the wise man and the foolish man, you could let them pour water on sand and then on a rock. How can we build our spiritual foundations on a rock?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested song: “ The Wise Man and the Foolish Man ,” Children’s Songbook , 281.\nImproving Personal Study\nShare insights.

As you read about Jesus healing a man on the Sabbath, your family could talk about how we are “restored whole” by the Savior. How can the Sabbath be a day of healing for us?\nInspired by the Savior’s example in these verses, your family could make a list of ways you can “do well on the sabbath” ( verse 12 ). Be sure to include opportunities to serve others. It could be helpful to keep your list and refer to it on future Sundays.\nLuke 11:33–36 . Ponder how you might teach your family what it means to be “full of light” ( verses 34, 36 ). Would an object lesson help? You could also discuss ways to bring the Savior’s light into our lives, our home, and the world. For ideas, see the video “The Light That Shineth in Darkness,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nThe Light That Shineth in Darkness\nLuke 11:37–44 . Perhaps your family could discuss these verses while washing dishes together. You could talk about why it would be a bad idea to wash only the outsides of things like bowls and cups. You could then relate this to the need to be righteous not just in our outward deeds but also in our inward thoughts and feelings.\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested hymn: “ How Gentle God’s Commands ,” Hymns , no. 125."

Prophets with faith in Jesus Christ have moved literal mountains (see Jacob 4:6 ; Moses 7:13 ). But usually, that isn’t the miracle we need. President M. Russell Ballard taught: “If we have faith as small as a mustard seed, the Lord can help us remove the mountains of discouragement and doubt in the tasks ahead of us as we serve with God’s children, including family members, Church members, and those who are not yet members of the Church” (“ Precious Gifts from God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 10).

What additional blessings did the thankful leper receive because he gave thanks?\nYou might also ponder the Savior’s words, “Thy faith hath made thee whole” ( verse 19 ). In your opinion, how are gratitude and faith related? How do both help us become whole? The video “President Russell M. Nelson on the Healing Power of Gratitude” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) can help you ponder these questions.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson on the Healing Power of Gratitude\nSee also Dale G.

Do your family members understand what it feels like to lose something—or to be lost? Talking about their experiences could start a discussion about the parables of the lost sheep and lost coin. Or you could play a game in which someone hides and other family members try to find him or her. How does this activity help us understand these parables?\nLuke 15:11–32 . How can we be like the father in this story when we have loved ones who are lost? What can we learn from the older son’s experience that can help us be more Christlike? In what ways is the father in this parable like our Heavenly Father?\nLuke 17:11–19 . To help family members apply the account of the ten lepers, you could invite them to leave secret notes of gratitude for each other. You could also sing together “ Count Your Blessings ” ( Hymns , no. 241) and count the blessings your family has received.\nJohn 11:1–46 .

Consider singing a hymn, as Jesus and His Apostles did—perhaps a sacrament hymn. How might singing a hymn have been a blessing to Jesus and His Apostles at that time? How are hymns a blessing to us?\nJohn 13:1–17 . You may want to show your family the picture at the end of this outline as you read these verses. What truths did the Savior teach by His actions? What details in the picture help us understand these truths? Perhaps family members could share how living by these truths has brought them happiness (see John 13:17 ).\nJohn 13:34–35 . After reading these verses, you might talk together about how other people know that you are disciples of Jesus Christ. How does the Savior want His followers to be known? You could ask family members to talk about people whose love for others shows that they are true disciples of Jesus Christ. You might also discuss ways you could show more love as a family.\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested song: “ Love One Another ,” Children’s Songbook , 136.\nImproving Personal Study\nPonder.

But this mocking could not change the truth: Jesus is the Son of God. As you read about the humiliation Jesus endured, think about the opposition and mocking His work faces today. What insights do you gain about enduring opposition?

Reading about this might lead you to think about times when you’ve felt distant from God. You might ponder how the Savior’s sacrifice on the cross makes it possible for you to overcome that distance. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland testified, “Because Jesus walked such a long, lonely path utterly alone, we do not have to do so. … Trumpeted from the summit of Calvary is the truth that we will never be left alone nor unaided, even if sometimes we may feel that we are” (“ None Were with Him ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2009, 88).

(see the insight provided by the Joseph Smith Translation in footnote c ). Referring to the Savior’s words, President Henry B. Eyring taught: “We must forgive and bear no malice toward those who offend us. The Savior set the example from the cross. … We do not know the hearts of those who offend us” (“ That We May Be One ,” Ensign , May 1998, 68).

The Apostle Paul wrote most of the epistles in the New Testament—starting with Romans and ending with Hebrews. His epistles are organized by length, except for Hebrews (see Bible Dictionary, “ Pauline Epistles ”). Although Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, it was actually written near the end of Paul’s missionary journeys.\nRomans 1–6\nThe following definitions may help you better understand the Epistle to the Romans:\nThe law. When Paul wrote of “the law,” he was referring to the law of Moses. The word “works” in Paul’s writings referred to outward actions associated with the law of Moses. Consider how the law of Moses and the works required under it are different from “the law of faith” described in Romans 3:23–31 .\nCircumcision, uncircumcision. Anciently, circumcision was a token or symbol of the covenant God made with Abraham. Paul used the term “circumcision” to refer to Jews (the covenant people) and “uncircumcision” to refer to Gentiles. Ponder what Romans 2:25–29 teaches about what it really means to be God’s covenant people. Note that circumcision is no longer a token of God’s covenant with His people (see Acts 15:23–29 ).\nJustification, justify, justified. These terms refer to the remission, or pardoning, of sin. When we are justified, we are forgiven, declared guiltless, and freed from eternal punishment for our sins. When you see these terms, notice what Paul taught about what makes justification possible (see also Guide to the Scriptures, “ Justification, Justify ,” scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; D. Todd Christofferson, “ Justification and Sanctification ,” Ensign , June 2001, 18–25). In Romans, words like “righteous” and “righteousness” can be seen as synonyms for words like “just” and “justification.”\nGrace. Grace is “divine … help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.” Through grace, all people will be resurrected and receive immortality. In addition, “grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts.” We do not earn grace through our efforts; rather, it is grace that gives us “strength and assistance to do good works that [we] otherwise would not be able to maintain” (Bible Dictionary, “ Grace ”; see also 2 Nephi 25:23 ; Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “ The Gift of Grace ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2015, 107–10; Brad Wilcox, “ His Grace Is Sufficient ,” Ensign , Sept. 2013, 35–37; or Liahona , Sept. 2013, 43–45). As you read Romans, record what you learn about the Savior’s grace.\nRomans 2:17–29\nSome of the Jewish Christians in Rome apparently still believed that the rites and rituals of the law of Moses brought salvation. This may seem like a problem that doesn’t apply anymore since we don’t live by the law of Moses. But as you read Paul’s writings, especially Romans 2:17–29 , think about your own efforts to live the gospel. Are your outward performances, such as taking the sacrament or attending the temple, deepening your conversion and strengthening your faith in Christ? (see Alma 25:15–16 ). Is there something you should change so that your outward actions are leading to a change of heart?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ The Challenge to Become ,” Ensign , Nov. 2000, 32–34.\nRomans 3:10–31 ; 5\nSome people may feel discouraged at Paul’s bold declaration that “there is none righteous, no, not one” ( Romans 3:10 ). But there are also hopeful messages in Romans. Look for them in chapters 3 and 5 , and consider why remembering that “all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” ( Romans 3:23 ) is an important step toward learning to “rejoice in hope” through Jesus Christ ( Romans 5:2 ).\nRomans 6\nPaul taught that the gospel of Jesus Christ should change the way we live. What statements in Romans 6 describe how following the Savior has helped you “walk in newness of life”? ( verse 4 ).\n## What are the Epistles, and how are they organized?\nThe Epistles are letters written by Church leaders to Saints in various parts of the world. The Apostle Paul wrote most of the epistles in the New Testament—starting with Romans and ending with Hebrews.

When we are justified, we are forgiven, declared guiltless, and freed from eternal punishment for our sins. When you see these terms, notice what Paul taught about what makes justification possible (see also Guide to the Scriptures, “ Justification, Justify ,” scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; D. Todd Christofferson, “ Justification and Sanctification ,” Ensign , June 2001, 18–25). In Romans, words like “righteous” and “righteousness” can be seen as synonyms for words like “just” and “justification.”\nGrace. Grace is “divine … help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.” Through grace, all people will be resurrected and receive immortality. In addition, “grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts.” We do not earn grace through our efforts; rather, it is grace that gives us “strength and assistance to do good works that [we] otherwise would not be able to maintain” (Bible Dictionary, “ Grace ”; see also 2 Nephi 25:23 ; Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “ The Gift of Grace ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2015, 107–10; Brad Wilcox, “ His Grace Is Sufficient ,” Ensign , Sept. 2013, 35–37; or Liahona , Sept. 2013, 43–45). As you read Romans, record what you learn about the Savior’s grace.\n## My actions should reflect and increase my conversion.\nRomans 2:17–29\nSome of the Jewish Christians in Rome apparently still believed that the rites and rituals of the law of Moses brought salvation. This may seem like a problem that doesn’t apply anymore since we don’t live by the law of Moses. But as you read Paul’s writings, especially Romans 2:17–29 , think about your own efforts to live the gospel. Are your outward performances, such as taking the sacrament or attending the temple, deepening your conversion and strengthening your faith in Christ? (see Alma 25:15–16 ). Is there something you should change so that your outward actions are leading to a change of heart?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ The Challenge to Become ,” Ensign , Nov. 2000, 32–34.\n## Through Jesus Christ, I can be forgiven of my sins.\nRomans 3:10–31 ; 5\nSome people may feel discouraged at Paul’s bold declaration that “there is none righteous, no, not one” ( Romans 3:10 ). But there are also hopeful messages in Romans. Look for them in chapters 3 and 5 , and consider why remembering that “all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” ( Romans 3:23 ) is an important step toward learning to “rejoice in hope” through Jesus Christ ( Romans 5:2 ).\n## Jesus Christ invites me to “walk in newness of life.”\nRomans 6\nPaul taught that the gospel of Jesus Christ should change the way we live. What statements in Romans 6 describe how following the Savior has helped you “walk in newness of life”? ( verse 4 ).\n## Ideas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nRomans 1:16–17 . How can we show that we are “not ashamed of the gospel of Christ”?\nRomans 3:23–28 . As you read these verses, you might discuss the difference between “earning” God’s grace, which we can never do, and receiving it, which we must do. When have we felt God’s grace? How can we receive it more completely?\nRomans 5:3–5 . What tribulations have we experienced? How have these tribulations helped us to develop patience, experience, and hope?\nRomans 6:3–6 . What did Paul say in these verses about the symbolism of baptism? Perhaps your family could plan to attend an upcoming baptism. Or someone in your family could share pictures or memories from his or her baptism. How does making and keeping our baptismal covenants help us “walk in newness of life”?\nBaptism symbolizes beginning a new life as a disciple of Christ.\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested song: “ When I Am Baptized ,” Children’s Songbook , 103.\nImproving Personal Study\nAsk questions as you study. As you study the scriptures, questions may come to mind. Ponder these questions and look for answers. For example, in Romans 1–6 you could look for answers to the question “What is grace?”"

We learn from verse 29 that ancient Christians participated in baptisms for the dead, just as we do today. How would we explain to others why we are baptized for our ancestors? (see “What Are Baptisms for the Dead?” [video], ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). What are we doing as a family to provide temple ordinances for our deceased ancestors who need them? You can find more resources on this topic in the Gospel Topics article “ Baptisms for the Dead ” ( topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) and at FamilySearch.org .\nWhat Are Baptisms for the Dead?\n1 Corinthians 15:35–54 . What objects or pictures could you show to help your family understand some of the terms Paul used to describe how mortal bodies are different from resurrected bodies? For instance, to demonstrate the difference between corruptible and incorruptible (see verses 52–54 ) you could show metal that has rusted and metal that doesn’t rust. Or you could contrast something weak with something powerful (see verse 43 ).\n1 Corinthians 15:55–57 . A discussion about these verses can be especially meaningful if your family knows someone who has passed away. Family members could bear testimony of how Jesus Christ takes away “the sting of death” ( verse 56 ).\n1 Corinthians 16:13 . To help your family members relate to this verse, you could draw a circle on the ground and instruct a family member to “stand fast” inside it with his or her eyes closed. Then others could try to push or pull him or her from the circle. What difference does it make when the person in the circle has his or her eyes open and can “watch”? What can we do to “stand strong” when we are tempted to make bad choices?

Perhaps each family member could write a letter or “epistle” explaining how another family member has been a good example of a disciple of Jesus Christ.

One of these teachings was that in order to be saved, Gentiles who had accepted the gospel needed to be circumcised and to keep other traditions of the law of Moses (see Galatians 2 ). Paul called these traditions the “yoke of bondage” ( Galatians 5:1 ). As you read Paul’s counsel to the Galatians, look for principles that can help you understand what true freedom is. You could also ponder what false traditions or other yokes of bondage might exist in your life. Is there anything that is preventing you from experiencing the freedom that the gospel offers?

Paul called these traditions the “yoke of bondage” ( Galatians 5:1 ). As you read Paul’s counsel to the Galatians, look for principles that can help you understand what true freedom is. You could also ponder what false traditions or other yokes of bondage might exist in your life. Is there anything that is preventing you from experiencing the freedom that the gospel offers? How have Christ and His gospel “made [you] free”? ( Galatians 5:1 ).\nSee also 2 Nephi 2:27 ; 9:10–12 .\n## I am an heir to the blessings promised to Abraham.\nGalatians 3\nSome of the Galatian Saints were concerned that because they were not literal descendants (“seed”) of Abraham, they would not receive the blessings promised to Abraham, including exaltation. According to Galatians 3:7–9, 13–14, 27–29 , what qualifies a person to be the “seed of Abraham”?\nTo learn about the blessings promised to Abraham and the blessings that we can inherit as his seed, see Gospel Topics, “ Abrahamic Covenant ” ( topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). Why are the blessings promised to Abraham important to you?\n## Abraham had the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nGalatians 3:6–25\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith explained: “We cannot believe that the ancients in all ages were so ignorant of the system of heaven as many suppose, since all that were ever saved, were saved through the power of this great plan of redemption, as much so before the coming of Christ as since. … Abraham offered sacrifice, and notwithstanding this, had the Gospel preached to him” (“ The Elders of the Church in Kirtland to Their Brethren Abroad ,” The Evening and the Morning Star , Mar. 1834, 143, JosephSmithPapers.org ). Why do you think it was important for the Saints in Paul’s time to know that Abraham and other ancient prophets had the gospel of Jesus Christ? Why is it important to you to know this? (See Helaman 8:13–20 ; Moses 5:58–59 ; 6:50–66 .)\nSee also Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith (2007), 45–56 .\n## If I “walk in the Spirit,” I will receive the “fruit of the Spirit.”\nGalatians 5:13–26 ; 6:7–10\nStudying these verses can help you evaluate how fully you are walking in the Spirit. Are you experiencing the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in verses 22–23 ? What other fruit, or results, of spiritual living have you noticed? Ponder what you need to do to cultivate this fruit more fully. How might cultivating this fruit improve the important relationships in your life?\nI must seek the “fruit of the Spirit” in my life.\nIf you are trying to walk in the Spirit but your efforts don’t seem to be bearing the promised fruit, read Galatians 6:7–10 .

What does it mean to “live by faith”? How are we living by faith as a family?\nGalatians 4:1–7 . You might introduce Galatians 4 by discussing the differences between a king’s servants and his children. What opportunities or potential does a king’s child have that a servant does not? Think about this as you read together verses 1–7 . What do these verses teach about our relationship with Heavenly Father?\nGalatians 5:16–26 . Consider discussing the difference between the “works of the flesh” and the “fruit of the Spirit.” To add some fun to your discussion, your family could label different fruits with words Paul used to describe the fruit of the Spirit. Then each family member could select one, define it, and talk about someone who exemplifies that fruit. This could lead to a discussion about ways your family could invite the Spirit into your home and cultivate this fruit. After the discussion, you could enjoy a fruit salad together.\nGalatians 6:1–2 . There may be times when someone in your family is “overtaken in a fault.” What counsel do you find in Galatians 6:1–2 about what to do in such a situation?\nGalatians 6:7–10 . If your family has ever planted something together, you could use that experience to illustrate the principle “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” ( verse 7 ). Or you could ask family members about their favorite fruits or vegetables and talk about what it takes to grow a plant that produces that food. (See the picture at the end of this outline.) You could talk about the blessings your family hopes to receive and how to “reap” those blessings.\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested song: “ Teach Me to Walk in the Light ,” Children’s Songbook , 177.\nImproving Our Teaching\nHelp your family liken the scriptures to themselves. Nephi said, “I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning” ( 1 Nephi 19:23 ). To help your family do this, you could invite them to ponder times when they have experienced the fruit of the Spirit described in Galatians 5:22–23 . (See Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 21 .)"

You could deepen your understanding of the Great Apostasy—and your appreciation for the Restoration—by pondering some of the following:\nScriptures that foretold the Apostasy: Isaiah 24:5 ; Amos 8:11–12 ; Matthew 24:4–14 ; 2 Timothy 4:3–4\nScriptures that show the Apostasy was already beginning in Paul’s time: Acts 20:28–30 ; Galatians 1:6–7 ; 1 Timothy 1:5–7\nObservations about the Great Apostasy by Christian reformers:\nMartin Luther: “I have sought nothing beyond reforming the Church in conformity with the Holy Scriptures. … I simply say that Christianity has ceased to exist among those who should have preserved it” (in E. G. Schweibert, Luther and His Times: The Reformation from a New Perspective [1950], 590).\nRoger Williams: “The apostasy … hath so far corrupted all that there can be no recovery out of that apostasy till Christ send forth new apostles to plant churches anew” (in Philip Schaff, The Creeds of Christendom [1877], 851).\nSee also 2 Nephi 28 ; Gospel Topics, “ Apostasy ,” topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\n## Ideas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\n1 Thessalonians 3:9–13 .

After reading James 1:5 , your family could summarize the account of the First Vision (see Joseph Smith—History 1:8–20 ) or watch the video “Ask of God: Joseph Smith’s First Vision” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). Invite family members to share their testimonies of the Prophet Joseph Smith and experiences when Heavenly Father answered their prayers.\nAsk of God: Joseph Smith's First Vision\nJames 1:26–27 . Consider watching the video “True Christianity” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). Then read James’s definition of “pure religion” in James 1:26–27 , and discuss ways your family can make your practice of religion more pure.\nTrue Christianity\nJames 3 . James 3 includes many images that could inspire memorable object lessons to help your family remember to speak kindly. For example, you could build a fire together and talk about how a small, unkind word can cause a big problem (see verses 5–6 ). Or you could serve something sour in something that is usually used for sweet food—such as lemon juice in a honey jar. This could lead to a discussion about using sweet and uplifting words (see verses 9–14 ).\nJames 4:5–8 . Why should we “draw nigh to God” ( James 4:8 ) when we face temptation?\nJames 5:14–16 . President Dallin H. Oaks taught that “parents should encourage more priesthood blessings in the family” (“ The Powers of the Priesthood ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 67). Perhaps reading James 5:14–16 and sharing experiences about receiving a priesthood blessing could encourage family members to ask for a blessing when they are sick or need spiritual strength.\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see this week’s outline in Come, Follow Me—For Primary .\nSuggested hymn: “ Have I Done Any Good? ,” Hymns , no. 223.\nImproving Personal Study\nAct on what you learn.

Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenants by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nHere are some resources that can help you: 2 Nephi 31 ; Gospel Topics, “ Baptism ,” topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child. Help him or her understand that faith is something that can grow stronger and stronger throughout life. What are some things your child can do to develop stronger faith in Christ before he or she is baptized?\nWhen your child makes a wrong choice, speak joyfully about the gift of repentance. And when you make a wrong choice, share the joy that comes when you repent. Testify that because Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, He gave us power to change. When your child seeks forgiveness, forgive freely and joyfully.\nTell your child about your baptism. Show pictures and share memories. Talk about how you felt, how your baptismal covenants have helped you come to know Jesus Christ better, and how they continue to bless your life. Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like the following: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something he or she promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (see Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 ).\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell him or her about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have. Invite your child to share how he or she feels. Note the variety of ways the Spirit can speak to people, including ways He speaks to you personally. Help your child recognize moments when he or she may be experiencing the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nWatch together a few of the videos in the Gospel Library collection titled “ Hear Him! ” Talk together about the different ways the Lord’s servants hear His voice. Invite your child to draw a picture or make a video about how he or she hears the Savior’s voice.\nTalk about how becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has blessed you. How have you come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you have served others and as others have served you? Help your child think of ways to serve and strengthen others as a member of the Church.\nMake the sacrament a sacred and joyful event in your family. Help your child plan ways to focus on Jesus Christ during the sacrament. How will we show that the sacrament is sacred to us?\nThe Friend magazine often includes articles, stories, and activities to help children prepare for baptism and confirmation. Let your child choose some to read and enjoy with you. (See also the collection “ Preparing for Baptism ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library.)\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” ( 2 Nephi 31:17 ).\n## Teaching Your Children about the Priesthood\nThe priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All Church members who keep their covenants are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families (see General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 3.5 , ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see General Handbook , 2.2 ).\nWe receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. When men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. All of Heavenly Father’s children—His sons and His daughters—will be blessed as they come to better understand the priesthood.\nTo learn more about the priesthood, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Spiritual Treasures ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79; Russell M. Nelson, “ The Price of Priesthood Power ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 66–69; “ Priesthood Principles ,” chapter 3 in General Handbook .\nMake priesthood ordinances a consistent part of your family life. For example, help your child prepare spiritually for the sacrament each week. Encourage your child to seek priesthood blessings when he or she is sick or needs comfort or direction. Make it a habit to point out ways the Lord is blessing your family through priesthood power.\nAs you read the scriptures together, watch for opportunities to discuss how God blesses people through His power. Share your own experiences of when God has blessed you through His priesthood. For examples of blessings we receive from God through the priesthood, see General Handbook , 3.2 , 3.5 .\nLearn the priesthood line of authority of someone in your family. (Melchizedek Priesthood holders can receive a copy of their line of authority by sending an email to LineofAuthority@ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; see also “ Request a Priesthood Line of Authority ” in the Help Center on ChurchofJesusChrist.org .) Talk about why it’s important to know that priesthood authority comes from Jesus Christ Himself. Why does He share it with us?\nTeach your child that after baptism, he or she can receive priesthood power by keeping the baptismal covenant. Review together President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ Spiritual Treasures ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79). Tell your child how priesthood ordinances have brought God’s power into your life. For a list of some of the ways we are blessed by priesthood power, see General Handbook , 3.5 .\nDiscuss the question “What is a servant of the Lord like?” Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:36–42 , and look for answers. Whenever you notice your child (or someone else) applying one of the principles or attributes in these verses, point it out.\nWhen you or your child uses keys to unlock a door or start a car, take a moment to compare those keys to the keys that priesthood leaders hold. (For a definition of priesthood keys, see General Handbook , 3.4.1 ). What do priesthood keys “unlock” or “start” for us? See also Gary E. Stevenson, “ Where Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood? ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 29–32; “ Where Are the Keys? ” (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nWhere Are the Keys?\nWhen you are set apart for a calling, invite your child to be present, if possible. Let your child see you fulfilling your calling. You might even look for appropriate ways he or she can help you. Describe how you feel the Lord’s power in your calling.\n## Going to the Temple—Baptisms and Confirmations for the Dead\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including those who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year he or she turns 12, your child is old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors.\nTo learn more about baptisms and confirmations for the dead, see “ About Proxy Baptism and Confirmation ,” temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nAttend the temple as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the temple recommend questions together. Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together Malachi 4:6 . Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on FamilySearch.org . Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “ Temple ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “ Preparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org .)\n## Receiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel from Heavenly Father to us and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching him or her the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Gospel Topics, “ Patriarchal Blessings ,” topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nShare with your child your experience of receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how you use the blessing in your life. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nTake time to review together some of the resources in Gospel Topics, “ Patriarchal Blessings .” To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see General Handbook , 18.17 .\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to ChurchofJesusChrist.org , click the account icon at the top right corner of the screen, and select “Patriarchal Blessing.”\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and to share them with your child.\n## Going to the Temple—the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” ( Doctrine and Covenants 95:8 ). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nTo learn more about the temple endowment, see “ About the Temple Endowment ,” temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; Russell M. Nelson, “ Prepare for the Blessings of the Temple ,” Ensign , Oct. 2010, 41–51.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the temple. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there.\nExplore together temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Read together articles like “ About the Temple Endowment ” and “ Prepare for the House of the Lord .” Let your child ask any questions he or she has about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “ Prepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “ Home-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation ”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how he or she is keeping the baptismal covenant described in Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 . Also help your child notice how the Lord is blessing him or her. Build your child’s confidence in his or her ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ. You could use General Handbook , 27.2 , to review the covenants we make in the temple.\n## Serving a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to become a missionary long before you go on a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“ Becoming a Missionary ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2005, 45–46). The experiences your child has becoming a missionary will bless him or her eternally, not just for the period of time he or she may serve as a missionary.\nTo learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Preaching the Gospel of Peace ,” Liahona , May 2022, 6–7; M. Russell Ballard, “ Missionary Service Blessed My Life Forever ,” Liahona , May 2022, 8–10; Missionary Preparation: Adjusting to Missionary Life , ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nModel how to share the gospel in natural ways. Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive as a member of His Church. Invite others to join your family in Church- and family-related activities.\nLook for opportunities for your family to interact with missionaries. Invite them to teach your friends, or offer to let them teach people in your home. Ask the missionaries about the experiences they’re having and how missionary service is helping them draw closer to Jesus Christ. Also ask what they did (or wish they had done) to prepare to be missionaries.\nIf you served a mission, talk openly and often about your experiences. Or invite friends or family members who served missions to talk about theirs. You could also talk about ways you’ve shared the gospel with others throughout your life. Help your child think of ways he or she can share the gospel.\nGive your child opportunities to teach your family principles of the gospel. Your child could also practice sharing his or her beliefs with others. For example, you could discuss questions like “How would we introduce the Book of Mormon to someone who has never heard of it?” or “How would we describe the need for the Savior to someone who is not a Christian?”\nHelp your child become comfortable talking to people. What are some good ways to start a conversation? Encourage your child to learn how to listen to what others say, understand what is in their hearts, and share truths of the gospel that could bless their lives.\nLook for opportunities for your child to learn about other cultures and faiths. Help him or her recognize and respect the good and true principles in others’ beliefs.\n## Going to the Temple—Sealing\nIn the temple, a husband and wife can be married for eternity. This occurs in an ordinance called sealing. Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your son or daughter, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help him or her prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nTo learn more, see Gospel Topics, “ Sealing ,” topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nRead together “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org . What does this proclamation teach about happiness in family life and about successful marriages? With your child, choose one of the principles listed in the proclamation to study. You could look up scriptures related to that principle in the Guide to the Scriptures . You could also set goals to apply that principle more fully in your family. As you work on your goals, discuss together the effect that living that principle has on family life.\nWith your child, read President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “ In Praise of Those Who Save ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 77–80). When you get to the section titled “ A Society of Disposables ,” you might look for things in your home that are disposable and other things that are not. Talk about how you treat things differently when you want them to last a long time. What does this suggest about how we should treat marriage and family relationships? What else do we learn from President Uchtdorf’s message about how the Savior can help us build strong marriages and families?\nIf you are married, be open with your child about the things you feel you’re doing well as a couple, the things you’re learning, and the ways you’re trying to improve. If you and your spouse have been sealed in the temple, show your child by example how you strive to keep your covenants with each other and with the Lord. Tell your child how you strive to make Heavenly Father and the Savior the center of your relationship and how They are helping you.\nWhen family decisions need to be made, hold family councils and discussions. Make sure that all family members’ opinions are heard and valued. Use these discussions as an opportunity to model healthy communication and kindness in family relationships, even when not everyone sees things the same way.\nWhen there is disagreement or conflict in the family, demonstrate patience and compassion. Help your child see how handling conflict in Christlike ways can help him or her prepare for a happy marriage. Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–42 , and talk about how the principles in these verses can be applied to marriage."
