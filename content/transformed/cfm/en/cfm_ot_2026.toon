  "001-conversion",Conversion Is Our Goal,"","2 Corinthians 5:17,John 16:13,John 14:26","“Conversion Is Our Goal,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\nConversion Is Our Goal\nThe aim of all gospel learning and teaching is to deepen our conversion and help us become more like Jesus Christ. For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond the classroom into an individual’s heart and home. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. True conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers in us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."
  "002-using","UsingCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church","","Moroni 6:4,Isaiah 53","## Who Is This Resource For?\nCome, Follow Me is for anyone who wants to learn from the scriptures—individually, as a family, and in Church classes. If you haven’t studied the scriptures regularly in the past, this resource can help you get started. If you already have a good habit of scripture study, this resource can help you have more meaningful experiences.\n## Individuals and Families at Home\nThe ideal place to learn the gospel is the home. Your teachers at church can support you, and you can get encouragement from other ward members. But to survive spiritually, you and your family need daily nourishment from “the good word of God” ( Moroni 6:4 ; see also Russell M. Nelson, “ Opening Remarks ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 6–8).\nUse this resource in any way that is helpful to you. The outlines highlight some eternal truths found in the Old Testament. They also suggest ideas and activities to help you study the scriptures individually, with your family, or with friends. As you study, follow the Spirit’s guidance to find eternal truths that are meaningful to you. Look for God’s messages for you, and follow the promptings you receive.\n## Teachers and Learners at Church\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church is the curriculum for Sunday classes in Primary, youth and adult Sunday School, Young Women classes, and Aaronic Priesthood quorum meetings. If you teach in any of these settings, you are encouraged to use the outlines in this resource for your personal study and as you prepare to teach. Start by having your own experiences in the scriptures. Your most important preparation will occur as you search the scriptures and seek the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Look for eternal truths that help you become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Come, Follow Me can help you identify some of these truths and understand the context of the scriptures.\nKeep in mind that learning the gospel, at its best, is home centered and Church supported. In other words, your main responsibility is to support the people you teach in their efforts to learn and live the gospel at home. Don’t worry about having unique content to provide for them in class. Instead, give them opportunities to share their experiences, thoughts, and questions about the scripture passages they’ve read at home. Invite them to share the eternal truths they have found. This is more important than covering a certain amount of material.\n## Youth and Adult Sunday School Classes\nOne main reason we gather in Sunday School classes is to support and encourage one another as we strive to follow Jesus Christ. A simple way to do this is to ask a question like “What has the Holy Ghost taught you this week as you studied the scriptures?” Answers to this question could lead to meaningful discussions that build faith in Jesus Christ and His gospel.\nThen you could invite discussion based on the study suggestions in Come, Follow Me . For instance, a study idea might suggest searching Isaiah 53 , looking for words that describe the Savior’s mission. You might ask class members to share any thoughts or feelings that these words inspired for them. Or you could spend some time looking for these words as a class.\n## Aaronic Priesthood Quorums and Young Women Classes\nWhen Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes meet on Sundays, their purpose is somewhat different from a Sunday School class. In addition to helping each other learn the gospel of Jesus Christ, these groups also meet to counsel together about accomplishing the work of salvation and exaltation (see General Handbook , 1.2 ). They do this with the direction of class and quorum presidencies.\nFor this reason, each quorum or class meeting should begin with a member of the quorum or class presidency leading a discussion about efforts to, for example, live the gospel, minister to people in need, share the gospel, or participate in temple and family history work.\nAfter this time for counseling together, an instructor leads the class or quorum in learning the gospel together. Adult leaders or members of the class or quorum can be assigned to teach. The class or quorum presidency, consulting with adult leaders, makes these assignments.\nPeople assigned to teach should prepare by using the learning suggestions in the weekly outline of Come, Follow Me . In each outline, this icon indicates an activity that is especially relevant to youth. However, any of the suggestions in the outline could be used as a learning activity for youth.\nFor a sample agenda for quorum and class meetings, see appendix D.\n## Primary\nYour preparation to teach Primary begins as you study the scriptures personally and with your family. As you do, be open to spiritual impressions and insights from the Holy Ghost about the children in your Primary class. Be prayerful, and the Spirit can inspire you with ideas to help them learn the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nAs you prepare to teach, you might gain additional inspiration by exploring the teaching ideas in Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church . Each outline in this resource has a section titled “Ideas for Teaching Children.” Think of these ideas as suggestions to spark your inspiration. You know the children in your Primary class—and you will get to know them even better as you interact with them in class. God knows them too, and He will inspire you with the best ways to teach and bless them.\nIt’s possible that children in your class will have already done some of the activities in Come, Follow Me with their families. That’s OK. Repetition is good. Consider inviting the children to share with each other what they learned at home—though you should also plan ways for children to participate even if they aren’t learning at home. Children learn gospel truths more effectively when these truths are taught repeatedly through a variety of activities. If you find that a learning activity is effective for the children, consider repeating it, especially if you are teaching younger children. You might also review an activity from a previous lesson.\nIn months that have five Sundays, Primary teachers are encouraged to replace the scheduled Come, Follow Me outline on the fifth Sunday with one or more of the learning activities in “Appendix B: For Primary—Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path.”"
  "003-improve-learning",Ideas to Improve Learning at Home and at Church,"","2 Nephi 11:4,Moses 6:63,Topical Guide,Bible Dictionary,Guide to the Scriptures","## Pray for inspiration\nThe scriptures are the word of God, so ask Him for help to understand them.\n## Look for truths about Jesus Christ\nAll things testify of Christ (see 2 Nephi 11:4 ; Moses 6:63 ), so consider noting or marking verses that testify of the Savior, deepen your love for Him, and teach how to follow Him. Sometimes truths about the Savior and His gospel are stated directly, and sometimes they are implied through an example or story. Ask yourself, “What eternal truths are taught in these verses? What do these truths teach me about the Savior?”\n## Listen to the Spirit\nPay attention to your thoughts and feelings, even if they are unrelated to what you are reading. These impressions may be what your Heavenly Father wants you to learn.\n## Record your impressions\nThere are many ways to record the impressions that come as you study. For example, you may find that certain words and phrases in the scriptures impress you; you could mark them and record your thoughts as a note in your scriptures. You could also keep a journal of the insights, feelings, and impressions you receive.\n## Share what you’re learning with others\nDiscussing insights from your personal study is a good way to teach others, and it also helps strengthen your understanding of what you have read. Share what you’re learning with family members and friends (in person or digitally), and invite them to do the same.\n## Relate the scriptures to your life\nConsider how the stories and teachings you are reading apply to your life. For example, you could ask yourself, “What experiences have I had that are similar to what I am reading?”\n## Ask questions as you study\nAs you study the scriptures, questions may come to mind. These questions might relate to what you are reading or to your life in general. Ponder these questions and look for answers as you continue studying the scriptures.\n## Use scripture study helps\nTo gain additional insights into the verses you read, use the footnotes, the Topical Guide , the Bible Dictionary , the Guide to the Scriptures , and other study helps.\n## Consider the context of the scriptures\nYou can find meaningful insights about a scripture passage as you consider its context, including the circumstances or setting it came from. For example, knowing the background and beliefs of the people God spoke to can help you better understand the intent of His words.\n## Study the words of latter-day prophets and apostles\nRead what latter-day prophets and apostles have taught about the principles you find in the scriptures.\n## Live by what you learn\nScripture study should not only inspire us but also lead us to change the way we live. Listen to what the Spirit prompts you to do as you read, and then act on these promptings.\n## Use music\nSuggested hymns and children’s songs are found throughout Come, Follow Me . Use sacred music to invite the Spirit and to deepen your faith and testimony of gospel truths.\n## Memorize scriptures\nSelect a scripture passage that is meaningful to you, your family, or your class, and memorize it by repeating it daily or by playing a memorization game.\n## Share object lessons\nFind objects that relate to the chapters and verses that you are reading. Consider how each object relates to the teachings in the scriptures.\n## Draw, find, or take a picture\nRead a few verses, and then draw something that relates to what you read. Or you could look for a picture in the Gospel Art Book or elsewhere in Gospel Library. You could also take a picture that illustrates what you learned.\n## Dramatize a story\nAfter reading a story, invite family or class members to act it out. Afterward, talk about how the story relates to the things that you are experiencing.\n## Be flexible at home\nIf you have family members who aren’t willing to participate in family scripture study, look for other ways to connect with them. For example, could you share eternal truth naturally in your conversations or share a meaningful scripture in a way that doesn’t seem preachy or overbearing? Scripture study doesn’t have to look the same in every family. Some children may respond better to studying the scriptures one on one. Be prayerful and follow the promptings of the Spirit.\nTeacher council meetings for parents. If you would like additional help in your efforts to teach your children, find out if your ward is holding teacher council meetings for parents (see General Handbook , 17.5 ). These meetings are an opportunity for parents to counsel and learn together about how to improve their teaching. They can discuss the principles in Teaching in the Savior’s Way , the ideas on these pages for improving family scripture study, and the learning and teaching suggestions found throughout Come, Follow Me ."

So to find answers in the Old Testament, look for Him. It won’t always be easy. You may need to ponder patiently and seek spiritual guidance. Sometimes the references to Him seem very direct, as in Isaiah’s declaration, “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: … and his name shall be called … The Prince of Peace” ( Isaiah 9:6 ). In other places, the Savior is represented more subtly, through symbols and similarities—for example, through the descriptions of animal sacrifices or the account of Joseph forgiving his brothers and saving them from famine.\nLight of the World , by Scott Sumner\nIf you seek greater faith in the Savior as you study the Old Testament, you will find it. Perhaps this could be the goal of your study this year. Pray that the Spirit will guide you to find and focus on passages, stories, and prophecies that will bring you closer to Jesus Christ.\n## Divinely Preserved\nDon’t expect the Old Testament to present a thorough and precise history of humankind. That’s not what the original authors and compilers were trying to create. Their larger concern was to teach something about God—about His plan for His children, about what it means to be His covenant people, and about how to find redemption when we fall short. Sometimes they did it by relating historical events as they understood them, including stories from the lives of great prophets. Genesis is an example of this, and so are books like Joshua, Judges, and 1 and 2 Kings. But other Old Testament writers did not aim to be historical at all. Instead, they taught through works of art like poetry and literature. The Psalms and the Proverbs fit in this category. And then there are the precious words of prophets, such as Isaiah and Malachi, who spoke the word of God to ancient Israel—and, through the miracle of the Bible, still speak to us today.\nDid all of these prophets, poets, and compilers know that their words would be read by people all over the world thousands of years later? We don’t know. But we marvel that this is exactly what has happened. Nations rose and fell, cities were conquered, kings lived and died, but the Old Testament outlasted them all, from generation to generation, from scribe to scribe, from translation to translation. Of course some things were lost or modified, and yet somehow so much was miraculously preserved.\nOld Testament Prophet , by Judith A. Mehr (detail)\nThese are just a few things to keep in mind as you read the Old Testament this year. God preserved these ancient writings because He knows you and what you are going through. He has prepared a spiritual message for you in these words, which will draw you closer to Him and build your faith in His plan and His Beloved Son. Perhaps He will lead you to a passage or an insight that will bless someone you know—a message you can share with a friend, a family member, or a fellow Saint. There are so many possibilities. Isn’t that exciting to think about?\nNephi said, “My soul delighteth in the scriptures” ( 2 Nephi 4:15 ). Maybe you’ll feel the same way as you read many of the same words Nephi read—what we now call the Old Testament.\nBooks in the Old Testament\nIn most Christian versions of the Old Testament, the books are organized differently from how they were arranged when they were first compiled into one collection. So while the Hebrew Bible groups the books into three categories—the law, prophets, and writings—most Christian Bibles arrange the books into four categories: law (Genesis–Deuteronomy), history (Joshua–Esther), poetic books (Job–Song of Solomon), and prophets (Isaiah–Malachi).\nWhy are these categories important? Because knowing what kind of book you are studying can help you understand how to study it.\nHere’s something to keep in mind as you begin reading “the law,” or the first five books of the Old Testament. These books, which are traditionally attributed to Moses, probably passed through the hands of numerous scribes and compilers over time. And we know that, over the centuries, “many parts which are plain and most precious” were taken away from the Bible (see 1 Nephi 13:23–26 ). Still, the books of Moses are the inspired word of God, even though they are—like any work of God transmitted through mortals—subject to human imperfections (see Moses 1:41 ; Articles of Faith 1:8 ). The words of Moroni, referring to the sacred Book of Mormon record that he helped compile, are helpful here: “If there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things of God” ( title page of the Book of Mormon ). In other words, a book of scripture doesn’t need to be free from human error to be the word of God."

You could also show a picture of the temple and share your feelings about the covenants we make there.\nThis week’s activity page could help your children be excited to make and keep covenants with Heavenly Father. You could also sing a song about making covenants, like “ When I Am Baptized ” ( Children’s Songbook , 103).\nDo your children know anyone who goes by different names in different settings? Perhaps a parent or teacher is addressed differently at work, at home, and at church. Talk about those names; then read Exodus 6:3 together and invite your children to find the names Jesus Christ was known by before He was born (see also the Joseph Smith Translation in footnote c ).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## I can learn of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament.\nThe words and culture of the Old Testament may be difficult for children to understand, but you can help them see Jesus Christ in symbols and stories.

Nelson taught, “the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity” (“ Choices for Eternity ” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022], Gospel Library). It follows that Satan would try to confuse you on that same point. Look for this pattern in God’s message to Moses in Moses 1:4, 6 and in Satan’s messages in Moses 1:12 . What do you learn from these verses about the differences between God and Satan?\nPresident Nelson also taught, “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make” (“ Choices for Eternity ”).

But that doesn’t mean we regret their choice. As you read Genesis 3 and Moses 4 , you might ask yourself, why was the Fall important to God’s plan?\nAccording to Moses 5:9–12 , how did Adam and Eve feel about the Fall? How can you apply their words to your experiences in this fallen world? What else do you learn from 2 Nephi 2:19–25 ?\nSee also Mosiah 3:19 ; Alma 12:21–37 ; and Doctrine and Covenants 29:39–43 .\nLeaving Eden , by Annie Henrie Nader\nGenesis 3:1–7 ; Moses 4:22–31 ; 5:4–15\nAdam and Eve’s story is one of hope and redemption through Jesus Christ. To see why, you might start by searching for the results of the Fall in Genesis 3:1–7 ; Moses 4:22–31 and marking or listing what you find. How do these results affect you? Then you could search Moses 5:4–15 , looking for God’s plan to redeem us from these effects. Why were Adam and Eve “glad” after the angel visited them? What do you learn from them about Heavenly Father’s plan?\nSee also “Because of Him” (video), Gospel Library.\nBecause of Him\nGenesis 3:16 ; Moses 4:22\nThis passage of scripture has sometimes been misunderstood to mean that a husband is justified in treating his wife unkindly. In our day, the Lord’s prophets have taught that a husband and wife should see each other as equal partners in fulfilling their divine responsibilities in the family (see “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” [Gospel Library]). Elder Dale G. Renlund and Sister Ruth Lybbert Renlund explained that a righteous husband “will seek to minister; he will acknowledge error and seek forgiveness; he will be quick to offer praise; he will be considerate of family members’ preferences; he will feel the great weight of responsibility to provide ‘the necessities of life and protection’ for his family; he will treat his wife with the utmost respect and deference. … He will bless his family” ( The Melchizedek Priesthood: Understanding the Doctrine, Living the Principles [2018], 23).\nTo learn more about how the Lord views the relationship between husbands and wives, ponder the counsel of Elder Ulisses Soares in the following video. How would you explain, in your own words, what it means for husband wife to be “equal partners”?\nEqual Partnership in Marriage\nMoses 4:1–4\nElder Dale G. Renlund taught, “Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him” (“ Choose You This Day ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 104). Why is it so important in Heavenly Father’s plan that we choose to do what is right?\nAs you read Moses 4:1–4 , look for what Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ did to protect your right to choose—your agency. How can you access their protecting power? For ideas, consider studying the section “ Make inspired choices ” in For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (4–5).\nConsider also reading what Lehi taught about agency in 2 Nephi 2:11–20, 25–30 . Why is opposition necessary for agency? How can you show your appreciation to Jesus Christ for making you “free to choose”? ( 2 Nephi 2:27 ).\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ Opposition in All Things ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 114–17; Topics and Questions, “ Agency ,” Gospel Library; “ Choose the Right ,” Hymns , no. 239.\nIncrease participation. Many learning activities can be done as an individual, family, or class; in small groups; or in pairs. Use a variety of methods to allow people to participate who might not otherwise have a chance. For this activity, you could invite one person or group to read Moses 4 and the For the Strength of Youth guide while another group studies the verses in 2 Nephi 2 . They could then teach each other what they learned in their respective section.\nMoses 4:4–12 ; 5:13–33\nAs you read Moses 4:4–12 ; 5:13–33 , consider listing ways that Satan tried to tempt Adam and Eve and their children. How does he attempt these same things today? How does Heavenly Father help you resist Satan’s deceptions?\nMoses 4:13–16, 27\nAfter partaking of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve tried to cover their own nakedness. Later, the Lord offered to clothe them. As you read Moses 4:13–16, 27 , consider the following:\nPonder what nakedness and clothing can represent in the scriptures (see, for example, Revelation 7:9, 13–15 ; 2 Nephi 9:14 ; Doctrine and Covenants 109:22–26, 76 ). What do you learn from Adam and Eve’s experience with nakedness and clothing?\nIf you have been endowed in the temple, consider what Adam and Eve might say to you about the significance of your temple garment and what it represents.\nSee also “Sacred Temple Clothing” (video), Gospel Library.\nSacred Temple Clothing\nMoses 5:4–9, 16–26\nAs you study Moses 5:4–9, 16–26 , consider the attitudes of Adam and Eve and their sons Cain and Abel toward sacrifice. Why did the Lord accept Abel’s sacrifice but not Cain’s?\nWhat does the Lord ask you to sacrifice? Is there anything in these verses that shapes the way you think about those sacrifices?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\nDid God give Adam and Eve conflicting commandments in the Garden of Eden?\nWas it a sin for Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit?\nWhat do we know about the curse and mark placed upon Cain?\nClick to see more.\n## The Fall was a necessary part of God’s plan.\nGenesis 3 ; Moses 4\nIt’s true that Adam and Eve’s choice led to many of the difficulties we experience in mortality. But that doesn’t mean we regret their choice. As you read Genesis 3 and Moses 4 , you might ask yourself, why was the Fall important to God’s plan?\nAccording to Moses 5:9–12 , how did Adam and Eve feel about the Fall? How can you apply their words to your experiences in this fallen world? What else do you learn from 2 Nephi 2:19–25 ?\nSee also Mosiah 3:19 ; Alma 12:21–37 ; and Doctrine and Covenants 29:39–43 .\nLeaving Eden , by Annie Henrie Nader\n## Jesus Christ offers hope and redemption.\nGenesis 3:1–7 ; Moses 4:22–31 ; 5:4–15\nAdam and Eve’s story is one of hope and redemption through Jesus Christ. To see why, you might start by searching for the results of the Fall in Genesis 3:1–7 ; Moses 4:22–31 and marking or listing what you find. How do these results affect you? Then you could search Moses 5:4–15 , looking for God’s plan to redeem us from these effects. Why were Adam and Eve “glad” after the angel visited them? What do you learn from them about Heavenly Father’s plan?\nSee also “Because of Him” (video), Gospel Library.\nBecause of Him\n## What does it mean that Adam was to “rule over” Eve?\nGenesis 3:16 ; Moses 4:22\nThis passage of scripture has sometimes been misunderstood to mean that a husband is justified in treating his wife unkindly. In our day, the Lord’s prophets have taught that a husband and wife should see each other as equal partners in fulfilling their divine responsibilities in the family (see “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” [Gospel Library]). Elder Dale G. Renlund and Sister Ruth Lybbert Renlund explained that a righteous husband “will seek to minister; he will acknowledge error and seek forgiveness; he will be quick to offer praise; he will be considerate of family members’ preferences; he will feel the great weight of responsibility to provide ‘the necessities of life and protection’ for his family; he will treat his wife with the utmost respect and deference. … He will bless his family” ( The Melchizedek Priesthood: Understanding the Doctrine, Living the Principles [2018], 23).\nTo learn more about how the Lord views the relationship between husbands and wives, ponder the counsel of Elder Ulisses Soares in the following video. How would you explain, in your own words, what it means for husband wife to be “equal partners”?\nEqual Partnership in Marriage\n## I need agency and opposition to grow.\nMoses 4:1–4\nElder Dale G. Renlund taught, “Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children do what is right; it is to have His children choose to do what is right and ultimately become like Him” (“ Choose You This Day ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 104). Why is it so important in Heavenly Father’s plan that we choose to do what is right?\nAs you read Moses 4:1–4 , look for what Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ did to protect your right to choose—your agency. How can you access their protecting power? For ideas, consider studying the section “ Make inspired choices ” in For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (4–5).\nConsider also reading what Lehi taught about agency in 2 Nephi 2:11–20, 25–30 . Why is opposition necessary for agency? How can you show your appreciation to Jesus Christ for making you “free to choose”? ( 2 Nephi 2:27 ).\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ Opposition in All Things ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 114–17; Topics and Questions, “ Agency ,” Gospel Library; “ Choose the Right ,” Hymns , no. 239.\nIncrease participation. Many learning activities can be done as an individual, family, or class; in small groups; or in pairs. Use a variety of methods to allow people to participate who might not otherwise have a chance. For this activity, you could invite one person or group to read Moses 4 and the For the Strength of Youth guide while another group studies the verses in 2 Nephi 2 . They could then teach each other what they learned in their respective section.\n## Satan seeks “to deceive and to blind” me.\nMoses 4:4–12 ; 5:13–33\nAs you read Moses 4:4–12 ; 5:13–33 , consider listing ways that Satan tried to tempt Adam and Eve and their children. How does he attempt these same things today? How does Heavenly Father help you resist Satan’s deceptions?\n## “I, the Lord God … clothed them.”\nMoses 4:13–16, 27\nAfter partaking of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve tried to cover their own nakedness. Later, the Lord offered to clothe them. As you read Moses 4:13–16, 27 , consider the following:\nPonder what nakedness and clothing can represent in the scriptures (see, for example, Revelation 7:9, 13–15 ; 2 Nephi 9:14 ; Doctrine and Covenants 109:22–26, 76 ).

Why did the Lord accept Abel’s sacrifice but not Cain’s?\nWhat does the Lord ask you to sacrifice? Is there anything in these verses that shapes the way you think about those sacrifices?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Scripture Helps\nDid God give Adam and Eve conflicting commandments in the Garden of Eden?\nWas it a sin for Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit?\nWhat do we know about the curse and mark placed upon Cain?\nClick to see more.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 3 ; Moses 4 ; 5:8–15\nTo help your children better understand the Fall of Adam and Eve, you could copy the pictures from “ Adam and Eve ” (in Old Testament Stories , 13–16) and cut them out. Then you could work together to put the pictures in order as you discuss the experiences of Adam and Eve. As you do, talk about why it was important, in Heavenly Father’s plan, for Adam and Eve to leave the Garden of Eden.\nAdam and Eve\nYour children can feel gratitude for the Atonement of Jesus Christ as they understand how He overcomes the effects of the Fall.

Reading Moses 7 can inspire you to continue that effort today.\nYou might start by exploring the questions “What is Zion?” and “How is it different from the rest of the world?” Consider listing answers that come to you as you study Moses 7 , in particular verses 16–21, 27, 53, 62–69 .\nYour answers to these questions might make it clear that we still have a lot of work to do to build Zion. So how do we do it? It might help to think about times when you felt you were “of one heart and one mind” with someone ( Moses 7:18 ). Maybe it was in a ward, family, or group at work or school. What did people do to create righteous unity?\nHere are some other resources that you could explore to find ideas and inspiration. Pick one or more to study, and then write down what you feel inspired to do to build Zion:\nPhilippians 2:1–4 ; 4 Nephi 1:15–18 ; Doctrine and Covenants 97:21 ; 105:5 .\nUlisses Soares, “ Brothers and Sisters in Christ ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 70–73.\nD. Todd Christofferson, “ One in Christ ,” Liahona , May 2023, 77–80.\n“We Come Together and Unite as One” (video), Gospel Library.\nWe Come Together & Unite As One\nGod wants His people to be “of one heart and one mind” ( Moses 7:18 ).\n## Jesus Christ is “the King of Zion.”\nMoses 7:53\nWhat does it mean to you to have Jesus Christ as your King? Note the other titles of Jesus Christ in this verse. What do they teach you about Him? What do you think it means to come “in at the gate and [climb] up by [Him]”?\nSee also “ Come, O Thou King of Kings ,” Hymns , no. 59.\n## God weeps—and rejoices—for His children.\nMoses 7:28–69\nSome people see God as a distant being who isn’t emotionally affected by what happens to us. Enoch gained a different view of God in the vision recorded in Moses 7 . What did he learn about God—and what do you learn—in verses 28–40 ? Why do you think Enoch was surprised to see God weep? Why is it important to you to know that He does?\nAs the vision continued, Enoch wept too. But God also shared with him reasons to rejoice. Look for them in Moses 7:41–69 . What do you learn from Enoch’s vision that can help you “lift up your heart, and be glad,” despite the “bitterness” in your life ( verse 44 )?\nSee also Jeffrey R. Holland, “ The Grandeur of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2003, 70–73.\n## Jesus Christ will come again in the last days.\nMoses 7:59–67\nEnoch’s vision, especially what’s recorded in Moses 7:59–67 , is one of history’s first prophecies of the Savior’s Second Coming. What impresses you about the way these verses describe the last days? For example, consider how you feel the prophecies from verse 62 are being fulfilled. What do these phrases teach you about God’s work in the latter days?\nSee also Henry B.

Then you could ask your children to help you retell the story in their own words. The pictures of Enoch in this outline might help.\nEnoch the Prophet\nHere’s one way to help your children understand what it means to be of “one heart and one mind” ( Moses 7:18 ): Make a paper heart and cut it into pieces, enough for each child to have one. Let them write their name on their piece and work together to put the heart together. As they do, you might talk about things you love about each child.\nHelp your children count how many times the word “Zion” appears in Moses 7:18–21, 62–63, 68–69 . Each time they find the word, help them discover what the verse says about Zion (see also Guide to the Scriptures, “ Zion ,” Gospel Library). How can we be more like the people described in these verses?\nEncourage personal scripture study. Whether you’re teaching your family at home or a class on Sunday, one of the best ways you can help others build lasting faith in Jesus Christ is to help them establish a habit of seeking personal experiences with the scriptures. Share the experiences you’re having with the scriptures, and encourage family or class members to share their experiences. When we hear about how reading the scriptures is blessing others, we are often inspired to seek these same blessings from the Lord. (See Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 25 .)\nMoses 7:32–33\nTo introduce Moses 7:32–33 to your children, you might talk to them about a choice they had to make recently. Then you could read the verses together to find out what Heavenly Father wants us to choose. What choices can we make to show that we choose Him? Perhaps your children could take turns acting out one of these choices while the others guess what the action represents.\nMoses 7:59–67\nIn Moses 7:59 , Enoch asks the Lord a question. Invite your children to find it, and then ask them to find the answer in verse 60 . You might also talk with them about a time when they were expecting someone to return home. Ask them how they felt and what they did to get ready. How can we get ready for Jesus to return?\nConsider showing pictures of times when the Savior appeared to people (such as Gospel Art Book , nos. 60 , 82 , 83 , and 84 ). What are the people doing in the pictures? How might the people have felt when they met Jesus? You could also sing a song about the Savior’s Second Coming, such as “ When He Comes Again ” ( Children’s Songbook , 82–83), and ask the children what they think it will be like when Jesus comes again.

  "07-thoughts",The Covenant,"","Abraham 1:2,Abraham 1:2,Genesis 12:2–3,Abraham 2:9, 11,Abraham 2:12,Matthew 5:5,Psalm 37:9, 11,Abraham 2:11,Doctrine and Covenants 22:1,132:6","## What Is the Abrahamic Covenant?\nAbraham wanted “to be a greater follower of righteousness” ( Abraham 1:2 ), so God invited him into a covenant relationship. Abraham wasn’t the first to have this desire, and he wasn’t the first to receive a covenant. It was, after all, an everlasting covenant. Abraham sought for “the blessings of the fathers” ( Abraham 1:2 )—blessings that were offered by covenant to Adam and Eve and thereafter to people who sought these blessings diligently.\nGod’s covenant with Abraham promised wonderful blessings: an inheritance of land, a large posterity, access to priesthood ordinances, and a name that would be honored for generations to come. But the focus of this covenant was not just on the blessings Abraham and his family would receive but also on the blessing they would be to the rest of God’s children. “Thou shalt be a blessing,” God declared, “and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed” ( Genesis 12:2–3 ).\nDid this covenant give Abraham, Sarah, and their descendants a privileged status among God’s children? Only in the sense that it is a privilege to bless others. The family of Abraham were to “bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations,” sharing “the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal” ( Abraham 2:9, 11 ). Being God’s covenant people didn’t mean they were better than others; it meant they had a duty to help others be better.\nThis covenant was the blessing Abraham was longing for. After receiving it, Abraham said in his heart, “Thy servant has sought thee earnestly; now I have found thee” ( Abraham 2:12 ).\nThat was thousands of years ago, but this covenant has been restored in our day. And it is currently being fulfilled in the lives of God’s people. The fulfillment of the covenant is building momentum in the latter days as God’s work progresses, blessing families throughout the world. And anyone who, like Abraham, wants to be a greater follower of righteousness—anyone who seeks the Lord earnestly—can be a part of it.\n## What Does the Abrahamic Covenant Mean to Me?\nYou are a child of the covenant. You make a covenant with God when you are baptized and when you partake of the sacrament. And you receive the fulness of the covenant with the sacred ordinances of the temple.\nThrough these covenants and ordinances, we become God’s people. We are bound to Him “with everlasting ties.” “Once we make a covenant with God,” President Russell M. Nelson has taught, “we leave neutral ground forever. God will not abandon His relationship with those who have forged such a bond with Him. In fact, all those who have made a covenant with God have access to a special kind of love and mercy. … Because of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us.” You will see this in the history of God’s covenant people in the Old Testament, and you will see it in your own life as one of His covenant children.\nBe Not Afraid , by Dan Wilson\nThis is the precious understanding granted to us because of the Restoration of the Abrahamic covenant through the Prophet Joseph Smith. So when you read about covenants in the Old Testament, don’t think just about God’s relationship with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Think also about His relationship with you. When you read about the promise of numberless posterity, don’t think just about the millions who today call Abraham their father. Think also about God’s promise to you of eternal families and eternal increase. When you read about the promise of a land of inheritance, don’t think just about the land promised to Abraham. Think also about the celestial destiny of the earth itself—an inheritance promised to the “meek” who “wait upon the Lord” ( Matthew 5:5 ; Psalm 37:9, 11 ). And when you read about the promise that God’s covenant people will bless “all the families of the earth” ( Abraham 2:11 ), don’t think just about the ministry of Abraham or the prophets who descended from him. Think also about what you can do—as a covenant follower of Jesus Christ—to be a blessing to the families around you."

Andersen taught, “and yet I believe there is a place inside of us that we uniquely and individually control and create. … Eventually, our inner desires are given life and they are seen in our choices and in our actions” (“ Educate Your Desires, Elder Andersen Counsels ,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). Consider how Abraham 1:1–19 demonstrates what Elder Andersen taught. Questions like these might help:\nWhat did Abraham desire? How were his desires evident in his actions? How did God support his desires?\nWhat are your desires? How are they evident in your actions? How does God support you?\nWhat message do these verses have for people whose family members do not desire righteousness?\nOne of Abraham and Sarah’s greatest desires—to have a child—went unfulfilled for many years (see Genesis 15:1–6 ). What do you learn from Hebrews 11:8–13 about how Abraham and Sarah faced this trial? How does the Savior help you “embrace” His promises, even if they are “afar off”?\nSee also “Deliverance of Abraham” (video), Gospel Library.\nDeliverance of Abraham\nGenesis 12:1–3 ; 13:15–16 ; 15:1–6 ; 17:1–8, 15–22 ; Abraham 2:6–11\nWhy is it important for you to know about the covenant God made with Abraham? Because God wants to make a similar covenant with you. He promised that this covenant would continue in Abraham’s posterity, or “seed,” and that “as many as receive this Gospel shall be … accounted thy seed” (see Abraham 2:10–11 ). In other words, the covenant continues in you—when you are baptized and more completely when you make covenants in the temple (see Galatians 3:26–29 ; Doctrine and Covenants 132:30–32 ).\nFor that reason, you might want to study Abraham 2:6–11 and make a list of what, exactly, God promised Abraham and Sarah (see also Genesis 12:1–3 ; 13:15–16 ; 15:1–6 ; 17:1–8, 15–22 ). How might these blessings apply to you?\nSome of these promises have eternal parallels. How are promises like a land of inheritance or a large posterity fulfilled eternally? (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ; 132:20–24, 28–32 ).\nBesides promising blessings, God told Abraham to “ be a blessing” ( Genesis 12:2 ; emphasis added). What do you think that means? How will you be a blessing? (see Abraham 2:11 ).\nTo teach about covenants, Elder Dale G.

Because God wants to make a similar covenant with you. He promised that this covenant would continue in Abraham’s posterity, or “seed,” and that “as many as receive this Gospel shall be … accounted thy seed” (see Abraham 2:10–11 ). In other words, the covenant continues in you—when you are baptized and more completely when you make covenants in the temple (see Galatians 3:26–29 ; Doctrine and Covenants 132:30–32 ).\nFor that reason, you might want to study Abraham 2:6–11 and make a list of what, exactly, God promised Abraham and Sarah (see also Genesis 12:1–3 ; 13:15–16 ; 15:1–6 ; 17:1–8, 15–22 ). How might these blessings apply to you?\nSome of these promises have eternal parallels. How are promises like a land of inheritance or a large posterity fulfilled eternally? (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4 ; 132:20–24, 28–32 ).\nBesides promising blessings, God told Abraham to “ be a blessing” ( Genesis 12:2 ; emphasis added). What do you think that means? How will you be a blessing? (see Abraham 2:11 ).\nTo teach about covenants, Elder Dale G. Renlund spoke of tidal waves in the Amazon River, and President Emily Belle Freeman talked about walking a rocky path with a broken ankle (see “ Accessing God’s Power through Covenants ,” Liahona , May 2023, 35–37; “ Walking in Covenant Relationship with Christ ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 76–79).

That night Jacob’s name was changed to Israel, a name that means, among other things, “he perseveres with God” (\nGenesis 32:28\n, footnote\nb\n).\nNear the Jabbok River, Jacob received the name\nIsrael\n.\nThis is the first time the name\nIsrael\nappears in the Bible, and it’s a name that perseveres throughout the book and throughout history. The name soon came to refer to more than just one man. Israel had 12 sons, and their descendants were collectively known as the “house of Israel,” the “tribes of Israel,” the “children of Israel,” or the “Israelites.”\nThroughout history, the children of Israel attached great significance to their descent from one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Their lineage was an important part of their covenant identity. The Apostle Paul proclaimed that he was “of the tribe of Benjamin” (\nRomans 11:1\n). One reason Lehi sent his sons to Jerusalem to retrieve the plates of brass was that the plates contained “a genealogy of his fathers” (\n1 Nephi 5:14\n). Lehi discovered that he was a descendant of Joseph, and his posterity’s understanding of their connection to the house of Israel proved important to them in the years that followed.\nIn the Church today, you may hear about Israel in expressions like “the gathering of Israel.” We sing about the “Redeemer of Israel,” the “Hope of Israel,” and “Ye Elders of Israel.”\nIn these cases, we aren’t talking or singing about the ancient kingdom of Israel or the modern nation called Israel. Rather, we are referring to people who have been gathered from the nations of the world into the Church of Jesus Christ. We are referring to people who persevere with God, who earnestly seek His blessings, and who, through baptism, have become His covenant people. In the words of President Russell M. Nelson, to be of Israel means “to let God prevail in our lives, … to let God be the most powerful influence in our lives.”\nYour patriarchal blessing declares your connection to one of the tribes of the house of Israel. That’s more than an interesting piece of family history. It also has to do with your present and future. Being a part of the house of Israel means you have a covenant relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. It means that you, like Abraham, are meant to “be a blessing” to God’s children (\nGenesis 12:2\n;\nAbraham 2:9–11\n). It means, in the words of Peter, that “ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light” (\n1 Peter 2:9\n). It means that\nyou\n“let God prevail”—that you are one who “perseveres with God” as you honor your covenants with Him.\nFamily Tree of Jacob (Israel)\n, by Brent Evans\nNotes\nSee also\nGenesis 32:24–32\n. There are other meanings for the name Israel, including “God rules,” “God fights or perseveres,” and “Let God prevail.”\nSee\nAlma 26:36\n;\n3 Nephi 20:25\n.\nHymns\n(1985),\nnos. 6\n,\n259\n,\n319\n.\nRussell M.

As you sing with children, help them discover and understand the principles taught in the songs” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 32 ).\nHelp your children think of temptations they might face. Let them role-play how they could “flee” from these temptations.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

As you listen to general conference this Easter weekend, make note of testimonies of Christ that you hear. What do they teach you about Him?\nEaster is a joyful time, because it’s a time to celebrate the Savior’s Atonement and Resurrection. And yet, even during Easter, there are many people who don’t feel joyful for various reasons. What can you do to spread the Savior’s peace and joy this Easter?\nOne idea is to find messages in the scriptures about the peace and joy Jesus Christ offers, like these: Psalms 16:8–11 ; 30:2–5 ; Isaiah 12 ; 25:8–9 ; 40:28–31 ; John 14:27 ; 16:33 ; Alma 26:11–22 . Consider how you might share these messages with others. For example, maybe you could create Easter cards to share, based on these messages. Be prayerful about who needs to receive your Easter greeting. You might also decide to share your messages on social media, where many people can see them.\nHymns about Christ and the Resurrection, such as “ He Is Risen! ” ( Hymns , no. 199), can also help us feel peace and joy at Easter. Look for phrases in the hymn that, in your opinion, capture the joy of Easter.\nSee also Jeffrey R. Holland, “ Not as the World Giveth ,” Liahona , May 2021, 35–38; Mark S.

You could start by showing them the pictures below and letting them talk about what’s happening in the pictures. While your children are looking at the pictures, you could read verses that describe these events (see Matthew 26:36–46 ; 27:35–50 ; Luke 22:39–46 ; John 19:16–30 ). Your children could point out details in the pictures that they hear in the verses.\nLeft: Christ in Gethsemane , by Harry Anderson. Right: The Crucifixion , by Harry Anderson\nHow are we blessed because of Jesus’s sacrifice for us? Help your children look for words and phrases that answer this question in Isaiah 53:4–12 ; Alma 7:11–13 ; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19 . Share with each other how you feel about the Savior after reading these scriptures.\nYou could use this week’s activity page or other pictures in this outline to tell your children the story of the Resurrection (see also “ Jesus Is Risen ,” in New Testament Stories , 139–44). Then let your children tell the story back to you.\nConsider how you will help your children find joy in Christ this Easter. For example, you could sing together a favorite Easter hymn, such as “ Christ the Lord Is Risen Today ” ( Hymns , no. 200) or “Gethsemane” (Gospel Library). To find other songs about the Resurrection, you could look in the topical index of Hymns and Children’s Songbook . You and your children could share with each other why you like these songs and how you feel when you sing them. What do these songs teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\nChildren can feel the Spirit but may need help recognizing His influence. “Teach children about the different ways the Spirit communicates with us. Help them recognize His voice as He speaks to them. This will help them develop a habit of seeking and acting on personal revelation throughout their lives” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 32 ). For example, as you sing songs about the Savior with your children, look at pictures of Him, or read stories about Him, share with each other the spiritual feelings you have.\nGospel Library has a collection of Easter videos that your children might enjoy. Maybe you could let them pick one to watch. Ask them what they learn about Jesus Christ from the video. You might also ask them to summarize the message of the video in one sentence.\nAs you and your children watch general conference together this Easter weekend, help them notice when the Savior’s special witnesses bear testimony of the Resurrection. Perhaps you could make a game of it—invite them to stand every time they hear words like Easter or Atonement or Resurrection . Share with each other why you’re grateful for the living prophets’ testimonies of the Savior.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Jesus Christ suffered and died for me.\nThe week of Easter is a good time to teach your children about what the Savior did for us in Gethsemane and on the cross.

The Lord will help your children throughout their lives when they have faith in His power. To help them learn from this story, you could give each child a paper divided into 10 sections, and invite them to draw pictures of the plagues described in these verses: Exodus 7:17–18 ; 8:1–4 ; 8:16–17 ; 8:20–22 ; 9:1–6 ; 9:8–9 ; 9:22–23 ; 10:4–5 ; 10:21–22 ; 11:4–7 (see also “ The Plagues of Egypt ” in Old Testament Stories , 67–69). Read together Exodus 7:5 and 9:14 to explain why the Lord sent the plagues.\nThe Plagues of Egypt\nShare with your children how the Lord has shown you “that there is none like [Him] in all the earth” ( Exodus 9:14 ). Let them share how they know that the Lord is powerful.\nExodus 8:28–32 ; 9:7\nTo help your children visualize what it means to have a soft heart, it might be fun to show them an object that is hard, such as a rock, and another that is soft and absorbent, such as a sponge. You could also pour water over these objects to demonstrate how easily a soft heart receives the word of the Lord. You could then read together a few verses describing how Pharaoh responded to the plagues sent by the Lord (see Exodus 8:28–32 ; 9:7 ). Which of the objects best represents Pharaoh’s heart or attitude? What does it mean to have a soft heart? (see Mosiah 3:19 ). Elder Christopher H. Kim’s message “ Harden Not Your Heart ” could also help your children understand the difference between a hard heart and a soft one ( Liahona , May 2025, 118–20, especially the fifth paragraph).\nYou and your children could make a list of some actions that might show when we have a hard heart (for example, using unkind words or being unwilling to share). How can we show the Lord we want to have soft hearts?\nExodus 12:1–13\nThe Passover taught the Israelites to look forward to the Savior and His sacrifice for us. As you explore Exodus 12:1–13 together, help your children see connections between the details of the Passover and Jesus Christ’s Atonement (see also “ The Passover ” in Old Testament Stories , 70–74). For example, how is Jesus like the lamb described in verse 5 ?\nThe Passover\nToday, we take the sacrament to remember Jesus’s sacrifice. You could show your children a picture of the sacrament and talk about how this ordinance helps us remember Jesus Christ. You might help your children find the word “remember” in the sacrament prayers (see Moroni 4–5 ). Or sing together a favorite hymn about the sacrament, and help your children notice the peaceful feeling they have when they think about the Savior. How can we seek that feeling when we take the sacrament?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The Lord has power over all things.\nExodus 7–11\nThe plagues described in Exodus 7–11 showed the Egyptians and the Israelites that the Lord has great power. The Lord will help your children throughout their lives when they have faith in His power. To help them learn from this story, you could give each child a paper divided into 10 sections, and invite them to draw pictures of the plagues described in these verses: Exodus 7:17–18 ; 8:1–4 ; 8:16–17 ; 8:20–22 ; 9:1–6 ; 9:8–9 ; 9:22–23 ; 10:4–5 ; 10:21–22 ; 11:4–7 (see also “ The Plagues of Egypt ” in Old Testament Stories , 67–69). Read together Exodus 7:5 and 9:14 to explain why the Lord sent the plagues.\nThe Plagues of Egypt\nShare with your children how the Lord has shown you “that there is none like [Him] in all the earth” ( Exodus 9:14 ). Let them share how they know that the Lord is powerful.\n## The Lord can help me have a soft heart.\nExodus 8:28–32 ; 9:7\nTo help your children visualize what it means to have a soft heart, it might be fun to show them an object that is hard, such as a rock, and another that is soft and absorbent, such as a sponge. You could also pour water over these objects to demonstrate how easily a soft heart receives the word of the Lord. You could then read together a few verses describing how Pharaoh responded to the plagues sent by the Lord (see Exodus 8:28–32 ; 9:7 ). Which of the objects best represents Pharaoh’s heart or attitude? What does it mean to have a soft heart? (see Mosiah 3:19 ). Elder Christopher H. Kim’s message “ Harden Not Your Heart ” could also help your children understand the difference between a hard heart and a soft one ( Liahona , May 2025, 118–20, especially the fifth paragraph).\nYou and your children could make a list of some actions that might show when we have a hard heart (for example, using unkind words or being unwilling to share). How can we show the Lord we want to have soft hearts?\n## The sacrament can help me remember Jesus.\nExodus 12:1–13\nThe Passover taught the Israelites to look forward to the Savior and His sacrifice for us. As you explore Exodus 12:1–13 together, help your children see connections between the details of the Passover and Jesus Christ’s Atonement (see also “ The Passover ” in Old Testament Stories , 70–74). For example, how is Jesus like the lamb described in verse 5 ?\nThe Passover\nToday, we take the sacrament to remember Jesus’s sacrifice. You could show your children a picture of the sacrament and talk about how this ordinance helps us remember Jesus Christ. You might help your children find the word “remember” in the sacrament prayers (see Moroni 4–5 ). Or sing together a favorite hymn about the sacrament, and help your children notice the peaceful feeling they have when they think about the Savior. How can we seek that feeling when we take the sacrament?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

As you read Exodus 20:3–17 together, let your children help you find or draw a picture to represent each of the Ten Commandments. Then your children could take turns choosing a picture and talking about how they can live that commandment. Share with each other how living that commandment brings you happiness.\nYou could also sing a song like “ Keep the Commandments ” ( Children’s Songbook , 146–47). Help your children find words in the song that teach them why God wants us to keep His commandments.\nWhen children share spiritual experiences, their testimony grows. The questions you ask can encourage your children to share how they feel about the Savior and how living the gospel has blessed them (see Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 32 ). When they do this, they are bearing testimony. Consider how you can do this as you discuss the blessings that come from living the Ten Commandments.\nExodus 20:12\nHelp your children learn the phrase “Honour thy father and thy mother” ( Exodus 20:12 ). You may want to explain that to “honor” someone can mean to show respect for them or to bring them happiness. What did Jesus do to honor His mortal mother and His Heavenly Father? (see Luke 2:48–51 ; John 19:26–27 ). Perhaps your children could take turns acting out things they can do to honor their parents, while the other children guess what they are doing.\nExodus 31:13, 16–17\nYour children might enjoy looking at examples of signs—such as road signs or signs on a building.

  17-thoughts,The Tabernacle and Sacrifice,"","Exodus 25–30,35–40,Leviticus 1–9,16–17,Alma 25:16,Exodus 25:8,Exodus 26:34,Exodus 19:6,1 Nephi 10:21,Hebrews 9:11","## The Tabernacle Strengthens Faith in Jesus Christ\nWhen God commanded Moses to build a tabernacle in the camp of the Israelites, He stated its purpose: “that I may dwell among them” ( Exodus 25:8 ). Within the tabernacle, the presence of God was represented by the ark of the covenant—a wooden box, covered with gold, containing the written record of God’s covenant with His people. The ark was kept in the holiest, innermost room, separated from the rest of the tabernacle by a veil. This veil can symbolize our separation from the presence of God because of the Fall, as well as our way back to Him—through the Savior.\nOther than Moses, we know of only one person who could enter that “most holy place” ( Exodus 26:34 )—the high priest. Like the other priests, he first had to be washed and anointed and dressed in sacred clothing symbolic of his office. Once a year, on a day called the Day of Atonement, the high priest would offer sacrifices on behalf of the people before entering the tabernacle alone. At the veil, he would burn incense. The scented smoke ascending to heaven represented the prayers of the people ascending to God. Then the high priest, carrying blood from an animal sacrifice, would pass through the veil and approach the throne of God, symbolized by the ark of the covenant.\nKnowing what you know about Jesus Christ and His role in Heavenly Father’s plan, can you see how the tabernacle points us to the Savior? Just as the tabernacle, and the ark within it, represented God’s presence among His people, Jesus Christ was God’s presence among His people. Like the high priest, Jesus Christ is the Mediator between us and God the Father. He passed through the veil to make intercession for us by virtue of the blood of His own sacrifice.\nSome aspects of Israel’s tabernacle may sound familiar to you, especially if you have been to the temple to receive your own ordinances. The temple is the house of the Lord—His dwelling place among His people. Like the tabernacle’s most holy place, the temple’s celestial room represents the presence of God. To enter, we must first be washed and anointed. We wear sacred clothing. We make covenants. We pray at an altar from which prayers ascend to God. And we finally pass through a veil into God’s presence.\nPerhaps the most important similarity between modern temples and the ancient tabernacle is that both, if understood correctly, strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ and fill us with gratitude for His atoning sacrifice. God wants all of His children to enter into His presence; He wants “a kingdom of priests” and priestesses ( Exodus 19:6 ). But our sins prevent us from obtaining that blessing, for “no unclean thing can dwell with God” ( 1 Nephi 10:21 ). So God the Father sent Jesus Christ, our “high priest of good things to come” ( Hebrews 9:11 ). He parts the veil for us and empowers all of God’s people to “come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy” ( Hebrews 4:16 ).\nToday, the purpose of temples is more than obtaining exaltation for ourselves. After receiving our own ordinances and making covenants with God, we can stand in the place of our ancestors and receive ordinances on their behalf. In a sense, we can become something like the ancient high priest—and the Great High Priest—opening the way to God’s presence for others.\n## Sacrifice Strengthens Faith in Jesus Christ\nThe principles of atonement and reconciliation are taught powerfully in the ancient practice of animal sacrifice, which existed long before the law of Moses. Adam and Eve offered sacrifice. They understood its symbolic reference to the Savior’s sacrifice. And they taught this to their children.\nThe symbolism of animal sacrifice may have seemed especially poignant on ancient Israel’s Day of Atonement (“Yom Kippur” in Hebrew). The need for this annual ceremony was expressed in Leviticus 16:30 : “On that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.” This allowed God’s presence to remain among the people. This atonement was accomplished through a variety of ceremonies. In one of these, a goat was killed as an offering for the sins of the people, and the high priest took the goat’s blood into the most holy place. Later, the high priest laid his hands on a live goat and confessed the sins of the children of Israel—symbolically transferring those sins to the goat. The goat was then driven out of the camp of Israel.\nIn these rituals, the goats symbolized Jesus Christ, taking the place of the sinful people. Sin must not be allowed in God’s presence. But rather than destroy or drive out the sinners, God provided another way—a goat would be killed or driven out instead. “And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities” ( Leviticus 16:22 ).\nThese rituals pointed to the way God has provided to bring us back into His presence—Jesus Christ and His Atonement. The Savior has “borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” even “the iniquity of us all” ( Isaiah 53:4, 6 ). He stood in our place, gave His life to pay the penalty of sin, and then conquered death through His Resurrection. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ was the “great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast” but rather “an infinite and eternal sacrifice” ( Alma 34:10 ). He was the fulfillment of everything the ancient sacrifices pointed toward.\nFor this reason, after His sacrifice was complete, He said, “Ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices … shall be done away. … And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit” ( 3 Nephi 9:19–20 ).\nSo when you find passages in the Old Testament about sacrifices and the tabernacle (or, later, the temple)—and you’ll find a lot of them—remember that the primary purpose of it all is to strengthen your faith in the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Connect what you read and learn with your worship in His house. Let your heart and your mind turn to Him. Ponder what He has done to bring you back into God’s presence—and what you will do to follow Him."

Oaks, “ Two Lines of Communication ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2010, 83–86.\nFocus on what’s most important. Some people get overwhelmed with the weekly reading suggestions in Come, Follow Me . As you review the outlines, follow the Spirit. Consider your own needs and the needs of the people you may be teaching. Understanding and fully applying one principle in a week could be more helpful than reading several chapters only superficially.\n## “Moses was very meek.”\nNumbers 12:3\nSome people are surprised to learn that Moses, the mighty leader who stood before Pharaoh and performed stunning miracles with the Lord’s power, was also “very meek” ( Numbers 12:3 ). What does it mean to be meek? Consider studying Elder David A. Bednar’s explanation in “ Meek and Lowly of Heart ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 30–33) or “ Meek, Meekness ” in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).\nWhat do you learn from Moses’s examples of meekness in Exodus 18:13–25 ; Numbers 11:26–29 ; Numbers 12 ; Hebrews 11:24–27 ; and Moses 1:10–11 ? You might also ponder how the Savior showed meekness (see Matthew 11:29 ; 27:11–14 ; Luke 22:41–42 ; John 13:4–5 ). What do these examples teach you?\n## With faith in the Lord, I can have hope for the future.\nNumbers 13–14\nAs you read Numbers 13–14 , try to put yourself in the place of the Israelites. Why do you think they wanted to “return into Egypt”? ( Numbers 14:3 ). How would you describe the other “spirit” Caleb had? ( Numbers 14:24 ). What impresses you about the faith of Caleb and Joshua, and how might you apply their examples to situations you face?\nTen of the Israelite spies were afraid; Joshua and Caleb had faith.

Read their teachings about this story in 1 Nephi 17:40–41 ; Alma 33:18–22 ; and Helaman 8:13–15 . Here are some questions to ponder as you do:\nWhat could the brass serpent represent?\nWhat might the snakebites represent?\nThe Israelites had to “[behold] the serpent of brass” ( Numbers 21:9 ) to be healed. Why do you think some people refused to look? Does something similar ever happen to you?\nWhat do you feel inspired to do to more fully “look upon the Son of God with faith” and be healed? ( Helaman 8:15 ). You may find some ideas in President D. Todd Christofferson’s message “ Look to God and Live ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2025, 86–90)\nReading these passages might remind you of other times in the scriptures when people needed to keep their focus on Christ. For example, compare the message of Numbers 21:4–9 with Matthew 14:25–31 and 1 Nephi 8:24–28 (see also the pictures at the end of this week’s outline). What tends to draw us away from Christ? How does He bless people who stay focused on Him?\nSee also “ Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee ” ( Hymns , no. 141).\n## I can follow God’s will, even if others try to persuade me not to.\nNumbers 22–24\nWhen Balak, the king of Moab, learned that the Israelites were approaching, he called for Balaam, a man known for pronouncing blessings and curses. Balak wanted him to curse the Israelites. Notice how Balak tried to persuade Balaam (see Numbers 22:5–7, 15–17 ), and think about temptations you might face to go against God’s will. What impresses you about Balaam’s responses in Numbers 22:18, 38 ; 23:8, 12, 26 ; 24:13 ? Sadly, Balaam eventually gave in to pressure and betrayed Israel (see Numbers 31:16 ; Jude 1:11 ). Ponder how you can remain faithful to the Lord despite pressure from others.\n## Scripture Helps\nWhat was significant about Oshea being called Joshua?\nWho was Balaam?\nClick to see more.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nNumbers 11:4–10\nAsk your children if they remember some of the miracles the Lord performed to help the Israelites (see “ The Plagues of Egypt ” and “ The Passover ” in Old Testament Stories , 67–74). Then you could summarize for them Numbers 11:4–10 , emphasizing that the Israelites had forgotten their blessings and were complaining. What blessings do we sometimes forget?\nAs you sing or listen to a song about gratitude, such as “ Count Your Blessings ” ( Hymns , no. 241), your children could draw pictures of blessings the Lord has given them.\nNumbers 12\nTo introduce Numbers 12 , you could tell your children that the Lord was unhappy with Aaron and Miriam, Moses’s brother and sister. Invite them to read Numbers 12:1–8 to find out why. Consider using the Gospel Art Book to help your children find examples of people in the scriptures who respected the Lord’s prophet and were blessed. How are we blessed when we follow the Lord’s prophet?\nNumbers 21:6–9\nYou could use “ Moses and the Brass Serpent ” in Old Testament Stories , 83–84, to help your children learn what happened in Numbers 21:6–9 . How is the brass serpent like Jesus Christ? (see John 3:14–15 ). Your children might enjoy making a serpent out of paper and writing on it some simple things they can do to “look upon the Son of God with faith” ( Helaman 8:15 ).\nMoses and the Brass Serpent\nOlder children could choose one of the following scriptures and share what it adds to their understanding of the story: 1 Nephi 17:41 ; Alma 33:18–20 ; Helaman 8:13–15 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 .\nBronze Serpent , by Brent Evans\nNumbers 22–24\nSummarize Numbers 22:1–18 for your children, emphasizing how Balaam refused to curse God’s people, even though Balak, the king of Moab, offered him honor and riches. Then you could help your children search the following verses for phrases that they feel show that Balaam wanted to follow God: Numbers 22:18 ; 23:26 ; 24:13 .

  20-thoughts,The Historical Books in the Old Testament,"","2 Kings 22–25,2 Chronicles 34–36,1 Nephi 13:28,verses 26, 29, 40,2 Samuel 10–12,1 Chronicles 19–20,1 Kings 10–11,2 Chronicles 9,Articles of Faith 1:8","## A Matter of Perspective\nNaturally, these stories are told from a certain point of view. Just as it’s impossible to look at a flower, rock, or tree from more than one angle at a time, it’s inevitable that a historical account will reflect the perspective of the person or group of people writing it. This perspective includes the writers’ national or ethnic ties and their cultural norms and beliefs. Knowing this can help us understand that the writers and compilers of the historical books focused on certain details while leaving out others. They made assumptions that others would not have made. And they came to conclusions based on these details and assumptions. We can even see different perspectives across the books of the Bible (and sometimes within the same book). The more we’re aware of these perspectives, the better we can understand the historical books.\nOne perspective common to all the Old Testament historical books is the perspective of the children of Israel, God’s covenant people. Their faith in the Lord helped them see His hand in their lives and in the affairs of their nation. While secular history books don’t tend to see things this way, this spiritual perspective is part of what makes the Old Testament historical books so valuable to people who are seeking to build their own faith in God.\n## Context for the Rest of the Old Testament\nThe historical books begin where the book of Deuteronomy leaves off, with the Israelites’ years of wandering in the wilderness about to end. The book of Joshua shows the children of Israel ready to enter Canaan, their promised land, and describes how they took it over. The books that follow, Judges through 2 Chronicles, depict Israel’s experience in the promised land, from the time they settled it until the time they were conquered by Assyria and Babylon. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah tell of the return of several groups of Israelites to their capital, Jerusalem, decades later. Finally, the book of Esther relates a story of Israelites living in exile under Persian rule.\nAnd that’s where the chronology of the Old Testament ends. Some first-time Bible readers are surprised to find that they’ve actually finished reading the story of the Old Testament before they’ve read much more than half its pages. After Esther, we don’t get much information about the history of the Israelites. Instead, the books that follow—especially the books of the prophets—fit within the timeline that the historical books presented. The ministry of the prophet Jeremiah, for example, took place during the events recorded in 2 Kings 22–25 (and the parallel account in 2 Chronicles 34–36 ). Knowing this can influence the way you read both the historical narratives and the prophetic books.\n## When Something Doesn’t Fit\nWhen reading the Old Testament, as with any history, you’re likely to read about people doing or saying things that, to modern eyes, seem strange or even troubling. We should expect this—Old Testament writers saw the world from a perspective that was, in some ways, quite different from ours. Violence, ethnic relations, and the roles of women are just some of the issues that ancient writers might have seen differently than we do today.\nSo what should we do when we come across passages in the scriptures that seem troubling? First, it might help to consider each passage in a broader context. How does it fit in God’s plan of salvation? How does it fit with what you know about the nature of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How does it fit with revealed truths in other scriptures or with the teachings of living prophets? And how does it fit with the whisperings of the Spirit to your own heart and mind?\nIn some cases, the passage may not seem to fit well with any of these. Sometimes the passage may be like a puzzle piece that doesn’t look like it has a place among the pieces you’ve already assembled. Trying to force the piece to fit isn’t the best approach. But neither is giving up on the entire puzzle. Instead, you may need to set the piece aside for a time. As you learn more and put together more of the puzzle, you may be able to better see how the pieces fit together.\nIt can also help to remember that in addition to being limited to a particular perspective, scriptural histories are subject to human error. For example, over the centuries, “many plain and precious things [were] taken away from the [Bible],” including important truths about doctrine, ordinances, and covenants ( 1 Nephi 13:28 ; see also verses 26, 29, 40 ). At the same time, we should be willing to admit that our own perspectives are also limited: there will always be things we don’t fully understand and questions we can’t yet answer.\nSome scripture passages may be like puzzle pieces that we don’t know how to fit with the rest of the puzzle.\n## Finding the Gems\nBut in the meantime, unanswered questions shouldn’t keep us from the precious gems of eternal truth that are found in the Old Testament—even if these gems are sometimes hidden in the rocky ground of troubling experiences and poor choices made by imperfect people. Perhaps the most precious of these gems are the stories and passages that testify of God’s love—especially those that point our minds toward the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Viewed from any angle, gems like these shine just as brightly today as they did back then. And because these accounts tell of the covenant people of God—men and women who had human weaknesses and yet loved and served the Lord—gems of truth abound in the historical books of the Old Testament."

Notice what the Lord said in Joshua 1:1–9 to encourage him. Think about the difficult challenges you face; what in these verses gives you courage?\nThe name Joshua ( Yehoshua or Yeshua in Hebrew) means “Jehovah saves.” And the name Jesus comes from Yeshua . So as you read about Joshua, consider his role in leading the children of Israel across the Jordan River and into the promised land. How was his mission similar to what Christ does for us?\nJoshua 1:8\nAs He encouraged Joshua, the Lord gave counsel in Joshua 1:8 about the scriptures, or “the word of the law.” Considering Joshua’s heavy responsibility, why might this counsel have been especially helpful?\nWhen the Lord invites us to read the scriptures, He often uses words that go beyond just reading. He also promises great blessings.

So as you read together Joshua 3–4 (or “ Joshua the Prophet ” in Old Testament Stories , 85–89), you could also look at a picture of Jesus being baptized and explain that Jesus was baptized in the same river the Israelites crossed.

Here are some questions to help you consider how her experience might apply to your life:\nHow would you describe the conditions the Israelites were in at the time? (see verses 1–3 ). What similarities do you see to conditions today—in individuals and society?\nWhat words or actions of Deborah show you that she had faith in the Lord? How did her faith influence others?

But when Ruth’s husband died, her situation was especially hard. In Israelite culture at the time, a woman without a husband or sons had no right to property and very few ways to earn a living. As you read Ruth’s story, notice how the Lord turned tragedy into great blessings. What do you notice about Ruth that might have helped her? How did Boaz redeem Ruth from her desperate situation? (see Ruth 4:4–10 ). How were both Ruth and Boaz like Jesus Christ?\nSee also “ Be Still, My Soul ,” Hymns , no. 124.\nRuth ; 1 Samuel 1\nPerhaps you have suffered a great loss, as Ruth and Naomi did (see Ruth 1:1–5 ). Or maybe, like Hannah, you long for blessings you have not yet received (see 1 Samuel 1:1–10 ). How did these women show their faith in God? What do you learn from their examples?\nOf course, not everyone who prays for a child receives one, and not everyone whose spouse dies remarries. But everyone who turns to the Savior receives His help and guidance. Consider how you have “come to trust” the Lord ( Ruth 2:12 ) during your difficult times.\nSee also Amy A.

As you read 1 Samuel 4–6 , think about why that didn’t work. (Note also the unrighteous actions of Eli’s sons, who served as priests in the tabernacle, in 1 Samuel 2:12–25 .) What do you think the Lord was trying to teach His people? What do you learn from what happened to the Philistines after capturing the ark? (see chapters 5–6 ). What do you learn from Israel’s efforts to regain the Lord’s protection in 1 Samuel 7 ?\nYou might be inspired by reading Hannah’s poem of praise in 1 Samuel 2:1–10 . What do you find in her words that could have helped Eli’s sons and the rest of the Israelites?\n1 Samuel 3\nAt times, you may feel like Samuel, who heard the voice of the Lord but did not recognize it. Like all of us, Samuel had to learn how to recognize the Lord’s voice. As you study 1 Samuel 3 , what do you learn from this young boy about hearing and obeying the Lord’s voice? You might also search these additional scriptures and make a list of guidelines that can help a person recognize the Lord’s voice: 1 Kings 19:11–12 ; Luke 24:15–32 ; 3 Nephi 11:3–7 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23 ; 8:2–3 ; 9:7–9 .\nOther times, you may feel that the heavens are shut and that God does not want to communicate with you.

But when Ruth’s husband died, her situation was especially hard. In Israelite culture at the time, a woman without a husband or sons had no right to property and very few ways to earn a living. As you read Ruth’s story, notice how the Lord turned tragedy into great blessings. What do you notice about Ruth that might have helped her? How did Boaz redeem Ruth from her desperate situation? (see Ruth 4:4–10 ). How were both Ruth and Boaz like Jesus Christ?\nSee also “ Be Still, My Soul ,” Hymns , no. 124.\n## I can trust that God will guide and help me regardless of my situation.\nRuth ; 1 Samuel 1\nPerhaps you have suffered a great loss, as Ruth and Naomi did (see Ruth 1:1–5 ). Or maybe, like Hannah, you long for blessings you have not yet received (see 1 Samuel 1:1–10 ). How did these women show their faith in God? What do you learn from their examples?\nOf course, not everyone who prays for a child receives one, and not everyone whose spouse dies remarries. But everyone who turns to the Savior receives His help and guidance. Consider how you have “come to trust” the Lord ( Ruth 2:12 ) during your difficult times.\nSee also Amy A.

As you read 1 Samuel 4–6 , think about why that didn’t work. (Note also the unrighteous actions of Eli’s sons, who served as priests in the tabernacle, in 1 Samuel 2:12–25 .) What do you think the Lord was trying to teach His people? What do you learn from what happened to the Philistines after capturing the ark? (see chapters 5–6 ). What do you learn from Israel’s efforts to regain the Lord’s protection in 1 Samuel 7 ?\nYou might be inspired by reading Hannah’s poem of praise in 1 Samuel 2:1–10 . What do you find in her words that could have helped Eli’s sons and the rest of the Israelites?\n## I can hear and obey the voice of the Lord.\n1 Samuel 3\nAt times, you may feel like Samuel, who heard the voice of the Lord but did not recognize it. Like all of us, Samuel had to learn how to recognize the Lord’s voice. As you study 1 Samuel 3 , what do you learn from this young boy about hearing and obeying the Lord’s voice? You might also search these additional scriptures and make a list of guidelines that can help a person recognize the Lord’s voice: 1 Kings 19:11–12 ; Luke 24:15–32 ; 3 Nephi 11:3–7 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23 ; 8:2–3 ; 9:7–9 .\nOther times, you may feel that the heavens are shut and that God does not want to communicate with you. President Russell M. Nelson said, “Does God really want to speak to you? Yes!” (“ Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 93–96).

Of course, we usually focus on David. But this time, as you study 1 Samuel 17 , ponder also the words of other people in this chapter (see the list below). What do you learn about them and their motives? What do you learn about David? How is he different?\nGoliath: verses 8–10, 43–44\nEliab: verse 28\nSaul: verse 33\nDavid: verses 26, 32, 34–37, 39, 45–47\nYour story, though not as well-known as David’s, is sure to include Goliath-size challenges to overcome and opportunities to exercise faith in the Lord. What does David’s example teach you about facing the adversity in your story? You might also read President Camille N. Johnson’s message “ Invite Christ to Author Your Story ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2021, 80–82) with one of your challenges in mind. Look for answers to questions like these: How does the Lord want me to view my challenges? How has He helped me in the past? How can I show that I trust Him to write my story?\nYou may already know that there are some tragic chapters later in David’s story (see, for example, 2 Samuel 11 ). If you had the opportunity to give David some advice after his battle with Goliath, what would you say? How might this advice apply to your life?\nSee also “The Lord Will Deliver Me” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Lord Will Deliver Me\n1 Samuel 17:26–50\nIn addition to personal challenges, we also face large, complex problems that affect the whole world. When forces of evil are “gathered together … to battle” against the forces of good ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ), we might wonder how our individual efforts could possibly make a difference. What do you find in David’s story that gives you hope? Sister Andrea M. Spannaus taught that the five stones David carried into his battle with Goliath could represent things we need to win our spiritual battles. Read her message “ Faithful to the End ” ( Liahona , May 2024, 59–61). How can you access these sources of strength in your life?\nSee also “ Let Us All Press On ,” Hymns , no. 243.\nTrue Friendship and Self-Respect , by Wilson Ong (detail)\n1 Samuel 18\nAs you read 1 Samuel 18 , consider contrasting Saul and his son Jonathan (who, if not for David, could have assumed he would be the next king). How did Saul and Jonathan react to David’s success? What can you learn from this experience?\nWhat do you find in Jonathan’s attitudes and actions that reminds you of Jesus Christ?\n“Liken the scriptures” ( 1 Nephi 19:23 ). The scriptures provide great opportunities to learn from the motivations and actions of people like David, Jonathan, and Saul. You’ll find that no one in the scriptures is flawless. So as you read, for example, about David’s faithful choices, be open to learning also from his mistakes. Doing so can help us identify potential weaknesses in ourselves and “learn to be more wise than [others] have been” ( Mormon 9:31 ).\n1 Samuel 24–26\nIn 1 Samuel 24–26 , look for lessons about pride, forgiveness, and self-control. You might also consider reading Elder Mark A. Bragg’s message “ Christlike Poise ” as part of your study ( Liahona , May 2023, 60–63). How did David, Abigail, and others demonstrate—or fail to demonstrate—Christlike poise in these chapters? What opportunities do you have to show Christlike poise?\nSister Kristen Yee’s message “ Beauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2022, 36–39) can help you study 1 Samuel 25 . How is Abigail like Jesus Christ?\n2 Samuel 5:17–25\nEven after David defeated Goliath, his problems with the Philistines were not over. As you read 2 Samuel 5:17–25 , consider how David’s example can help you in the challenges you face (see also 1 Samuel 23:2, 10–11 ; 30:8 ; 2 Samuel 2:1 ). How are you being blessed by acting on the revelation you receive?\n2 Samuel 7\nWhen David offered to build a house, meaning a temple, for the Lord (see 2 Samuel 7:1–3 ), the Lord responded that David’s son would build it (see verses 12–15 ; see also 1 Chronicles 17:1–15 ). The Lord also said that He in turn would build David a “house,” meaning a posterity, and that his throne would last forever (see 2 Samuel 7:11, 16, 25–29 ; Psalm 89:3–4, 35–37 ). This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our Eternal King, who was a descendant of David (see Matthew 1:1 ; Luke 1:32–33 ; John 18:33–37 ).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\nWhat is meant by the title “Lord of Hosts”?\nWhy was Uzzah smitten by God for trying to steady the ark?\nClick to see more.\n## With the help of the Lord, I can overcome any challenge.\n1 Samuel 17\nThe story of David and Goliath is one of the best-known stories in the scriptures.

How might this advice apply to your life?\nSee also “The Lord Will Deliver Me” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Lord Will Deliver Me\n## One person with faith in Christ can make a difference.\n1 Samuel 17:26–50\nIn addition to personal challenges, we also face large, complex problems that affect the whole world. When forces of evil are “gathered together … to battle” against the forces of good ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ), we might wonder how our individual efforts could possibly make a difference. What do you find in David’s story that gives you hope? Sister Andrea M. Spannaus taught that the five stones David carried into his battle with Goliath could represent things we need to win our spiritual battles. Read her message “ Faithful to the End ” ( Liahona , May 2024, 59–61). How can you access these sources of strength in your life?\nSee also “ Let Us All Press On ,” Hymns , no. 243.\nTrue Friendship and Self-Respect , by Wilson Ong (detail)\n## “Jonathan loved [David] as his own soul.”\n1 Samuel 18\nAs you read 1 Samuel 18 , consider contrasting Saul and his son Jonathan (who, if not for David, could have assumed he would be the next king). How did Saul and Jonathan react to David’s success? What can you learn from this experience?\nWhat do you find in Jonathan’s attitudes and actions that reminds you of Jesus Christ?\n“Liken the scriptures” ( 1 Nephi 19:23 ). The scriptures provide great opportunities to learn from the motivations and actions of people like David, Jonathan, and Saul. You’ll find that no one in the scriptures is flawless. So as you read, for example, about David’s faithful choices, be open to learning also from his mistakes. Doing so can help us identify potential weaknesses in ourselves and “learn to be more wise than [others] have been” ( Mormon 9:31 ).\n## Forgiveness is the sure path to peace and healing.\n1 Samuel 24–26\nIn 1 Samuel 24–26 , look for lessons about pride, forgiveness, and self-control. You might also consider reading Elder Mark A. Bragg’s message “ Christlike Poise ” as part of your study ( Liahona , May 2023, 60–63). How did David, Abigail, and others demonstrate—or fail to demonstrate—Christlike poise in these chapters? What opportunities do you have to show Christlike poise?\nSister Kristen Yee’s message “ Beauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2022, 36–39) can help you study 1 Samuel 25 . How is Abigail like Jesus Christ?\n## The Lord can give me direction.\n2 Samuel 5:17–25\nEven after David defeated Goliath, his problems with the Philistines were not over. As you read 2 Samuel 5:17–25 , consider how David’s example can help you in the challenges you face (see also 1 Samuel 23:2, 10–11 ; 30:8 ; 2 Samuel 2:1 ). How are you being blessed by acting on the revelation you receive?\n## What is the “house” the Lord promised to David?\n2 Samuel 7\nWhen David offered to build a house, meaning a temple, for the Lord (see 2 Samuel 7:1–3 ), the Lord responded that David’s son would build it (see verses 12–15 ; see also 1 Chronicles 17:1–15 ). The Lord also said that He in turn would build David a “house,” meaning a posterity, and that his throne would last forever (see 2 Samuel 7:11, 16, 25–29 ; Psalm 89:3–4, 35–37 ). This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our Eternal King, who was a descendant of David (see Matthew 1:1 ; Luke 1:32–33 ; John 18:33–37 ).\n## Scripture Helps\nWhat is meant by the title “Lord of Hosts”?\nWhy was Uzzah smitten by God for trying to steady the ark?\nClick to see more.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\n1 Samuel 17:20–54\nYou may want to use “ David and Goliath ” in Old Testament Stories , 112–16, to help your children become familiar with what happened in 1 Samuel 17:20–54 .

These Israelites became known as “the lost tribes,” in part because they were removed from their homeland and scattered among other nations. But they were also lost in a deeper sense: over time they lost their sense of identity as God’s covenant people.\nEventually many people in the Southern Kingdom of Judah also turned away from the Lord. The Assyrians attacked and conquered most of that kingdom too; only Jerusalem was miraculously preserved. Later, between 597 and 580 BC, the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem, including the temple, and took many people captive. About 70 years later, a remnant of Judah was allowed to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. Many, however, stayed in Babylon.\nThe Destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuzar-adan , by William Brassey Hole, © Providence Collection/licensed from goodsalt.com\nAs time passed, Israelites from all the tribes were “scattered … with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not” ( Zechariah 7:14 ). Some the Lord led away to other lands. Others left Israel to escape capture or for political or economic reasons.\nWe call all these events the scattering of Israel. And it’s important to know about the scattering for several reasons. For one thing, it’s a major topic of the Old Testament—many Old Testament prophets were witnesses of the spiritual downfall that led to the scattering. They foresaw it and warned about it. Some of them even lived through it. That’s helpful to remember when you read the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and other prophets in the latter part of the Old Testament. With this context in mind, when you read their prophecies about Assyria and Babylon, idolatry and captivity, destruction and eventual restoration, you will know what they’re talking about.\nUnderstanding the scattering of Israel will help you understand the Book of Mormon better too, because the Book of Mormon is a record of a branch of scattered Israel. This record begins with Lehi’s family fleeing Jerusalem around 600 BC, just before the Babylonians attacked. Lehi was one of those prophets who prophesied about the scattering of Israel. And his family helped fulfill that prophecy, taking their branch of Israel and planting it on the other side of the world, in the Americas.\n## The Gathering\nThe scattering of Israel, however, is only half the story. The Lord doesn’t forget His people, nor does He abandon them, even when they have abandoned Him. The many prophecies that God would scatter Israel were accompanied by many promises that He would one day gather them.\nThat day is today—our day. The gathering has already begun. In 1836, thousands of years after Moses gathered the children of Israel at the foot of Mount Sinai, he appeared in the Kirtland Temple to give Joseph Smith “the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth” ( Doctrine and Covenants 110:11 ). Now, with the direction of people who hold these keys, the tribes of Israel are being gathered from every nation where the Lord’s servants are able to go.\nMoses, Elias, and Elijah Appear in the Kirtland Temple , by Gary E. Smith\nPresident Russell M. Nelson has called this gathering “the most important thing taking place on earth today. Nothing else compares in magnitude, nothing else compares in importance, nothing else compares in majesty. And if you choose to, if you want to, you can be a big part of it.”\nHow can we help? What does it mean to gather Israel? Does it mean restoring the twelve tribes to the land they once inhabited? Actually, it means something much greater, much more eternal. As President Nelson explained:\n“When we speak of the gathering , we are simply saying this fundamental truth: every one of our Heavenly Father’s children, on both sides of the veil, deserves to hear the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. …\n“ Anytime you do anything that helps anyone —on either side of the veil—take a step toward making covenants with God and receiving their essential baptismal and temple ordinances, you are helping to gather Israel. It is as simple as that.”\nThis happens, as Isaiah said, “one by one” ( Isaiah 27:12 ) or, as Jeremiah predicted, “one of a city, and two of a family” ( Jeremiah 3:14 ).\nGathering Israel means bringing God’s children back to Him. It means restoring them to their covenant relationship with Him. It means reestablishing the “holy nation” He proposed to establish so long ago ( Exodus 19:6 ).\n## Come Home\nAs one who has made a covenant with God, you are part of the house of Israel. You have been gathered, and you are a gatherer. The centuries-long epic story of the covenant people is building to its climax, and you are a key player. Now is the time when “Jesus will say to all Israel, ‘Come home.’”\nThis is the message of the gatherers: Come home to the covenant. Come home to Zion. Come home to Jesus Christ, the Holy One of Israel, and He will bring you home to God, your Father."

For Hezekiah and his people, one of those challenges came when the Assyrian army approached Jerusalem. As you read 2 Kings 18–19 , imagine that you lived in Jerusalem during this time. How might you have felt, for example, hearing the Assyrians’ taunts in 2 Kings 18:28–37 ; 19:10–13 ? What would you have done? Compare the Assyrians’ reasons for the Israelites not to trust the Lord with the reasons Satan gives for us to doubt our faith today. You could also contrast the Assyrians’ reasons with your reasons why you do trust the Lord.\nWhat do you learn from Hezekiah’s actions in this situation? (see 2 Kings 19:1–7, 14–19 ). How did the Lord respond? (see 2 Kings 19:35–37 ). Why do you think Hezekiah remained faithful? (see 2 Kings 18:5–7 ). Ponder how the Lord has sustained you in challenging times. What do you feel inspired to do to increase your trust in Him?\nPresident Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “ Fear Not: Believe Only! ” ( Liahona , May 2022, 34–36) has helpful counsel for times of fear or doubt. A hymn like “ Let Us All Press On ” ( Hymns , no. 243) could also have encouraging messages. What do you find in these resources that helps you?\nSee also 2 Chronicles 31–32 ; 3 Nephi 3–4 ; Jörg Klebingat, “ Valiant Discipleship in the Latter Days ,” Liahona , May 2022, 107–10.\nUse scripture study helps. The Church provides many resources to help you understand the scriptures. For example, in the Gospel Library you can find the Guide to the Scriptures , Topics and Questions , and Church magazines . In addition, as you read the Old Testament, you can find helpful context and insights in the “Thoughts to Keep in Mind” articles in Come, Follow Me . The article titled “J esus Will Say to All Israel, ‘Come Home’ ” might help your study of 2 Kings 16–25 .\n2 Kings 19:20–37\nSennacherib, the king of Assyria, had good reason to believe that his army would conquer Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 17 ; 18:33–34 ; 19:11–13 ). But the Lord had a message regarding Sennacherib, given through the prophet Isaiah. It’s recorded in 2 Kings 19:20–34 . What truths do you find in the Lord’s message that help you have faith in Him and His plan?\n2 Kings 21–23\nHave you ever felt that you were lacking something spiritually? Maybe you felt that your relationship with God could be stronger. What helped you turn back to Him? Ponder these questions as you read 2 Kings 21–23 , which describes how the Kingdom of Judah fell away from the Lord under King Manasseh (see 2 Kings 21 ) and how King Josiah helped the people turn back to Him (see 2 Kings 22–23 ). How and why did Josiah and his people change? (see 2 Kings 22:8–11 ; 23:1–6, 21, 24 ).\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball called the story of King Josiah “one of the finest stories in all of the scriptures” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 62). Read President Kimball’s words about King Josiah ( pages 62–64 ). Perhaps you can think of an experience when a passage of scripture “work[ed] mightily” in you. What might you do to receive more experiences like that?\nSee also Alma 31:5 ; “Josiah and the Book of the Law” (video), Gospel Library.\nJosiah and the Book of the Law\n2 Kings 23:1–25\nWhat impresses you about the covenant Josiah made in 2 Kings 23:3 ? As you continue reading chapter 23 , notice what Josiah did to show his commitment to the Lord (see also the picture at the end of this outline). How can you show your commitment to Him?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## I can stay true to the Lord when my faith is challenged.\n2 Kings 18–19\nMost of us have experiences that challenge our faith. For Hezekiah and his people, one of those challenges came when the Assyrian army approached Jerusalem. As you read 2 Kings 18–19 , imagine that you lived in Jerusalem during this time. How might you have felt, for example, hearing the Assyrians’ taunts in 2 Kings 18:28–37 ; 19:10–13 ? What would you have done? Compare the Assyrians’ reasons for the Israelites not to trust the Lord with the reasons Satan gives for us to doubt our faith today. You could also contrast the Assyrians’ reasons with your reasons why you do trust the Lord.\nWhat do you learn from Hezekiah’s actions in this situation? (see 2 Kings 19:1–7, 14–19 ). How did the Lord respond? (see 2 Kings 19:35–37 ). Why do you think Hezekiah remained faithful? (see 2 Kings 18:5–7 ). Ponder how the Lord has sustained you in challenging times. What do you feel inspired to do to increase your trust in Him?\nPresident Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “ Fear Not: Believe Only! ” ( Liahona , May 2022, 34–36) has helpful counsel for times of fear or doubt. A hymn like “ Let Us All Press On ” ( Hymns , no. 243) could also have encouraging messages. What do you find in these resources that helps you?\nSee also 2 Chronicles 31–32 ; 3 Nephi 3–4 ; Jörg Klebingat, “ Valiant Discipleship in the Latter Days ,” Liahona , May 2022, 107–10.\nUse scripture study helps. The Church provides many resources to help you understand the scriptures. For example, in the Gospel Library you can find the Guide to the Scriptures , Topics and Questions , and Church magazines . In addition, as you read the Old Testament, you can find helpful context and insights in the “Thoughts to Keep in Mind” articles in Come, Follow Me . The article titled “J esus Will Say to All Israel, ‘Come Home’ ” might help your study of 2 Kings 16–25 .\n## All things are in the Lord’s hands.\n2 Kings 19:20–37\nSennacherib, the king of Assyria, had good reason to believe that his army would conquer Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 17 ; 18:33–34 ; 19:11–13 ). But the Lord had a message regarding Sennacherib, given through the prophet Isaiah. It’s recorded in 2 Kings 19:20–34 . What truths do you find in the Lord’s message that help you have faith in Him and His plan?\n## The scriptures can turn my heart to the Lord.\n2 Kings 21–23\nHave you ever felt that you were lacking something spiritually? Maybe you felt that your relationship with God could be stronger. What helped you turn back to Him? Ponder these questions as you read 2 Kings 21–23 , which describes how the Kingdom of Judah fell away from the Lord under King Manasseh (see 2 Kings 21 ) and how King Josiah helped the people turn back to Him (see 2 Kings 22–23 ). How and why did Josiah and his people change? (see 2 Kings 22:8–11 ; 23:1–6, 21, 24 ).\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball called the story of King Josiah “one of the finest stories in all of the scriptures” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 62). Read President Kimball’s words about King Josiah ( pages 62–64 ). Perhaps you can think of an experience when a passage of scripture “work[ed] mightily” in you.

How can you show your commitment to Him?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\n2 Kings 18:3–6 ; 19:14–19\nIn 2 Kings 18:3, 5–6 , help your children discover what made Hezekiah a good king. Then as you read together 2 Kings 19:14–19 , they could discover how he showed that he trusted the Lord. You could look at a picture of Jesus and talk about why we can trust Him. How can we show that we trust the Lord?\n2 Kings 22:1–7\nIn 2 Kings 22:1 , help your children discover how old Josiah was when he became king. What do we learn about Josiah in verse 2 ? Consider an activity that could illustrate following the Lord and not turning “aside to the right hand or to the left.”\nThe workers described in 2 Kings 22:3–7 were trusted with the money to rebuild the temple “because they dealt faithfully” ( verse 7 ). After reading these verses, you and your children could talk about things you have been trusted with. How can we be trustworthy like the workers in these verses?\nA scribe bringing a scroll of scripture to King Josiah; illustration by Robert T. Barrett\n2 Kings 22:8–11 ; 23:2–3\nTo introduce the story of King Josiah in 2 Kings 22–23 , you could hide a copy of the scriptures somewhere in the room. Invite your children to find it. Then you could share what happened when one of Josiah’s priests found the scriptures in the temple (see 2 Kings 22:8–11 ; see also “ King Josiah ” in Old Testament Stories , 148–49). What might happen to us if we didn’t have the scriptures? Share with each other why you are glad we have the scriptures today.\nKing Josiah\nAfter reading 2 Kings 23:2–3 , you and your children could talk about scriptures that have inspired you to “walk after the Lord” ( verse 3 ). You could also sing a song about the scriptures, such as “ Search, Ponder, and Pray ” ( Children’s Songbook , 109).\n2 Kings 23:1–3\nWhen Josiah and his people learned the commandments of God, they made a covenant to live them. Read about this with your children in 2 Kings 23:1–3 , and help them find words or phrases that show how the people felt about the Lord’s commandments. Maybe your children could stand and talk about what it might mean to “[stand] to the covenant.” Then they could walk in place and talk about what it might mean to “walk after the Lord.” Next, they could place their hands on their hearts and suggest ways we can keep our covenants “with all [our] heart.”\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## I can trust Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\n2 Kings 18:3–6 ; 19:14–19\nIn 2 Kings 18:3, 5–6 , help your children discover what made Hezekiah a good king.

Here’s a simple approach that can help you learn from these stories and consider how you can do the Lord’s work despite opposition:\nGod’s work for Zerubbabel ( Ezra 4:3 ):\nGod’s work for Nehemiah ( Nehemiah 2:17–18 ):\nGod’s work for me:\nOpposition Zerubbabel faced ( Ezra 4:4–24 ):\nOpposition Nehemiah faced ( Nehemiah 2:19 ; 4:1–3, 7–8 ; 6:1–13 ):\nOpposition I face:\nHow Zerubbabel responded ( Ezra 5:1–2 ):\nHow Nehemiah responded ( Nehemiah 2:20 ; 4:6, 9 ; 6:3–15 ):\nHow I can respond:\nFor help comparing Nehemiah’s experience to your life, you might study President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “ We Are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2009, 59–62), especially the last two sections . As you think about the work God has given you, you might study the “ Young Women Theme ” or the “ Aaronic Priesthood Quorum Theme ” (Gospel Library). Or you could look in a hymn like “ As Sisters in Zion ” ( Hymns , no. 309) or “ Ye Elders of Israel ” ( Hymns , no. 319).\nWhat do you think it means to have “a mind to work” in the service of the Savior? ( Nehemiah 4:6 ). What might it mean to have “the good hand of … God upon [you]” as you do His work? ( Nehemiah 2:8 ; see also Nehemiah 2:18 ; Ezra 7:6, 9, 27–28 ). How have you seen His hand in your efforts to serve Him?\n## I am blessed when I study the scriptures.\nNehemiah 8\nFor generations in captivity, the Jews had limited access to “the book of the law of Moses” ( Nehemiah 8:1 ). In Nehemiah 8 , Ezra read the law to the people. What do you find in this chapter that shows how Ezra and his people felt about God and His word? (see especially verses 1–12 ). What in your life shows how you feel about God and His word?\nSee also Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson (2014), 115–24 .\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nEzra 3:8–13 ; 6:16–22\nTo teach your children about the joy the Jews felt when their temple was rebuilt, you could show them a picture like the one below. Talk about why these people might be happy to be at the house of the Lord. You could also tell your children why the temple is a place of joy for you. How has the temple helped you feel closer to Heavenly Father and the Savior?\nAs you read Ezra 3:10–13 with your children, help them find words that show how the Jews felt when the temple was being rebuilt. When you get to the end of verse 13 , maybe you could shout for joy together. Help your children think of reasons to be joyful that the Lord has given us temples. How can we show that joy?\nConsider singing a song about the temple with your children, such as the second verse of “Welcome Home” (Gospel Library). After each line, you could pause to ask a child to share something he or she loves about the temple. You might also look at pictures of temples while you sing.\nNehemiah 2:17–20 ; 6:1–9\nShare with your children the story of Nehemiah (see Nehemiah 2:17–20 ; 6:1–9 ; or “ Nehemiah ” in Old Testament Stories , 173–74). As you read Nehemiah 2:20 , you and your children could “arise” and pretend to help build the walls of Jerusalem. Or your children might enjoy building a wall with blocks or other objects. As they do, you could help them think of important things Heavenly Father wants us to do.\nNehemiah\nAs you read Nehemiah 6:9 , invite your children to raise their hands when they hear you say “strengthen my hands.” Tell the children about a time when you felt God strengthen your hands to do His work.\nNehemiah 8:1–12\nRead aloud some phrases from Nehemiah 8:2–3, 5–6, 8–9, 12 that describe what the people did when they heard Ezra read the scriptures. As you read, your children could act out these phrases. Then you could share with each other how you feel when you read or hear the scriptures.\nAs you read together Nehemiah 8:8 , you could ask your children what helps them understand the scriptures. Show them how to use scripture study aids like the Guide to the Scriptures and Topics and Questions (Gospel Library). Invite your children to share something they have learned about the Savior from the scriptures.\nLook for eternal truth in the scriptures. “The scriptures … are filled with gospel truths, but sometimes it takes conscious effort to find them. As you are learning together from the scriptures, stop and ask those you teach what gospel truths they notice. Help them see how these truths relate to Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. Sometimes eternal truths are stated in the scriptures, and sometimes they are illustrated in the stories and lives of the people we read about. It can also be helpful to explore together the historical background of the verses you are reading, as well as the meaning of the verses and how they apply to us today” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 22 ).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The house of the Lord is a place of joy.\nEzra 3:8–13 ; 6:16–22\nTo teach your children about the joy the Jews felt when their temple was rebuilt, you could show them a picture like the one below.

  32-thoughts,Reading Poetry in the Old Testament,"","Isaiah 52:1,Psalm 29,Psalm 29:4,Amos 4:6,Proverbs 15:1,Isaiah 52:1,Proverbs 15:1","## Getting to Know Hebrew Poetry\nFirst, it might help you to know that Hebrew poetry in the Old Testament isn’t based on rhyme, like some other kinds of poetry. And although rhythm, wordplay, and repetition of sounds are common features of ancient Hebrew poetry, these things are typically lost in translation. One feature you will notice, however, is the repetition of thoughts or ideas, sometimes called “parallelism.” Here’s a simple example from Isaiah:\nPut on thy strength, O Zion;\nput on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem. ( Isaiah 52:1 )\nPsalm 29 has many parallel lines—for example:\nThe voice of the Lord is powerful;\nthe voice of the Lord is full of majesty. ( Psalm 29:4 )\nAnd here’s an instance where knowing that the second line is parallel to the first makes the passage easier to understand:\nI also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,\nand want of bread in all your places. ( Amos 4:6 )\nIn these examples, the poet repeated an idea with slight differences. This technique can emphasize the repeated idea and use the differences to more fully describe or develop it.\nIn other cases, the two parallel sentences use similar language to convey contrasting ideas, as in this example:\nA soft answer turneth away wrath:\nbut grievous words stir up anger. ( Proverbs 15:1 )\nThis kind of parallelism didn’t happen by accident. The writers did it intentionally. It helped them express spiritual feelings or truths with both power and beauty. So when you notice parallelism in Old Testament writing, ask yourself how it helps you understand the writer’s message. For example, what might Isaiah have been trying to say by relating “strength” with “beautiful garments” and “Zion” with “Jerusalem”? ( Isaiah 52:1 ). What can we infer about the phrase “a soft answer” if we know that “grievous words” is its opposite? ( Proverbs 15:1 ).\nHe Restoreth My Soul , by Walter Rane\n## Hebrew Poetry as a New Friend\nSome people compare reading poetry to meeting a new person. Reading Old Testament poetry, then, might be like meeting someone from a distant country and foreign culture who speaks a different language from us—and who happens to be over two thousand years old. This person will probably say things we don’t understand at first, but that doesn’t mean they have nothing valuable to say. We just need to spend time with them, trying to see things from their point of view. We might find that in our hearts, we actually understand each other quite well. And if we show patience and compassion, our new acquaintance can eventually become a dear friend.\nSo when you read a passage from Isaiah, for example, consider it your first introduction to a new acquaintance. Ask yourself, “What’s my general impression?” How does the passage make you feel—even if you don’t understand every word? Then read it again, several times if possible. Consider reading it out loud; some people find added meaning that way. Notice specific words Isaiah chose, especially words that paint a picture in your mind. How do those pictures make you feel? What do they suggest about Isaiah’s feelings? The more you study the words of these Old Testament writers, the more you will find that they deliberately chose their words and techniques to express a deep spiritual message.\nPoems can be wonderful friends because they help us understand our feelings and experiences. Old Testament poems are especially precious because they help us understand our most important feelings and experiences—the ones connected to our relationship with God.\nAs you study the poetry in the Old Testament, remember that scripture study is most valuable when it leads us to Jesus Christ. Look for symbols, imagery, and truths that build your faith in Him. Listen for inspiration from the Holy Ghost as you study."

As you read what Satan said about Job (see Job 1:9–11 ; 2:4–5 ), you might ask yourself, “Why do I remain faithful to God?” Why would it be dangerous to obey the Lord solely for the reason Satan suggested?\nWhat impresses you about Job’s responses to his trials? (see Job 1:20–22 ; 2:9–10 ).\nJob’s friends suggested that God was punishing him (see Job 4–5 ; 8 ; 11 ). What problems do you see with this idea? Read Job’s response in chapters 12–13 .

What do you know about God that helps you face challenges?\nJob 19\nSometimes we learn the most important truths during our most difficult times. Ponder the trials Job described in Job 19:1–22 and the truths he proclaimed in verses 23–27 . How do you know that your Redeemer lives? What difference does this knowledge make in your life?\nConsider singing or listening to a hymn about Jesus Christ, such as “ I Know That My Redeemer Lives ” ( Hymns , no. 136). What words from this hymn express your feelings about Him?\nSee also Doctrine and Covenants 121:1–12 ; 122 .\nJob 21–24\nIn Job 21–24 , you’ll read a debate between Job and his friends. At the heart of this debate was a question many people have asked: Why do righteous people sometimes suffer?\nAlthough we don’t have all the answers, in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we have some truths that can help us make sense of adversity and suffering. Below are latter-day scriptures that contain some of these truths. What do these scriptures teach you about Heavenly Father and His plan?\n2 Nephi 2:11–13\nMosiah 23:21–23 ; 24:10–16\nEther 12:27\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:3–5\nAbraham 3:22–26\nYou could also read President Spencer W. Kimball’s teachings about adversity in “ Tragedy or Destiny? ” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W.

Image courtesy of havenlight.com\nJob 38–40 ; 42\nFrustrated with his friends’ accusations (see Job 16:1–5 ; 19:1–3 ), Job repeatedly asked God why he had to suffer so much (see Job 19:6–7 ; 23:1–9 ; 31 ). The Lord did not give a clear reason in the book of Job. But He did teach an important message in chapters 38–40 . How would you summarize that message? For example, what do you learn from the Lord’s questions in Job 38:1–7, 18–24 ?\nYou’ll notice that the Lord spoke to Job about some of His creations and other mighty works (see Job 38–39 ). You might look at some of those creations (or pictures of them). How do these things help you think differently about God? about your trials? How did they change Job’s perspective? (see Job 42:1–6 ; see also Moses 1:8–10 ).\nHere are two general conference messages that can help change our perspective: Tamara W. Runia, “ Seeing God’s Family through the Overview Lens ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2023, 62–69); Russell M. Nelson, “ Think Celestial! ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2023, 117–20). In either message, look for something that you’ll want to remember the next time your trials seem overwhelming. How will you remind yourself of what you learned?\nBe creative. Learning doesn’t have to consist only of reading, thinking, and talking. Sometimes the most memorable learning comes in physically active ways. For example, when you read about how the Lord changed Job’s perspective in Job 38–40 , you might take a walk and look at some of the Lord’s creations, large and small. Or you might look at an object from different perspectives—from above, below, up close, far away, and so on.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## I can trust God in all circumstances.\nJob 1–3 ; 12–13\nThe opening chapters of Job emphasize, in a poetic way, Satan’s role as our adversary or accuser; they don’t describe an actual interaction between God and Satan.

What did Job know about God that enabled him to keep trusting? What do you know about God that helps you face challenges?\n## Jesus Christ is my Redeemer.\nJob 19\nSometimes we learn the most important truths during our most difficult times. Ponder the trials Job described in Job 19:1–22 and the truths he proclaimed in verses 23–27 . How do you know that your Redeemer lives? What difference does this knowledge make in your life?\nConsider singing or listening to a hymn about Jesus Christ, such as “ I Know That My Redeemer Lives ” ( Hymns , no. 136). What words from this hymn express your feelings about Him?\nSee also Doctrine and Covenants 121:1–12 ; 122 .\n## “When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.”\nJob 21–24\nIn Job 21–24 , you’ll read a debate between Job and his friends. At the heart of this debate was a question many people have asked: Why do righteous people sometimes suffer?\nAlthough we don’t have all the answers, in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we have some truths that can help us make sense of adversity and suffering. Below are latter-day scriptures that contain some of these truths. What do these scriptures teach you about Heavenly Father and His plan?\n2 Nephi 2:11–13\nMosiah 23:21–23 ; 24:10–16\nEther 12:27\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:3–5\nAbraham 3:22–26\nYou could also read President Spencer W. Kimball’s teachings about adversity in “ Tragedy or Destiny? ” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2011]), 11–21).\nBased on what you have studied, how might you answer a question like “Why does God allow righteous people to suffer?”\nCalm and Stars , by Yongsung Kim. Image courtesy of havenlight.com\n## God’s perspective is greater than mine.\nJob 38–40 ; 42\nFrustrated with his friends’ accusations (see Job 16:1–5 ; 19:1–3 ), Job repeatedly asked God why he had to suffer so much (see Job 19:6–7 ; 23:1–9 ; 31 ). The Lord did not give a clear reason in the book of Job. But He did teach an important message in chapters 38–40 . How would you summarize that message? For example, what do you learn from the Lord’s questions in Job 38:1–7, 18–24 ?\nYou’ll notice that the Lord spoke to Job about some of His creations and other mighty works (see Job 38–39 ). You might look at some of those creations (or pictures of them). How do these things help you think differently about God? about your trials? How did they change Job’s perspective? (see Job 42:1–6 ; see also Moses 1:8–10 ).\nHere are two general conference messages that can help change our perspective: Tamara W. Runia, “ Seeing God’s Family through the Overview Lens ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2023, 62–69); Russell M. Nelson, “ Think Celestial! ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2023, 117–20). In either message, look for something that you’ll want to remember the next time your trials seem overwhelming. How will you remind yourself of what you learned?\nBe creative. Learning doesn’t have to consist only of reading, thinking, and talking. Sometimes the most memorable learning comes in physically active ways. For example, when you read about how the Lord changed Job’s perspective in Job 38–40 , you might take a walk and look at some of the Lord’s creations, large and small. Or you might look at an object from different perspectives—from above, below, up close, far away, and so on.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nJob 1–2 ; 12 ; 19\nEncourage your children to tell you what they know about Job. If they need help, you could point them to Job 1:1, 13–22 ; 2:7–10 or to “ Job ” (in Old Testament Stories , 145–47). How did Job respond to challenges? (see Job 1:21 ; 2:10 ).\nJob\nJob was faithful in his challenges because of what he knew about the Lord. Maybe you and your children could look at pictures of Jesus Christ interacting with others (such as the one below or pictures in the Gospel Art Book ). Talk about what you know about Him and what He is like. Here are some verses that show what Job knew about the Lord: Job 12:10, 13, 16 ; 19:25–27 . Why is it valuable to know these things about Him?\nHe Healed Them All , by Michael Malm\nJob 14:14\nJob asked an important question in Job 14:14 . Maybe you and your children could take turns sharing how you would answer Job. You could look for ideas in Alma 11:42–44 , in the video “In a Coming Day” (Gospel Library), or in a song about the Resurrection, such as “ Did Jesus Really Live Again? ” ( Children’s Songbook , 64).\n#BECAUSEofHIM: An Easter Message of Hope and Triumph\nJob 16:1–5 ; 22:5\nWhen Job was sad, his friends said that God was punishing him because he had sinned (see Job 22:5 ). If we were Job’s friends, how would we try to help him? How can our words help others when they are sad? (see Job 16:5 ). Consider showing one or more of the pictures in this outline as you discuss these questions.\nConsider asking your children to list some qualities of a good friend and to name a friend who has these qualities. Then you could look at a picture of Jesus Christ. In what ways is Jesus a good friend to each of us? You might think of someone who’s going through a hard time. Plan how you will be a Christlike friend to them.\nJob 19:23–27\nAfter reading Job 19:23–27 , you and your children could talk about how you know that our Redeemer lives. You might work together to put your testimony (or drawings of the Savior) in a book (see verse 23 ).\nYou could also sing a song that testifies of the Savior, such as “ I Know That My Redeemer Lives ” ( Hymns , no. 136). Share phrases from the hymn that strengthen your faith in Him. Why is it important to know that Jesus Christ lives?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Faith in Jesus Christ will help me during hard times.\nJob 1–2 ; 12 ; 19\nEncourage your children to tell you what they know about Job.

( Psalm 71:24 ).\nSee also Alma 26 .\n“Come and hear, … and I will declare what [God] hath done for my soul” ( Psalm 66:16 ).\n## The Lord will help me in my time of need.\nPsalms 63 ; 69 ; 77–78\nSeveral psalms describe what it’s like to feel distant from God and desperately need His help (see Psalms 63:1, 8 ; 69:1–8, 18–21 ; 77:1–9 ). In Psalms 63 ; 69 ; 77–78 , what do you find that gave the psalmists reassurance?\nWhen you are distressed, how does it help you to “remember the works of the Lord” and His “wonders of old”? ( Psalm 77:11 ). Some of those wonders are described in Psalm 78 . As you read about them, ponder what helps you “set [your] hope in God” ( verse 7 ).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “Appendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path.”\nPsalms 51 ; 86:5, 13, 15\nTo help your children discover truths about repentance in Psalm 51 , you could draw a large heart. Then you could help your children write inside the heart bad things Satan tempts us to do. How do we get these things out of our hearts? Ask your children to find the word “heart” in Psalm 51:10, 17 . Talk about what these verses teach about repentance. Let your children erase the words inside the heart and write new words that describe the ways Jesus can change us when we repent.\nYou might want to help your children learn what it means to have “a broken and a contrite heart” ( Psalm 51:17 ). They could take turns breaking open something that has a hard shell, such as an egg or a nut. You could help them compare the shell to things that keep us from feeling Heavenly Father’s love. How can we open our heart to Him?\nYou could also look at a picture of the Savior together and ask your children what words they would use to describe Him. Invite them to find words that describe Him in Psalm 86:5, 13, 15 . Why is it important to know these things about Him?\nPsalm 61:2–3\nYour children might enjoy drawing pictures of the symbols in Psalm 61:2–3 . How is Jesus Christ like a high “rock” ( verse 2 ), “a shelter,” and “a strong tower”? ( verse 3 ).\n“Thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower” ( Psalm 61:3 ).\nPsalms 66:16 ; 77:11 ; 78:6–7\nAsk your children to share some of their favorite scripture stories (pictures from the Gospel Art Book might help). What do these stories teach us about the Lord? You could read together Psalm 66:16 and take turns answering the question “What has the Lord done for my soul”?\nAs you read Psalms 77:11 ; 78:6–7 together, you could share with each other how you try to “remember the works of the Lord” ( Psalm 77:11 ), including His works in your life. How does the sacrament help us “always remember”? ( Moroni 4:3 ; 5:2 ).\nPsalm 71:8\nAfter reading Psalm 71:8 with your children, invite them to draw a large mouth. Ask them to help you “fill” the mouth with pictures or words representing things we can tell others about Jesus Christ.\nYou could pass around a picture of Jesus Christ. The person holding the picture could say one thing they know about Him. How can we help other people know these things?\nChildren have much to share. “When children learn something new, they naturally want to share it with others. Encourage this desire by giving children opportunities to teach gospel principles to each other, their family members, and their friends. Also ask them to share with you their thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to the principles you are teaching. You will find that they have insights that are simple, pure, and powerful” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 32 ).\nPsalm 86:7\nMany of the psalms are like prayers to God. As you read Psalms with your children, you might show them things we can use to communicate with people who are far away, such as a phone or a letter. Then read Psalm 86:7 . How do we “call upon” Heavenly Father? How does He answer us?\nYou could sing together a song about prayer, such as “ A Child’s Prayer ” ( Children’s Songbook , 12–13; see also Susan H. Porter, “ Pray, He Is There ,” Liahona , May 2024, 77–79). Tell each other about times when God answered your prayers.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## When I make a wrong choice, Jesus can help me change.\nPsalms 51 ; 86:5, 13, 15\nTo help your children discover truths about repentance in Psalm 51 , you could draw a large heart.

Consider marking the word “wisdom” and related words, like “knowledge” and “understanding,” as you find them in Proverbs 1–4 ; 15–16 ; Ecclesiastes 1–3 ; 11–12 . How do these chapters affect the way you think about wisdom? Based on what you find, how would you describe the wisdom that “the Lord giveth”? ( Proverbs 2:6 ). What blessings come from God’s wisdom?\nSee also Matthew 7:24–27 ; 25:1–13 .\nHelp learners share what they’re learning. “Give learners opportunities to share with each other what they are learning about the Savior and His gospel. Doing this will help them internalize the truths they are taught and express them. It will also help them gain confidence in their ability to share truths in other settings” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 26 ). For example, you could invite learners to write down some references from Proverbs or Ecclesiastes where they found insights about God’s wisdom. Then invite learners to talk about what they learned.\nProverbs 1:7 ; 2:5 ; 3:7 ; 15:33 ; 16:6 ; 31:30 ; Ecclesiastes 12:13\nAnother theme found throughout Proverbs and Ecclesiastes is “the fear of the Lord.” Watch for this phrase as you read. What do you feel it means to fear the Lord? Look for insights in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “ Therefore They Hushed Their Fears ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2015, 46–49). How is fear of the Lord different from other kinds of fear?\nSee also Proverbs 8:13 .\nProverbs 3:5–7 ; 4\nHow would you try to persuade someone that it’s better to “trust in the Lord” than to “lean … unto [our] own understanding”? ( Proverbs 3:5 ). What comparisons or object lessons would you use? As you ponder Proverbs 3:5–7 , think of ways you might complete sentences like these: Trusting the Lord is like … Leaning on our own understanding is like …\nWhy is it unwise to lean on our own understanding? How have you discovered that the Lord is trustworthy?\nEven so, we might find it difficult to trust the Lord at times. Why is that? Elder Gerrit W. Gong suggests some reasons, along with helpful counsel, in “ Trust Again ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2021, 97–99). What stories or teachings do you find in this message that might help someone restore their trust in the Lord?\nBoth Proverbs 3:6 and Proverbs 4 compare life to a “path” or a “way.” What do you think it means to let the Lord “direct [your] paths”? ( Proverbs 3:6 ). What do you find in chapter 4 that helps you “ponder the path of [your] feet”? ( verse 26 ). For example, what do verses 11–12 and 18–19 teach about the blessings of following the right path? What do verses 26–27 mean to you?\nSee also 2 Nephi 31:18–21 ; “ Lord, I Would Follow Thee ,” Hymns , no. 220.\nProverbs 15 ; 16:24–32\nSome of the ideas in Proverbs 15–16 might inspire you to improve the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. For example, think about specific times when “a soft answer” helped to “[turn] away wrath” ( Proverbs 15:1 ).\nYou might also think of times when the Savior exemplified the teachings in Proverbs 15:1–4, 18 (see Mark 12:13–17 ; John 8:1–11 ). How can you follow His example as you interact with others?\nHow might the counsel in Proverbs 15 ; 16:24–32 apply to today’s digital communication? See if you can find a verse in these chapters that you could rephrase as advice about interacting over social media or through text.\nSee also Neil L.

You might try summarizing in your own words what each of these verses says about virtuous women. Which of these traits can you emulate?\nEcclesiastes 1–3 ; 12\nWhy is it valuable for you to remember that much in this world, as Ecclesiastes 1–2 asserts, is “vanity” (or temporary and often unimportant)?

Then invite learners to talk about what they learned.\n## “Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord.”\nProverbs 1:7 ; 2:5 ; 3:7 ; 15:33 ; 16:6 ; 31:30 ; Ecclesiastes 12:13\nAnother theme found throughout Proverbs and Ecclesiastes is “the fear of the Lord.” Watch for this phrase as you read. What do you feel it means to fear the Lord? Look for insights in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “ Therefore They Hushed Their Fears ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2015, 46–49). How is fear of the Lord different from other kinds of fear?\nSee also Proverbs 8:13 .\n## “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.”\nProverbs 3:5–7 ; 4\nHow would you try to persuade someone that it’s better to “trust in the Lord” than to “lean … unto [our] own understanding”? ( Proverbs 3:5 ). What comparisons or object lessons would you use? As you ponder Proverbs 3:5–7 , think of ways you might complete sentences like these: Trusting the Lord is like … Leaning on our own understanding is like …\nWhy is it unwise to lean on our own understanding? How have you discovered that the Lord is trustworthy?\nEven so, we might find it difficult to trust the Lord at times. Why is that? Elder Gerrit W. Gong suggests some reasons, along with helpful counsel, in “ Trust Again ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2021, 97–99). What stories or teachings do you find in this message that might help someone restore their trust in the Lord?\nBoth Proverbs 3:6 and Proverbs 4 compare life to a “path” or a “way.” What do you think it means to let the Lord “direct [your] paths”? ( Proverbs 3:6 ). What do you find in chapter 4 that helps you “ponder the path of [your] feet”? ( verse 26 ). For example, what do verses 11–12 and 18–19 teach about the blessings of following the right path? What do verses 26–27 mean to you?\nSee also 2 Nephi 31:18–21 ; “ Lord, I Would Follow Thee ,” Hymns , no. 220.\n## “A soft answer turneth away wrath.”\nProverbs 15 ; 16:24–32\nSome of the ideas in Proverbs 15–16 might inspire you to improve the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. For example, think about specific times when “a soft answer” helped to “[turn] away wrath” ( Proverbs 15:1 ).\nYou might also think of times when the Savior exemplified the teachings in Proverbs 15:1–4, 18 (see Mark 12:13–17 ; John 8:1–11 ). How can you follow His example as you interact with others?\nHow might the counsel in Proverbs 15 ; 16:24–32 apply to today’s digital communication? See if you can find a verse in these chapters that you could rephrase as advice about interacting over social media or through text.\nSee also Neil L.

II , by Louise Parker\n## “A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.”\nProverbs 31:10–31\nProverbs 31:10–31 describes “a virtuous woman,” or a woman of great spiritual strength, capability, and influence. You might try summarizing in your own words what each of these verses says about virtuous women. Which of these traits can you emulate?\n## Mortal life is temporary.\nEcclesiastes 1–3 ; 12\nWhy is it valuable for you to remember that much in this world, as Ecclesiastes 1–2 asserts, is “vanity” (or temporary and often unimportant)? What do you find in Ecclesiastes 12 that gives life eternal value?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nProverbs 1:7 ; 2:5 ; 15:33 ; 16:6 ; Ecclesiastes 12:13\nTo help your children understand passages about fearing God, you could substitute the word “fear” with words like reverence , love , or obedience (see also Hebrews 12:28 ). How does this affect the way we think about these verses? How do we show that we fear the Lord?\nProverbs 3:5–7\nYou and your children could make up actions to go with Proverbs 3:5–7 , like making a heart with your hands, leaning to one side, walking in place, and pointing to your eyes. How can we show that we trust Jesus Christ with all our hearts?\nTo show what it means to “lean not unto thine own understanding” ( Proverbs 3:5 ), consider inviting your children to lean against something sturdy and stable, like a wall. Then they could try leaning against something that is not sturdy, like a broom. Or they could try leaning a stick or a pencil against objects of varying sturdiness, such as a book or a piece of paper. Why is it important to “trust in the Lord” ( verse 5 ) and not our “own understanding”?\nLearning to Trust the Lord , by Kathleen Peterson\nProverbs 15:1, 18\nPerhaps you and your children can think of situations when you or they might feel angry. Read Proverbs 15:1 together, and help your children apply this verse to the situations they thought of. Maybe they could practice some “soft answers.” A song about kindness, such as “ Love Is Spoken Here ” ( Children’s Songbook , 190–91), could reinforce this principle.\nTo learn what it means to be “slow to anger” ( Proverbs 15:18 ), you and your children could share times when you (or someone you know) felt angry but chose to be kind. Help your children think of things we can be quick to if we are “slow to anger.” For example, we can be quick to think about Jesus, to ask Heavenly Father for help, to think of a Primary song, or, if possible, to walk away.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## To “fear God” means to love and obey Him.\nProverbs 1:7 ; 2:5 ; 15:33 ; 16:6 ; Ecclesiastes 12:13\nTo help your children understand passages about fearing God, you could substitute the word “fear” with words like reverence , love , or obedience (see also Hebrews 12:28 ).

  37-thoughts,Prophets and Prophecy,"","Isaiah 65:17,Isaiah 11:9,Isaiah 2:4,1 Nephi 19:24,verse 23,Isaiah 40:3,Revelation 19:10,Exodus 15:20,Judges 4,Genesis 25:21–23","## Prophets Communicate God’s Will\nProphets and prophecy play a major role throughout the Old Testament. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saw visions and spoke with heavenly messengers. Moses talked to God face to face and communicated His will to the children of Israel. The first and second books of Kings recount the memorable works and messages of the prophets Elijah and Elisha. The Old Testament also speaks of prophetesses like Miriam and Deborah, along with other women blessed with the spirit of prophecy, such as Rebekah and Hannah. And even though the Psalms weren’t written by formal prophets, they too are filled with the spirit of prophecy, especially as they point toward the coming of the Messiah.\nNone of this comes as a surprise to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In fact, the restored gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that prophets are not just interesting historical figures but an essential part of God’s plan. Although some might see prophets as unique to Old Testament times, we see them as something we have in common with Old Testament times.\nBut reading a chapter from Isaiah or Ezekiel might feel different from reading a general conference message from the current President of the Church. Sometimes it’s hard to see that ancient prophets had something to say to us. After all, the world we live in today is quite different from the world where they preached and prophesied. And the fact that we do have a living prophet could raise a question: Why is it worth the effort—and it does take effort—to read the words of ancient prophets?\nFulness of Times , by Greg Olsen\n## Ancient Prophets Have Something to Say to Us\nFor the most part, people today aren’t the primary audience of the Old Testament prophets. Those prophets had immediate concerns they were addressing in their time and place—just as our latter-day prophets address our immediate concerns today.\nAt the same time, prophets can also see beyond immediate concerns. They teach eternal truths, relevant to any time and place. Blessed with revelation, they see the wider perspective of God’s work. For example, Isaiah warned people in his time about their sins. He also wrote about the deliverance of Israelites who would live 200 years in the future. At the same time, he taught about the deliverance that all God’s people seek. And he wrote prophecies that, even today, are still waiting to be fulfilled—like promises of “a new earth” ( Isaiah 65:17 ) that will be “full of the knowledge of the Lord” ( Isaiah 11:9 ), where the lost tribes of Israel will be gathered and where “the nations” will not “learn war any more” ( Isaiah 2:4 ). Part of the joy and inspiration that comes from reading the words of Old Testament prophets like Isaiah is realizing that we play a role in the glorious day they envisioned.\nSo when you read ancient prophecies, it can help to learn about the context in which they were written—but you should also see yourself in them, or “liken them unto [yourself]” ( 1 Nephi 19:24 ; see also verse 23 ). Sometimes that means recognizing Babylon as a symbol of sin and pride, not just as an ancient city. It could mean understanding Israel as God’s people in any time and place. Or it might mean seeing Zion as the latter-day cause that God’s people embrace, instead of seeing it as just another word for Jerusalem.\nWe can compare the scriptures to our lives because we understand that a prophecy can be fulfilled in multiple ways. A good example is the prophecy in Isaiah 40:3 : “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.” To the captive Jews in Babylon, this statement might have referred to the Lord providing a way out of captivity and back into Jerusalem. To Matthew, Mark, and Luke, this prophecy referred to John the Baptist, who prepared the way for the Savior’s mortal ministry. And Joseph Smith received revelation that this prophecy is still being fulfilled today in preparation for Christ’s millennial ministry. In ways that we’re still coming to understand, ancient prophets did speak to us. And they taught many precious, eternal truths that are just as relevant to us as they were to ancient Israel.\n## Ancient Prophets Testified of Jesus Christ\nPerhaps even more important than seeing yourself in Old Testament prophecies is seeing Jesus Christ in them. If you look for Him, you will find Him, even if He’s not mentioned by name. It might help to keep in mind that the God of the Old Testament, the Lord Jehovah, is Jesus Christ. Anytime the prophets describe what the Lord is doing or what He will do, they are speaking of the Savior.\nThe Lord Appearing unto Abraham , by Keith Larson\nYou will also find references to an Anointed One, a Redeemer, and a future King from David’s line. These are all prophecies about Jesus Christ. More generally, you will read about deliverance, forgiveness, redemption, and restoration. With the Savior in your mind and heart, these prophecies will naturally point you to the Son of God. After all, the best way to understand prophecy is to have “the spirit of prophecy,” which John tells us is “the testimony of Jesus” ( Revelation 19:10 )."

Now Babylon is ancient history. So why is Isaiah’s message to Babylon, in Isaiah 13–14 , important to us today? Because Babylon symbolizes pride, greed, and sin, things that still surround us today. Think about this symbolism as you read Isaiah 13:1–11, 19–22 ; 14:1–20 . You might consider questions like these:\nWhat similarities do you see between the pride of the Babylonian king and the pride of Satan? (see Isaiah 14:4–20 ; Moses 4:1–4 ). What warnings do you find for yourself in these verses?\nHow does the Savior provide “rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear”? ( Isaiah 14:3 ).\n“He will swallow up death in victory” ( Isaiah 25:8 ).\nIsaiah 22:22–23 ; 24:21–23 ; 25:6–8 ; 26:19 ; 28:16\nThe teachings of Isaiah often refer to the Savior’s mission, including His atoning sacrifice, Resurrection, and Second Coming.

What other passages do you find that remind you of the Savior?\nGive learners opportunities to bear testimony of Jesus Christ. “To be a teacher of Jesus Christ’s gospel means to help others understand and rely on His teachings, redeeming power, and perfect love” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 8 ). One simple way to do that every time you teach is to ask a question like “What did you find in the scriptures this week that taught you something about the Savior?” Then let learners share their experiences and strengthen each other’s faith.\nIsaiah 24:1–12 ; 28:1–8 ; 29:7–13 ; 30:8–14\nIn His mercy, the Lord sent Isaiah to warn the covenant people that they were straying from Him. See if you can find the spiritual warning signs of this in Isaiah 24:5 ; 29:13 ; 30:8–12 . Why are these attitudes and actions spiritually dangerous?\nTo warn about the consequences of turning away from the Lord, Isaiah used some memorable comparisons. As you study them, ask yourself how turning away from the Lord is like:\nA sad, empty earth ( Isaiah 24:1–12 ).\nDrunkenness ( Isaiah 28:7–8 ).\nHunger and thirst ( Isaiah 29:7–10 ).\nA broken wall or vessel ( Isaiah 30:13–14 ).\nWhy is it important to you to stay close to the Lord?\nIsaiah 29 ; 30:18–26 ; 35\nHave you ever lost something that you thought you would never find again? Or maybe something broke, and you worried that it could never be repaired. When we turn away from the Lord, Satan wants us to think that we can never return or be healed. However, Isaiah described some of the marvelous things the Lord will do to help us return to Him. What do you learn from Isaiah 29:13–24 ; 30:18–26 ; 35 about the Lord, His love, and His power?

Isaiah 29 contains several passages that have parallels with events of the Restoration.

Now Babylon is ancient history. So why is Isaiah’s message to Babylon, in Isaiah 13–14 , important to us today? Because Babylon symbolizes pride, greed, and sin, things that still surround us today. Think about this symbolism as you read Isaiah 13:1–11, 19–22 ; 14:1–20 . You might consider questions like these:\nWhat similarities do you see between the pride of the Babylonian king and the pride of Satan? (see Isaiah 14:4–20 ; Moses 4:1–4 ). What warnings do you find for yourself in these verses?\nHow does the Savior provide “rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear”? ( Isaiah 14:3 ).\n“He will swallow up death in victory” ( Isaiah 25:8 ).\n## Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nIsaiah 22:22–23 ; 24:21–23 ; 25:6–8 ; 26:19 ; 28:16\nThe teachings of Isaiah often refer to the Savior’s mission, including His atoning sacrifice, Resurrection, and Second Coming. What aspects of His mission come to mind as you read these verses: Isaiah 22:22–23 ; 24:21–23 ; 25:6–8 ; 26:19 ; 28:16 ? What other passages do you find that remind you of the Savior?\nGive learners opportunities to bear testimony of Jesus Christ. “To be a teacher of Jesus Christ’s gospel means to help others understand and rely on His teachings, redeeming power, and perfect love” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 8 ). One simple way to do that every time you teach is to ask a question like “What did you find in the scriptures this week that taught you something about the Savior?” Then let learners share their experiences and strengthen each other’s faith.\n## Turning away from the Lord brings spiritual danger.\nIsaiah 24:1–12 ; 28:1–8 ; 29:7–13 ; 30:8–14\nIn His mercy, the Lord sent Isaiah to warn the covenant people that they were straying from Him.

As you read Isaiah 40–49 , look for passages that might have provided comfort and hope. For each passage you find, ponder and record what the Lord might be saying to you in these verses.

Sometimes we can understand the Old Testament better if we supplement our study with verses from the Book of Mormon. For example, the Book of Mormon prophets Nephi and Jacob had access to the writings of Isaiah on the plates of brass (see 1 Nephi 19:22–23 ), and they used these prophecies to teach about the Savior. To learn how Nephi and Jacob likened Isaiah 48–49 to their people, see 1 Nephi 22 . That may help you liken these chapters to your own life.\nBy obeying the Lord, we can have “peace … as a river” ( Isaiah 48:18 ).\nIsaiah 40–49\nThroughout Isaiah 40–49 the Lord speaks of His “servant” and His “witnesses.” These words can refer to Jesus Christ (see Isaiah 42:1–7 ), to the house of Israel (see Isaiah 45:4 ), and to King Cyrus, who allowed the Jewish people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (see Isaiah 44:26–28 ; 45:1–4 ). You might also consider how the passages apply to you as a servant and a witness of the Lord. For example, ponder questions like these:\nIsaiah 40:1–3, 9–11 ; 43:9–12 . In what sense are you a witness of Jesus Christ? What are the “good tidings” that you can share as His witness? You might imagine that you have been called to the witness stand in a court trial. In this trial, Jesus Christ has been charged with making the claim recorded in Isaiah 43:11 . What testimony could you give in support of Jesus’s claim? What evidence from your life would you present?\nIsaiah 41:8–13 ; 42:6 ; 44:21 . What has the Lord called you to do? Consider Church callings as well as other opportunities to serve Him.

What do you find in Isaiah’s message that gives you hope? A chart like this one might help you study:\nWhat I learn about God (see, for example, Isaiah 50:2, 5–9 ; 51:3–8, 15–16 ; 52:3, 9–10 )\nMessages of hope (see, for example, Isaiah 50:9 ; 51:3–5, 11–12, 22–23 ; 52:9–10 )\nWhat I can do to make hope a reality (see, for example, Isaiah 50:10 ; 51:1–2, 6–9 ; 52:1–3, 9–11 )\nSee also Mosiah 12:20–24 ; 15:13–18 ; 3 Nephi 20:29–46 ; Doctrine and Covenants 113:7–10 ; Russell M. Nelson, “ Embrace the Future with Faith ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 73–76.\nBecause of Love , by Angela Johnson\nHelp learners come unto Jesus Christ. “Nothing you do as a teacher will bless learners more than helping them know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and feel Their love” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 8 ). As you prepare to teach Isaiah 50–57 to others, consider how you can help them see connections between Israel’s challenges, Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ, and receiving divine help with their own struggles.\nIsaiah 53\nFew chapters in scripture describe Jesus Christ’s redemptive mission more beautifully than Isaiah 53 . Consider activities like these to better understand and apply these powerful teachings:\nPonder or discuss how stories and movies often depict heroes who rescue people. Contrast those depictions with the descriptions of the Savior in Isaiah 53 .\nAfter reading each verse, pause to contemplate what the Savior suffered—the “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “transgressions” He bore—for all people and specifically for you. You might replace words like “we” and “our” with “I” and “my” as you read. What feelings or thoughts do these verses inspire in you?\nConsider watching the video “My Kingdom Is Not of This World” (Gospel Library), and ponder how the prophecies in Isaiah 53 were fulfilled. What are some of the griefs and sorrows the Savior carries for you?\nMy Kingdom Is Not of This World\nFind pictures of the events surrounding the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 56–60 ). You could then find phrases in Isaiah 53 that describe the events in the pictures. What do these teachings inspire you to do?\nSee also “ Behold the Great Redeemer Die ,” Hymns , no. 191.\nIsaiah 54 ; 57:15–19\nWe all have times when we feel distant from the Lord because of our sins or weaknesses. Some have even given up hope that He will ever forgive them. Isaiah 54 and 57 are great chapters to read for reassurance and encouragement during such times. Particularly in Isaiah 54:4–10 ; 57:15–19 , what words teach you how the Savior feels about you? What difference does it make in your life to know these things about Him?\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:\n“It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem. It matters not how scarlet our sins, how deep our bitterness, how lonely, abandoned, or broken our hearts may be. Even those who are without hope, who live in despair, who have betrayed trust, surrendered their integrity, or turned away from God can be rebuilt. …\n“The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God’s indescribable glory” (“ He Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 102).\nSee also Patrick Kearon, “ God’s Intent Is to Bring You Home ,” Liahona , May 2024, 87–89.\nIsaiah 55–56\nFor generations, Israel had been identified as God’s covenant people. However, God’s plan has always included more than just one nation, for “every one that thirsteth” is invited to “come … to the waters” ( Isaiah 55:1 ). Keep this in mind as you read Isaiah 55 and 56 , and ponder what it means to be God’s people. What is God’s message to those who feel “utterly separated” from Him? ( Isaiah 56:3 ). Consider marking verses that describe attitudes and actions of those who “take hold of my covenant” (see Isaiah 56:4–7 ).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## The future is bright for the Lord’s people.\nIsaiah 50–52\nEven though the Israelites spent many years in captivity—and even though that captivity was a result of their own poor choices—the Lord wanted them to look to the future with hope. What do you find in Isaiah’s message that gives you hope? A chart like this one might help you study:\nWhat I learn about God (see, for example, Isaiah 50:2, 5–9 ; 51:3–8, 15–16 ; 52:3, 9–10 )\nMessages of hope (see, for example, Isaiah 50:9 ; 51:3–5, 11–12, 22–23 ; 52:9–10 )\nWhat I can do to make hope a reality (see, for example, Isaiah 50:10 ; 51:1–2, 6–9 ; 52:1–3, 9–11 )\nSee also Mosiah 12:20–24 ; 15:13–18 ; 3 Nephi 20:29–46 ; Doctrine and Covenants 113:7–10 ; Russell M. Nelson, “ Embrace the Future with Faith ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 73–76.\nBecause of Love , by Angela Johnson\nHelp learners come unto Jesus Christ. “Nothing you do as a teacher will bless learners more than helping them know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and feel Their love” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 8 ). As you prepare to teach Isaiah 50–57 to others, consider how you can help them see connections between Israel’s challenges, Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ, and receiving divine help with their own struggles.\n## Jesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.\nIsaiah 53\nFew chapters in scripture describe Jesus Christ’s redemptive mission more beautifully than Isaiah 53 . Consider activities like these to better understand and apply these powerful teachings:\nPonder or discuss how stories and movies often depict heroes who rescue people. Contrast those depictions with the descriptions of the Savior in Isaiah 53 .\nAfter reading each verse, pause to contemplate what the Savior suffered—the “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “transgressions” He bore—for all people and specifically for you. You might replace words like “we” and “our” with “I” and “my” as you read. What feelings or thoughts do these verses inspire in you?\nConsider watching the video “My Kingdom Is Not of This World” (Gospel Library), and ponder how the prophecies in Isaiah 53 were fulfilled. What are some of the griefs and sorrows the Savior carries for you?\nMy Kingdom Is Not of This World\nFind pictures of the events surrounding the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 56–60 ). You could then find phrases in Isaiah 53 that describe the events in the pictures. What do these teachings inspire you to do?\nSee also “ Behold the Great Redeemer Die ,” Hymns , no. 191.\n## Jesus Christ wants me to return to Him.\nIsaiah 54 ; 57:15–19\nWe all have times when we feel distant from the Lord because of our sins or weaknesses. Some have even given up hope that He will ever forgive them. Isaiah 54 and 57 are great chapters to read for reassurance and encouragement during such times. Particularly in Isaiah 54:4–10 ; 57:15–19 , what words teach you how the Savior feels about you? What difference does it make in your life to know these things about Him?\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:\n“It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem. It matters not how scarlet our sins, how deep our bitterness, how lonely, abandoned, or broken our hearts may be.

After doing so, you could talk about what it means to awake, stand up, and put on strength spiritually. What is the Lord asking us to do in these verses?\nYour children could also read Isaiah 51:1, 4, 7 and identify who the Lord is speaking to and what He wants them to do. What does it mean to “hearken unto” the Lord? How can we show the Lord that we “hearken unto” Him?\nIsaiah 53:3–9\nYou and your children could look at several pictures showing the suffering and death of Jesus Christ (see, for example, Gospel Art Book , nos. 56 , 57 , 58 ). Then you could read together Isaiah 53:3–6, 9 and look for words that describe what is happening in the pictures. Help your children understand that Isaiah shared these truths hundreds of years before they happened. Why would it be important for people to know these things so many years in advance? (see Alma 39:15–19 ).\nAfter reading from Isaiah 53:4 , “He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” your children could try to lift a heavy object (or pretend to lift one). Talk about how “grief” and “sorrow” or sadness can feel heavy and hard to carry. Why did Jesus carry our “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “iniquities” or sins? (see also Alma 7:11–12 ).\nIsaiah 55:6\nTo teach your children about Isaiah 55:6 , you could hide a picture of Jesus somewhere in the room. You could invite your children to find the picture and name one way they can “seek … the Lord while he may be found.” A song like “ Seek the Lord Early ” ( Children’s Songbook , 108) could give them ideas. Then you could let one of the children hide the picture and repeat the activity.\nIsaiah 55:8–9\nAfter reading Isaiah 55:9 , it might be fun for your children to stand on a stool and talk about how things look different when you are “higher.” Or they could draw a picture of what Isaiah 55:9 means to them. You could then discuss some of the Lord’s ways that are higher than our ways. For example, what is His way of treating sinners? (see Mark 2:15–17 ). What is His way of leading others? (see Matthew 20:25–28 ). Share with your children how you have learned to trust the Lord’s higher ways and thoughts.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The Lord invites me to “put on [my] strength.”\nIsaiah 51–52\nIt might be fun for your children to discover phrases like “awake,” “stand up,” and “put on thy strength” in Isaiah 51:9, 17 ; 52:1–2, 9 and then act out those phrases.

What do you find in these verses that teaches something about prophets of God? You could also look in Jeremiah 7:1–7 ; 20:8–9 and a hymn like “ We Listen to a Prophet’s Voice ” ( Hymns , no. 22).\nYou might also want to teach your friend about today’s living prophet. Is there anything in these verses that might help? For example, what do prophets in our day “root out” or “pull down”? What do they “build” and “plant”? ( Jeremiah 1:10 ). How have you come to know that our living prophet is called of God?\nSee also Articles of Faith 1:6, 9 ; “Why Do We Have Prophets?” (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nWhy Do We Have Prophets?\nJeremiah 1:5\nWhat did Jeremiah learn about himself in Jeremiah 1:5 ? As a newly called prophet, why would that information be important for him to know?\nMuch of what Jeremiah learned about himself in Jeremiah 1:5 is also true about you. God also knew you before you were born and prepared you for specific responsibilities. To learn more about your life before you were born, read Alma 13:1–4 ; Doctrine and Covenants 138:53–56 ; and Abraham 3:22–23 . You might make a list of truths you discover. Why is this information important for you to know?\nTo learn about how these truths affected the life of Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt, study his message “ You Can Gather Israel! ” ( Liahona , May 2021, 61–63). How does knowing about your premortal life affect the way you live your mortal life?\nHere is what President Russell M. Nelson said about your premortal life:\n“Your Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth. You were chosen not for your bodily characteristics but for your spiritual attributes, such as bravery, courage, integrity of heart, a thirst for truth, a hunger for wisdom, and a desire to serve others.\n“You developed some of these attributes premortally. Others you can develop here on earth as you persistently seek them” (“ Decisions for Eternity ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2013, 107).\nThink of some situations you might face in which it would be important to remember these truths about your premortal life. What can you do to remind yourself of these truths?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “ Decisions for Eternity ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2013, 106–9; Topics and Questions, “ Foreordination ,” “ Premortal Life ,” Gospel Library.\nIn Jeremiah 2:13 , the Lord compared the people’s spiritual state to “broken cisterns” and compared Himself to the “fountain of living waters.”\nJeremiah 2 ; 7\nIn the dry region where the Israelites lived, people stored precious water in underground reservoirs called cisterns. What do you think the “broken cisterns” mentioned in Jeremiah 2:13 might symbolize? Why would receiving water from a fountain be better than relying on a cistern? What does it mean to forsake “the fountain of living waters”? As you read Jeremiah 2 and 7 , notice how the people were forsaking the Lord’s living waters (see, for example, Jeremiah 2:26–28 ; 7:2–11 ). Why is “living water” a good symbol for what the Savior gives you? Think about how you are receiving living water.\nJeremiah 7 is addressed to people who were entering “the Lord’s house … to worship the Lord,” but their actions didn’t match their outward devotion (see verses 2–11 ). What messages do you feel the Lord might have for you in verses 21–23 ?\nUse object lessons. The Lord’s prophets often compare spiritual truths to familiar objects. Consider doing the same as you learn and teach the gospel. For example, to visualize Jeremiah 2:13 , you could put water in a cracked or broken container or drink from a drinking fountain. How is Jesus like a “fountain of living waters”? ( Jeremiah 2:13 ). How do we drink from His living water?\nJeremiah 3:14–18 ; 16:14–21\nIn Jeremiah 16:14–15 , Jeremiah compared the gathering of Israel in the latter days with the Exodus of Israel from Egypt. In your opinion, why would the gathering be even more important to God’s people than the Exodus?\nWhat do Jeremiah 3:14–18 ; 16:14–21 suggest about how the gathering happens?\nIn his message “ Hope of Israel ,” President Russell M. Nelson, like Jeremiah, taught that the gathering of Israel “is the most important thing taking place on earth today” (worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018, Gospel Library). Read or listen to his message, and see if you can discover (a) how President Nelson defines the gathering of Israel, (b) how he describes its importance, and (c) how you can be part of the gathering.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Prophets are called to speak God’s word.\nJeremiah 1:4–19 ; 7:1–7 ; 20:8–9\nImagine you’re talking to a friend who has never heard of prophets, and you decide to explain the concept using Jeremiah’s call to be a prophet in Jeremiah 1:4–19 . What do you find in these verses that teaches something about prophets of God? You could also look in Jeremiah 7:1–7 ; 20:8–9 and a hymn like “ We Listen to a Prophet’s Voice ” ( Hymns , no. 22).\nYou might also want to teach your friend about today’s living prophet. Is there anything in these verses that might help? For example, what do prophets in our day “root out” or “pull down”? What do they “build” and “plant”? ( Jeremiah 1:10 ). How have you come to know that our living prophet is called of God?\nSee also Articles of Faith 1:6, 9 ; “Why Do We Have Prophets?” (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nWhy Do We Have Prophets?\n## God knew me before I was born.\nJeremiah 1:5\nWhat did Jeremiah learn about himself in Jeremiah 1:5 ? As a newly called prophet, why would that information be important for him to know?\nMuch of what Jeremiah learned about himself in Jeremiah 1:5 is also true about you. God also knew you before you were born and prepared you for specific responsibilities. To learn more about your life before you were born, read Alma 13:1–4 ; Doctrine and Covenants 138:53–56 ; and Abraham 3:22–23 . You might make a list of truths you discover. Why is this information important for you to know?\nTo learn about how these truths affected the life of Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt, study his message “ You Can Gather Israel! ” ( Liahona , May 2021, 61–63). How does knowing about your premortal life affect the way you live your mortal life?\nHere is what President Russell M. Nelson said about your premortal life:\n“Your Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth. You were chosen not for your bodily characteristics but for your spiritual attributes, such as bravery, courage, integrity of heart, a thirst for truth, a hunger for wisdom, and a desire to serve others.\n“You developed some of these attributes premortally. Others you can develop here on earth as you persistently seek them” (“ Decisions for Eternity ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2013, 107).\nThink of some situations you might face in which it would be important to remember these truths about your premortal life. What can you do to remind yourself of these truths?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “ Decisions for Eternity ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2013, 106–9; Topics and Questions, “ Foreordination ,” “ Premortal Life ,” Gospel Library.\nIn Jeremiah 2:13 , the Lord compared the people’s spiritual state to “broken cisterns” and compared Himself to the “fountain of living waters.”\n## “They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters.”\nJeremiah 2 ; 7\nIn the dry region where the Israelites lived, people stored precious water in underground reservoirs called cisterns. What do you think the “broken cisterns” mentioned in Jeremiah 2:13 might symbolize? Why would receiving water from a fountain be better than relying on a cistern? What does it mean to forsake “the fountain of living waters”? As you read Jeremiah 2 and 7 , notice how the people were forsaking the Lord’s living waters (see, for example, Jeremiah 2:26–28 ; 7:2–11 ). Why is “living water” a good symbol for what the Savior gives you? Think about how you are receiving living water.\nJeremiah 7 is addressed to people who were entering “the Lord’s house … to worship the Lord,” but their actions didn’t match their outward devotion (see verses 2–11 ). What messages do you feel the Lord might have for you in verses 21–23 ?\nUse object lessons. The Lord’s prophets often compare spiritual truths to familiar objects. Consider doing the same as you learn and teach the gospel. For example, to visualize Jeremiah 2:13 , you could put water in a cracked or broken container or drink from a drinking fountain. How is Jesus like a “fountain of living waters”? ( Jeremiah 2:13 ). How do we drink from His living water?\n## The Lord will gather His people.\nJeremiah 3:14–18 ; 16:14–21\nIn Jeremiah 16:14–15 , Jeremiah compared the gathering of Israel in the latter days with the Exodus of Israel from Egypt. In your opinion, why would the gathering be even more important to God’s people than the Exodus?\nWhat do Jeremiah 3:14–18 ; 16:14–21 suggest about how the gathering happens?\nIn his message “ Hope of Israel ,” President Russell M.

Ask your children if they know where they lived before they were born. You could also sing together a song that teaches about our premortal life, such as “ I Lived in Heaven ” ( Children’s Songbook , 4).\nIf your children would like to learn more, you could help them find “ Premortal Life ” in the Guide to the Scriptures. They could look for answers to “who,” “when,” and “what” questions about the premortal life.\nJeremiah 1:4–19\nConsider showing pictures of the living prophet or prophets from the scriptures (you can find some in Church magazines , the Gospel Art Book , and Come, Follow Me ). Ask your children what they know about these prophets.\nTo teach about what prophets do, you might select some helpful verses from Jeremiah 1 , such as verses 5, 7, 10 , and 19 . Your children could each pick one of the verses, read it, and share something they learn about prophets.\nJeremiah 16:14–16\nWhile you read Jeremiah 16:16 , your children could pretend to “fish” or “hunt” for objects around the room. President Russell M. Nelson has compared the fishers and hunters in this verse to missionaries (see “ The Gathering of Scattered Israel ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2006, 81). What do missionaries do? How can we help “fish” and “hunt” for scattered Israel? (see “A Message for Children from President Russell M. Nelson” [video], ChurchofJesusChrist.org ).\nVideo: A Message for Children from President Russell M. Nelson\nJeremiah 18:1–6\nTo explore these verses, you might discuss or show how pottery is made (see the picture at the end of this outline). What message does the Lord have for us in Jeremiah 18:1–6 ? What does it mean to be clay in the Lord’s hands? (see also Isaiah 64:8 ).

As you read these chapters, consider what these titles suggest about what it means to be a leader.\nWho are the “sheep” the Lord wants you to feed? What do you find in Ezekiel 34 that could help someone preparing to serve a mission, raising children, or fulfilling a ministering assignment? How can you follow the Savior’s example as our shepherd? (see verses 11–31 ).\nYou might also ponder the symbolism you find in this chapter. What might the “good pasture” and “good fold” represent in verse 14 ? What’s the difference between a sheep who is “lost” and one who is “driven away”? ( verse 16 ). What other symbols do you find?\nSee also John 21:15–17 ; Gerrit W.

In response, the Lord taught them about repentance and forgiveness. These questions might help you ponder what He taught:\nWhat do you think it means to “trust to [your] own righteousness”? (see Ezekiel 33:12–13 ).\nWhat would you say to someone who feels that the people described in Ezekiel 33:12–19 are not being treated fairly?

What additional insights do you find in Ezekiel 36:26–27 and Alma 7:14–16 ?\nEzekiel 37\nThe gathering of Israel is portrayed in Ezekiel 37 through two symbols. As you read about the first one—dead bones being restored to life (see verses 1–14 )—ponder what it suggests to you about gathering Israel on both sides of the veil (see also Ezekiel 36:24–30 ). Consider questions like these:\nWhat is the Lord trying to accomplish through the gathering of Israel?\nHow is He accomplishing it?\nYou could ask yourself these same questions as you read about the second symbol, in verses 15–28 . This symbol involves two sticks, which many scholars interpret as wooden writing boards joined by a hinge. The stick of Judah can represent the Bible (since much of the Bible was written by Judah’s descendants), and the stick of Joseph can represent the Book of Mormon (since Lehi’s family were descendants of Joseph of Egypt).

What impresses you about the waters described in verses 1–12 ? (see also Revelation 22:1 ). What might these waters symbolize? What could the trees described in verse 12 represent?\nWhat does Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “ Family History and Temple Work: Sealing and Healing ” add to your understanding? (see Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 47–48). Ponder how you have found spiritual life and healing because of the temple.\n## The Lord invites me to feed His sheep.\nEzekiel 3 ; 34\nIn Ezekiel 3 and 34 , the Lord refers to leaders of His people as watchmen and shepherds. As you read these chapters, consider what these titles suggest about what it means to be a leader.\nWho are the “sheep” the Lord wants you to feed? What do you find in Ezekiel 34 that could help someone preparing to serve a mission, raising children, or fulfilling a ministering assignment? How can you follow the Savior’s example as our shepherd? (see verses 11–31 ).\nYou might also ponder the symbolism you find in this chapter. What might the “good pasture” and “good fold” represent in verse 14 ? What’s the difference between a sheep who is “lost” and one who is “driven away”? ( verse 16 ). What other symbols do you find?\nSee also John 21:15–17 ; Gerrit W. Gong, “ Ministering ,” Liahona , May 2023, 16–19.\n## The Lord wants to forgive.\nEzekiel 33:10–19\n“If our … sins be upon us,” the captive Israelites wondered, “how should we then live?” ( Ezekiel 33:10 ). In response, the Lord taught them about repentance and forgiveness. These questions might help you ponder what He taught:\nWhat do you think it means to “trust to [your] own righteousness”? (see Ezekiel 33:12–13 ).\nWhat would you say to someone who feels that the people described in Ezekiel 33:12–19 are not being treated fairly? (see also Matthew 21:28–31 ; Luke 18:9–14 ).\nWhat do you find in these verses that helps you understand what it means to repent? What additional insights do you find in Ezekiel 36:26–27 and Alma 7:14–16 ?\n## The Lord is gathering His people and giving them new life.\nEzekiel 37\nThe gathering of Israel is portrayed in Ezekiel 37 through two symbols. As you read about the first one—dead bones being restored to life (see verses 1–14 )—ponder what it suggests to you about gathering Israel on both sides of the veil (see also Ezekiel 36:24–30 ). Consider questions like these:\nWhat is the Lord trying to accomplish through the gathering of Israel?\nHow is He accomplishing it?\nYou could ask yourself these same questions as you read about the second symbol, in verses 15–28 . This symbol involves two sticks, which many scholars interpret as wooden writing boards joined by a hinge. The stick of Judah can represent the Bible (since much of the Bible was written by Judah’s descendants), and the stick of Joseph can represent the Book of Mormon (since Lehi’s family were descendants of Joseph of Egypt).

Ponder how you have found spiritual life and healing because of the temple.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nEzekiel 3:17 ; 33:1–5\nYoung children might enjoy doing actions that go with Ezekiel 3:17 . For example, they could point to their eyes, ears, and mouth when you read the words “watchman,” “hear,” and “mouth.” They might also like going on a hike—outdoors or just around the room. As they walk, warn them about things on the trail, like rivers to jump over, branches to duck under, or animals to avoid (real or pretend). This could lead to a conversation about how the Lord’s prophet warns us of dangers we cannot see.\nHere’s another way to illustrate Ezekiel 3:17 ; 33:1–5 . One of your children could pretend to be a “watchman” by looking out a window and telling everyone else what is happening outside. You could also watch the video “Watchman on the Tower” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). How is our living prophet like a watchman for us?\nWatchman on the Tower\nThe Prophet Ezekiel , by Lyle Beddes\nEzekiel 37:15–23\nAfter reading Ezekiel 37:15–23 together, you and your children could find two sticks and write on one For Judah (Bible) and on the other For Joseph (Book of Mormon) . You could then share stories or scriptures from the Bible and Book of Mormon that help you feel closer to the Savior and become “[His] people” ( verse 23 ). Why is it good to have both of these two books of scripture?\nDon’t try to cover everything. You may not be able to explore every truth in Ezekiel with your children. Prayerfully consider what they need to understand, and seek spiritual guidance to determine what to focus on. (See Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 17 .)\nEzekiel 47:1–12\nEzekiel 47 describes Ezekiel’s vision of water flowing from the temple and healing the Dead Sea—a sea so salty that fish and plants cannot live in it. Maybe your children could each draw one or two objects from the vision, like a temple, a river, a desert, the Dead Sea, a multitude of fish, or a fruitful tree. Then, as you read verses 1–12 together, they could share their drawing when that object is mentioned. What blessings came from the river in this vision? Help the children see how these blessings are like the blessings the Savior offers those who keep temple covenants. The video “And the River Will Grow” (Gospel Library) can help.\nAnd the River Will Grow\nYou could also sing together a song that describes temple blessings, such as “ Families Can Be Together Forever ” ( Children’s Songbook , 188).

Illustration by Deb Minnard, licensed from goodsalt.com\n## Devotion to God must be felt inwardly, not just expressed outwardly.\nHosea 6:4–7 ; Joel 2:12–13\nThe people in Hosea’s day were offering animal sacrifices, but they were breaking more important commandments. What do you think it means that the Lord “desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings”? ( Hosea 6:6 ). What do you think it means for righteousness to be like a cloud or like dew? (see Hosea 6:4 ). What should our righteousness be like? (see Isaiah 48:18 ; 1 Nephi 2:9–10 ).\nYou could also read Matthew 9:10–13 ; 12:1–8 to see how the Savior used Hosea 6:6 during His ministry. How do these passages help you understand Hosea’s words?\nWhen reading Joel 2:12–13 , it might help to know that rending or tearing one’s clothing was an outward sign of mourning or remorse. How is rending our hearts different from rending our garments?\n## “I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.”\nJoel 2\nWhat similarities do you see between our day and the day Joel foresaw? (see especially Joel 2:1–2, 11, 18–32 ). What impresses you about the blessings the Lord promised in verses 18–32 ? Why might these blessings be especially valuable today?\nIt might be interesting to read what Moroni said about Joel 2 when he visited Joseph Smith in 1823 (see Joseph Smith—History 1:41 ). How do you feel the prophecies in Joel 2:28–32 are being fulfilled in our day? (see also Acts 2:1–21 ). What do you think it means that the Lord would “pour out [His] spirit upon all flesh”? ( Joel 2:28 ).\nYou might ponder these words from President Russell M. Nelson: “In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost” (“ Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 96). Why is revelation essential to your spiritual survival?\nWhat can you do if you feel like you aren’t receiving that outpouring? Here are some examples that might help. What did the people in these scriptures do to receive an outpouring of the Lord’s Spirit?\nMosiah 4:1–3, 19–20 ; 18:7–11\nHelaman 6:34–36\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:37–41\nAs you read these words from Elder David A. Bednar, ponder what it means to you to feel an outpouring of the Holy Ghost in your daily life:\n“We often make it hard on ourselves to receive personal revelation. By that I mean the covenant promise is that as we honor our covenants, we may always have the Holy Ghost to be our constant companion. But we talk about it and we treat it as if hearing the voice of the Lord through His Spirit is the rare event. … [The Spirit] ought to be with us all of the time. Not every nanosecond, but if a person is doing his or her best—you don’t have to be perfect—but if you and I are doing our best and we’re not committing serious transgression, then we can count on the Holy Ghost guiding us. …\n“… We seem to believe that the Holy Ghost is dramatic and big and sudden, when it’s still and small and incremental over time” (“ Elder David A. Bednar Discussion ” [evening with a General Authority, Feb. 7, 2020], broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).\nSee also Gary E. Stevenson, “ Promptings of the Spirit ,” Liahona , Nov. 2023, 42–45; “Enemy Territory” (video), Gospel Library.\nEnemy Territory\nCreate a spiritual environment. “What have you observed that contributes to a spiritual environment for learning the gospel? What detracts from it? … Think about the setting where you most often teach [or learn]. How do you feel when you are there? How can you more effectively invite the Spirit to be present there?” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 7 ).\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nHosea 2:19–20\nIn the book of Hosea, the Lord compared His covenants with His people to a marriage. To learn from this comparison, you and your children could look at a picture of a bride and groom and talk about how Heavenly Father wants a husband and wife to treat each other. Help your children find words in Hosea 2:19–20 that describe how the Lord feels about us. How can we show the Lord that we love Him and will be faithful to Him?\nHosea 10:12\nHosea 10:12 refers to sowing, reaping, time, and rain to invite us to seek the Lord. As you read this verse, what creative ideas come to mind that could inspire the children to seek Him? For example, maybe your children could draw a clock and write down ways they can seek the Lord at different times throughout the day. A song like “Anytime, Anywhere” (Gospel Library) could help you teach that it is always a good time to seek the Lord.\nOr your children could do simple actions that go with the verse, such as pretending to plant seeds, pick vegetables, or stand in the rain. Help your children compare planting a seed and reaping good food to living righteously and receiving the Lord’s blessings. Then you could tell each other about the blessings the Lord has rained upon you as you have tried to seek Him.\nHosea 13:4, 14\nTo emphasize the truth in Hosea 13:4 that there is no Savior except Jesus Christ, you could show your children pictures of several people, including Jesus. Your children could take turns pointing to the person who has the power to save us from sin and death. Share your testimony of Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\nYour children could look for words in Hosea 13:4, 14 that describe Jesus Christ. What do these words teach us about Him? Consider helping your children use the Guide to the Scriptures to find other scriptures that teach that Jesus is our Savior and Redeemer. Share with each other how you feel about Jesus Christ.\nJoel 2:28–29\nMaybe you could help your children understand Joel 2:28–29 by letting them pour a liquid and then contrasting it with a drip or a trickle. What could it mean for the Spirit to be “poured out” upon us?\nAs you read Joel 2:28–29 together, you might invite your children to insert each other’s names in place of the phrases “your sons” and “your daughters.” Then help them search scriptures like John 14:16 ; Moroni 10:5 ; Doctrine and Covenants 42:17 to find out how the Spirit can help them.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## I can faithfully keep my covenants.\nHosea 2:19–20\nIn the book of Hosea, the Lord compared His covenants with His people to a marriage.

You could also sing a song like “ Follow the Prophet ” ( Children’s Songbook , 110–11). Share with each other why you choose to follow God’s prophet.\nHelp children memorize scriptures. Elder Richard G. Scott shared: “To memorize a scripture is to forge a new friendship. It is like discovering a new individual who can help in time of need, give inspiration and comfort, and be a source of motivation for needed change” (“ The Power of Scripture ,” Ensign , Nov. 2011, 6).

As the Lord told Habakkuk, “Wait for it; because it will surely come” ( Habakkuk 2:3 ).\n## “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth.”\nZephaniah\nAs you read Zephaniah’s prophecies, notice the attitudes and behaviors that led to destruction—see especially Zephaniah 1:4–6, 12 ; 2:8, 10, 15 ; 3:1–4 . Then look for the characteristics of the people God would preserve—see Zephaniah 2:1–3 ; 3:12–13, 18–19 . What message do you feel the Lord has for you in these verses?\n## The Lord will rejoice with His people in Zion.\nZephaniah 3:14–20\nAfter reading Zephaniah 3:14–20 , see how many ways you can complete this sentence: “Be glad and rejoice with all the heart” because … Why is it important to you to know about these reasons to rejoice? You might compare these verses to the experiences described in 3 Nephi 17 and ponder how Jesus Christ feels about His people—including you.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nMicah 5:2\nYour children may not know that it was a prophecy by Micah that helped the Wise Men find the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.

Perhaps your children could pick a phrase from verse 6 and draw a picture of it. They could show it to each other and guess what phrase each drawing represents. When we spend time on things other than what the Lord wants, how is that like eating but not being filled? You might talk with each other about how you can make time for the things that are important to the Lord.\nYou could also read verse 8 to your children and invite them to pretend to “go up to the mountain,” “bring wood,” and “build the house [of the Lord].” Your children could make a list of things they do in a typical day, including things the Lord has asked them to do. Ask your children to “consider [their] ways” by circling what the Lord might say are the most important things on their list.\nHome-centered teaching. President Russell M. Nelson has taught that the home should be the “center of gospel learning” (“ Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 113).

An angel gave him clean clothing. You could help your children discover important truths by reading together Zechariah 3:1–7 and talking about what the dirty clothing and clean clothing might represent. How do we become clean from our sins, even after we are baptized? How does our baptismal covenant help us “walk in [the Lord’s] ways”?\nYou and your children could look at a picture of a baptism, like the one in this outline. Why do we wear white at our baptism?

For each item on the list, ponder what might make it a “polluted” offering or a “pure” offering ( Malachi 1:7, 11 ).\nMalachi 3:8–12\nImagine you have a friend who just found out that you pay tithing. “Why do you do that?” your friend asks.

Maybe your children could draw pictures that remind them of His love.\nEngage children in gospel discussions. If you are teaching younger children, you may need to think of creative ways to involve them in gospel discussions. For example, your children could pass around a ball; when they are holding the ball, they could share one reason they know Jesus loves them.\nMalachi 3:8–12\nHow will you help your children learn about tithing? You could ask them to count 10 small objects, such as the coins on this week’s activity page. Then they could separate one of the objects from the rest—this is how much we give to the Lord as tithing. According to Malachi 3:8–12 , why does the Lord want us to pay tithing? (see also “ Malachi the Prophet ” in Old Testament Stories , 171–72; “First Things First!” [video], Gospel Library).\nMalachi the Prophet\nFirst Things First!\nAs you read Malachi 3:10 together, you could invite your children to stand by a window when you read the phrase “windows of heaven.” Or you could pour water into a cup until it overflows to illustrate the phrase “there shall not be room enough to receive it.” Tell the children about the blessings God has given you as you pay tithing. Your children could draw pictures representing these blessings and hang them on or near a window in your home.\nMalachi 4:5–6\nIn Malachi 4:5–6 , your children could look for answers to the following questions about Malachi’s prophecy: Who did the Lord promise to send? When did He say this person would come? What did the Lord say that this person would do? Why would this person need to come? Where was this prophecy fulfilled? (see Doctrine and Covenants 110:13–16 ).\nTo find out how the promise in Malachi 4:5 was fulfilled, you can also review “Joseph and Oliver Receive Priesthood Keys” in Doctrine and Covenants Stories , 26–30.

Maybe your children could draw pictures that remind them of His love.\nEngage children in gospel discussions. If you are teaching younger children, you may need to think of creative ways to involve them in gospel discussions. For example, your children could pass around a ball; when they are holding the ball, they could share one reason they know Jesus loves them.\n## The Lord will bless me as I pay tithing.\nMalachi 3:8–12\nHow will you help your children learn about tithing?

Centuries before the Savior was born, Old Testament prophets also felt joy as they spoke of the coming Messiah. Read some of the following passages, and think about why they would have been precious to people who looked forward to the Savior’s mission: Psalm 35:9 ; Isaiah 25:8–9 ; 44:21–24 ; 51:11 ; Zephaniah 3:14–20 ; Moses 5:5–11 .

Maybe you could talk about how a Christmas star, lights, or a gift reminds us of the Savior. Then you could look in one or more of the following scriptures for something that could symbolize Jesus Christ: Genesis 22:8 ; Numbers 24:17 ; Psalms 23:1 ; 27:1 . Maybe your children could hold up a picture or decoration that goes with each verse as they read it. How is Jesus like a lamb, star, shepherd, or light? Consider singing a Christmas song together, like “ Stars Were Gleaming ” ( Children’s Songbook , 37).\nYour children could also look at the picture at the end of this outline as you read Isaiah 9:6 to them. Ask your children to point to the baby Jesus when they hear the phrase “a child is born.” Share your testimony that prophets in the Old Testament knew that Jesus would be born.\nAs you prepare to study the life of Jesus Christ in the New Testament next year, consider reviewing with your children what they have learned about Him this year in the Old Testament. You might review the outlines in this resource and any personal study notes to help you remember what you’ve learned. Younger children might benefit from looking through Old Testament Stories or the pictures in Come, Follow Me . What prophecies or stories stood out? What have we learned about the Savior?\nIsraelite families had traditions, such as the Passover and other feasts, that were meant to point their hearts and minds to the Lord (see Exodus 12 ). What traditions do you and your children have at Christmastime that help you focus on Jesus Christ? What traditions do you know about from your family history? You might consider discussing with your children some traditions you want to start. Some ideas might include serving someone in need, choosing something you will offer as a “gift” to the Savior, inviting a friend to watch the First Presidency’s Christmas devotional with you ( broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ), writing your own Christmas song, or finding a creative way to share the message of Christ’s birth.\nIn the home, learning and living are inseparable. “The gospel takes on immediate relevance in the home. There the people with whom you are learning the gospel are the people with whom you will live it—every day. In fact, much of the time, living the gospel is how we learn the gospel. So as you learn and teach the gospel at home, look for ways to connect what you are learning with what you are doing. In your home, let the gospel be something you strive to live by, not just something you talk about” ( Teaching in the Savior’s Way , 31 ).\nIllustration of the Nativity, by Ethan Brown\nHow can you help your children feel the reverence and joy of Christ’s birth? You might watch the video “The Christ Child” (Gospel Library) or read together Matthew 1:18–25 ; 2:1–12 ; Luke 1:26–38 ; 2:1–20 . Each child could choose a person from the video or scripture account and share how that person felt about the Savior. Then you could share with each other your own feelings about Him.\nThe Christ Child\nPerhaps you and your children could talk about gifts you’ve given or received over the years that have brought joy. Then you could read Isaiah 25:9 together and talk about why you rejoice that Heavenly Father sent us a Savior. To help your children better understand Jesus Christ’s role as our Savior, invite them to read Isaiah 25:8–9 ; 53:3–5 ; and Hosea 13:14 . What do these scriptures teach us about how the Lord saves us?\nYou could also sing a Christmas song together, such as “ Away in a Manger ” ( Children’s Songbook , 42–43) or “ O Little Town of Bethlehem ” ( Hymns , no. 208). Help your children find phrases in the song that help them know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love them.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The Old Testament teaches me about Jesus.\nYou and your children might have some Christmas decorations you can use to start a conversation about Jesus Christ.

Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenant by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] should enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” ( 2 Nephi 31:17 ).\nHere are some resources that can help you: 2 Nephi 31 ; special issue of the Friend magazine about baptism; Topics and Questions, “ Baptism ,” Gospel Library.\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child. Help them understand that faith is something that can grow stronger and stronger throughout life. What are some things your child can do to develop stronger faith in Christ before they are baptized?\nWhen your child makes a wrong choice, speak joyfully about the gift of repentance. And when you make a wrong choice, share the joy that comes when you repent of your sins each day. Testify that because Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, we can repent daily, be forgiven, and receive the power to change. When your child seeks your forgiveness, forgive freely and joyfully.\nTell your child about your baptism. Show pictures and share memories. Talk about how you felt, how keeping your baptismal covenant has helped you come to know Jesus Christ better, and how your covenants continue to bless your life. Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like these: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something they promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (See Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 .)\nTalk about how being confirmed and becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has blessed you. For example, how have you come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you have served others and as others have served you? Help your child think of ways to serve and strengthen others as a member of the Church. Also help them experience and recognize the joy that comes from service.\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell them about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have. Invite your child to share how they feel. Note the variety of ways the Spirit can speak to people, including ways He speaks to you personally. Help your child recognize and share with you moments when they may be experiencing the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nWatch together a few of the videos in the Gospel Library collection titled “ Hear Him! ” Talk together about the different ways the Lord’s servants hear His voice. Invite your child to draw a picture or make a video about how they hear the Savior’s voice.\nMake the sacrament a sacred and joyful event in your family. Share with your child how you focus on Jesus Christ during the sacrament. Help your child make a plan to show that the sacrament is sacred to them. For example, listening to the words of the sacrament prayers can remind us of our baptismal covenant.\nMany issues of the Friend magazine include articles, stories, and activities to help children prepare for baptism and confirmation. Let your child choose some to read and enjoy with you. (See also the collection “ Preparing for Baptism ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library.)\n## Priesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nThe priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “All Church members who keep their covenants—women, men, and children—are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families” ( General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 3.6 , Gospel Library). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see General Handbook , 2.2 ).\nWhen men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. All of Heavenly Father’s children—His sons and His daughters—will be blessed as they come to better understand His priesthood.\nWe receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. “Worthy male Church members receive priesthood authority through priesthood conferral and ordination to priesthood offices” ( General Handbook , 3.4 ). Those who hold priesthood offices can be authorized by someone who holds priesthood keys to perform priesthood ordinances.\nTo learn more about the priesthood, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Spiritual Treasures ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79; Russell M. Nelson, “ The Price of Priesthood Power ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 66–69; “ Priesthood Principles ,” chapter 3 in General Handbook .\nMake priesthood ordinances a consistent part of your family life. For example, help your child prepare spiritually for the sacrament each week. Encourage your child to seek priesthood blessings when they are sick or need comfort or direction. Make it a habit to point out ways the Lord is blessing your family through His power.\nAs you read the scriptures together, watch for opportunities to discuss how God blesses people through His power. Share your own experiences when God has blessed you through His priesthood. For examples of blessings we receive from God through the priesthood, see General Handbook , 3.2 , 3.5 .\nTeach your child that after baptism, they can receive God’s power by keeping the baptismal covenant. Review together President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ Spiritual Treasures ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79). Tell your child how priesthood ordinances have brought God’s power into your life. For a list of some of the ways we are blessed by God’s power, see General Handbook , 3.5 .\nDiscuss the question “What is a servant of the Lord like?” Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:36–42 , and look for answers. Whenever you notice your child (or someone else) applying one of the principles or attributes in these verses, point it out.\nWhen you or your child uses keys to unlock a door or start a car, take a moment to compare those keys to the keys that priesthood leaders hold. (For a definition of priesthood keys, see General Handbook , 3.4.1 ). What do priesthood keys “unlock” or “start” for us? See also Gary E. Stevenson, “ Where Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood? ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 29–32; “Where Are the Keys?” (video), Gospel Library.\nWhere Are the Keys?\n## Being Baptized and Confirmed for Ancestors\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In the house of the Lord, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including people who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year your child turns 12, they are old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors (see also 1 Corinthians 15:29 ).\nGo to the house of the Lord as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the temple recommend questions together. You can find them on pages 36–37 of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices . Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together Malachi 4:6 . Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on FamilySearch.org . Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “ Temple ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “ Preparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org.)\n## Receiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel to us from Heavenly Father and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching them the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Topics and Questions, “ Patriarchal Blessings ,” Gospel Library.\nShare with your child your experience receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how He continues to guide you through this blessing. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nReview together Elder Randall K. Bennett’s message “ Your Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father ” and Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita’s message “ When to Receive Your Patriarchal Blessing ” ( Liahona , May 2023, 42–43, 88–90). Share with each other what you learn from these messages about why Heavenly Father wants us to receive a patriarchal blessing. To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see General Handbook , 18.17 .\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to ChurchofJesusChrist.org , click Tools at the top right corner of the screen, and select Patriarchal Blessing .\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and share them with your child.\n## Receiving the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” ( Doctrine and Covenants 95:8 ). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the house of the Lord. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there. Look for opportunities to go to the temple with your child to perform baptisms and confirmations for their ancestors.\nExplore temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org together. Read articles like “ About the Temple Endowment ” and “ Prepare for the House of the Lord .” Let your child ask any questions they have about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “ Prepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “ Home-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation ”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how they are keeping the baptismal covenant described in Mosiah 18:10, 13 (see also verses 8–9 , which describe the fruits of that covenant). Also help your child notice how the Lord is blessing them. Build your child’s confidence in their ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ. You could use General Handbook , 27.2 , to review the covenants we make in the temple. If you have received the endowment, tell your children about how the temple garment helps you remember your covenants with Jesus Christ (see “Sacred Temple Clothing” [video], Gospel Library; Anette J. Dennis, “ Put Ye On the Lord Jesus Christ ,” Liahona , May 2024, 10–13).\nSacred Temple Clothing\n## Serving a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to become a missionary long before you go on a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“ Becoming a Missionary ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2005, 45–46). The experiences your child has becoming a missionary will bless them eternally, not just for the period of time they may serve a mission.\nTo learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Preaching the Gospel of Peace ,” Liahona , May 2022, 6–7; Gary E. Stevenson, “ Love, Share, Invite ,” Liahona , May 2022, 84–87; “ Adjusting to Missionary Life ,” Gospel Library.\nModel how to share the gospel in natural ways. Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive from the Savior’s restored gospel and as a member of His Church. Invite others to join your family in Church- and family-related activities.\nLook for opportunities for your family to interact with missionaries. Invite them to teach your friends, or offer to let them teach people in your home. Ask the missionaries about the experiences they’re having and how missionary service is helping them draw closer to Jesus Christ. Also ask what they did (or wish they had done) to prepare to be missionaries.\nIf you served a mission, talk openly and often about your experiences. Or invite friends or family members who served missions to talk about theirs. You could also talk about ways you’ve shared the gospel with others throughout your life. Help your child think of ways they can share the gospel.\nGive your child opportunities to teach your family principles of the gospel. Your child could also practice sharing their beliefs with others. For example, you could discuss questions like “How would we introduce the Book of Mormon to someone who has never heard of it?” or “How would we describe the need for the Savior to someone who is not a Christian?” (See Ahmad S. Corbitt, “ Do You Know Why I as a Christian Believe in Jesus Christ? ,” Liahona , May 2023, 119–21.)\nHelp your child become comfortable talking to people. What are some good ways to start a conversation? Encourage your child to learn how to listen to what others say, understand what is in their hearts, and share truths of the gospel that could bless their lives.\nLook for opportunities for your child to learn about other cultures and faiths. Help them recognize and respect the good and true principles in others’ beliefs.\n## Receiving the Sealing Ordinance\nIn the temple, a husband and wife can be married for eternity. This occurs in an ordinance called “the temple sealing.” Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your daughter or son, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help them prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nRead together “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” (Gospel Library). What does this proclamation teach about happiness in family life and about successful marriages? With your child, choose one of the principles listed in the proclamation to study. You could look up scriptures related to that principle in the Guide to the Scriptures . You could also set goals to apply that principle more fully in your family. As you work on your goals, discuss together the effect that living that principle has on family life.\nWith your child, read President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “ In Praise of Those Who Save ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 77–80). When you get to the section titled “ A Society of Disposables ,” you might look for things in your home that are disposable and other things that are not. Talk about how you treat things differently when you want them to last a long time. What does this suggest about how we should treat marriage and family relationships? What else do we learn from President Uchtdorf’s message about how the Savior can help us build strong marriages and families?\nBe open with your child about the things you and your spouse are learning about having a Christ-centered eternal marriage and the ways you’re trying to improve. If you and your spouse have been sealed in the temple, show your child by example how you strive to keep your covenants with the Lord. Tell your child how you strive to make Heavenly Father and the Savior the center of your relationship and how They are helping you (see also Ulisses Soares, “ In Partnership with the Lord ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 42–45).\nWhen family decisions need to be made, hold family councils and discussions. Make sure that all family members’ opinions are heard and valued. Use these discussions as an opportunity to model healthy communication and kindness in family relationships, even when not everyone sees things the same way. (See M. Russell Ballard, “ Family Councils ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 63–65.)\nWhen there is disagreement or conflict in the family, demonstrate patience and compassion. Help your child see how handling conflict in Christlike ways can help them prepare for a happy marriage. Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–42 , and talk about how the principles in these verses can be applied to marriage."

He said that we can enter the kingdom of God if we have faith, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end (see 3 Nephi 11:31–40 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 20:29 ). The activities below can help you teach the children that these principles and ordinances will help us draw closer to the Savior throughout our lives.\nTo learn more about the doctrine of Christ, see 2 Nephi 31 .\nGive the children pictures that represent faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and confirmation (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 1 , 111 , 103 , and 105 ).

Help the children understand how each of these principles and ordinances helps us become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nHow can you help the children understand that faith, repentance, baptism, and confirmation are not one-time events but influence our spiritual growth throughout our lives? You could show them a picture of a seed and a large tree (or draw these things on the board). Help them think of things that help the seed grow into a large tree, such as water, soil, and sunlight. Help them see that these are like the things we do to grow closer to God throughout our lives—building our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting each day, living our baptismal covenant, partaking of the sacrament, and receiving the Holy Ghost.\nShare with the children the story about the firecracker from Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “ How Can Repenting Help Me Feel Happy? ” ( Friend , Dec. 2017, 12–13, or Liahona , Dec. 2017, 70–71; see also the video “Repentance: A Joyful Choice” [Gospel Library]).

Invite them to draw a picture of themselves on their baptism day.\nPreparing for baptism means much more than preparing for an event. It means preparing to make a covenant and then keeping that covenant for a lifetime. Ponder how you can help the children understand the covenant they will make with Heavenly Father when they are baptized, which includes the promises He makes to them and the promises they make to Him.\nExplain that a covenant is a promise between a person and Heavenly Father. As we strive to keep our promises to God, God promises to bless us. Write on the board My Promises to God and God’s Promises to Me .

Share an experience when you have witnessed members of the Church serving in these ways.\nAlma at the Waters of Mormon\nWhen we are baptized and confirmed, Heavenly Father promises that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]” ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:77 ). This wonderful gift from God is called the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nTo learn more about the gift of the Holy Ghost, see Gary E.

Nelson: “Taking the Savior’s name upon us includes declaring and witnessing to others—through our actions and our words—that Jesus is the Christ” (“ The Correct Name of the Church ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 88).\nInvite the children to color “ Jesus Introduced the Sacrament to the Nephites ” in Scripture Stories Coloring Book: Book of Mormon (2019), 26. Ask them to point to what the people are thinking about in the picture. Read to the children portions of 3 Nephi 18:1–12 or “ Jesus Shares the Sacrament ,” in Book of Mormon Stories . What can we do to remember Jesus Christ during the sacrament?\nAsk the children to tell you some things they should always remember to do, such as tying their shoes or washing their hands before they eat. Why is it important to remember these things? Read Moroni 4:3 to the children, and invite them to listen for what we promise to always remember when we take the sacrament.

We make these covenants when we receive priesthood ordinances such as baptism (see General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 3.5 , 3.6 , Gospel Library).

To give them some ideas, you could show the video “Blessings of the Priesthood” (Gospel Library). Consider listing these blessings on the board. Why are these blessings important to us? Testify that these blessings come to us because of Jesus Christ and His priesthood power.\nBlessings of the Priesthood\nHelp the children find pictures that illustrate how God uses His power to bless us. For example, they could find a picture of the world He created for us, examples of healing the sick, and sacred ordinances He has provided for us (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 3 , 46 , 104 , 105 , 107 , 120 ). Share why you are grateful for the priesthood and the blessings it brings. Help the children think of experiences when they were blessed by God’s priesthood power.\nOne of the main ways we receive the blessings of God’s power in our lives is through priesthood ordinances (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:20 ). To help the children learn this truth, you could list the following scriptures on the board: 3 Nephi 11:21–26, 33 (baptism); Moroni 2 (confirmation); Moroni 4–5 (sacrament). The children could each choose one of these passages and identify the ordinance it describes. Invite the children to share how they have been personally blessed by receiving priesthood ordinances.\nHelp the children understand that they will receive power from God as they are baptized and keep their baptismal covenant. Ask the children how this power could help them.\nWhenever a person is set apart for a calling or assigned to help in God’s work, she or he can exercise delegated priesthood authority. In addition, worthy male Church members can have the priesthood conferred on them and be ordained to a priesthood office. The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by leaders who hold priesthood keys, such as the stake president, the bishop, and quorum presidents. Priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood in doing the work of the Lord.\nRead with the children Mark 3:14–15 , and show them a picture of the event described there (such as Gospel Art Book , no. 38 ). Ask the children if they have ever seen someone be set apart for a calling or ordained to a priesthood office (or tell them about experiences you have had). How is that similar to what the Savior did with His Apostles? Help the children list on the board callings or priesthood offices that can be given to members of the Church, such as a teacher or leader in an organization. Next to each calling or office, you could write what someone with that calling or office has the authority to do. Tell the children how being set apart by someone with the direction of priesthood keys has helped you serve.\nInvite the children to think of something that you need a key for, such as a car or a door. What happens if you don’t have the key? Read together Doctrine and Covenants 65:2 , and share your testimony about the importance of having priesthood keys.

  55-appendix-c,For Primary—Instructions for Singing Time and the Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation,"","","## Guidelines for the Sacrament Meeting Presentation\nWith the direction of the bishop, the children’s sacrament meeting presentation is normally held during the fourth quarter of the year. As the Primary presidency and music leader, work with the counselor in the bishopric who oversees Primary to plan the presentation.\nThe presentation should allow the children to present what they and their families have learned from the Old Testament at home and in Primary, including the Primary songs they have sung during the year. As you plan the presentation, think of ways it can help the congregation focus on the Savior and His teachings.\nUnits with small numbers of children may consider ways in which family members can participate with their children. A member of the bishopric may conclude the meeting with brief remarks.\nAs you prepare the presentation, remember the following guidelines:\nPractices should not take unnecessary time away from Primary classes or families.\nVisuals, costumes, and media presentations are not appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSee General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 12.2.1.2 , Gospel Library.\n## Instructions for Singing Time\n5 minutes (Primary presidency): Opening prayer, scripture or article of faith, and one talk\n20 minutes (music leader): Singing time\nThe Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. A list of songs that reinforce these principles is included in this guide.\nAs you teach songs to the children, invite them to share what they have already learned about the stories and doctrinal principles that the songs teach. Invite the children to share their thoughts and feelings about the truths found in the songs.\nThe Children’s Songbook is the basic resource for music in Primary. Hymns from the hymnbook and songs from the Friend are also appropriate. You can also use songs from Hymns—For Home and Church . The use of any other music in Primary must be approved by the bishopric (see General Handbook , 12.3.4 ).\n## Music for Singing Time\n“ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ,” Children’s Songbook , 228–29\n“ I Will Follow God’s Plan ,” Children’s Songbook , 164–65\n“ Follow the Prophet ,” Children’s Songbook , 110–11\n“ A Child’s Prayer ,” Children’s Songbook , 12–13\n“ Kindness Begins with Me ,” Children’s Songbook , 145\n“ I Need Thee Every Hour ,” Hymns , no. 98\n“ Gethsemane ,” Gospel Library\n“ Keep the Commandments ,” Children’s Songbook , 146\n“Holy Places,” Gospel Library\n“ As I Search the Holy Scriptures ,” Hymns , no. 277\n“ I Will Be Valiant ,” Children’s Songbook , 162\n“ Love One Another ,” Children’s Songbook , 136\n“ Search, Ponder, and Pray ,” Children’s Songbook , 109\n“ I Pray in Faith ,” Children’s Songbook , 14\n“ Dare to Do Right ,” Children’s Songbook , 158\n“ I Feel My Savior’s Love ,” Children’s Songbook , 74–75\n“ Teach Me to Walk in the Light ,” Children’s Songbook , 177\n“ Love Is Spoken Here ,” Children’s Songbook , 190–91\n“ Seek the Lord Early ,” Children’s Songbook , 108\n“ I Lived in Heaven ,” Children’s Songbook , 4\n“ Families Can Be Together Forever ,” Children’s Songbook , 188\n“ Choose the Right ,” Hymns , no. 239\n“ We’ll Bring the World His Truth ,” Children’s Songbook , 172–73\n“ The Hearts of the Children ,” Children’s Songbook , 92–93\n## January\n“ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ,” Children’s Songbook , 228–29\n“ I Will Follow God’s Plan ,” Children’s Songbook , 164–65\n## February\n“ Follow the Prophet ,” Children’s Songbook , 110–11\n“ A Child’s Prayer ,” Children’s Songbook , 12–13\n## March\n“ Kindness Begins with Me ,” Children’s Songbook , 145\n“ I Need Thee Every Hour ,” Hymns , no. 98\n## April\n“ Gethsemane ,” Gospel Library\n“ Keep the Commandments ,” Children’s Songbook , 146\n## May\n“Holy Places,” Gospel Library\n“ As I Search the Holy Scriptures ,” Hymns , no. 277\n## June\n“ I Will Be Valiant ,” Children’s Songbook , 162\n“ Love One Another ,” Children’s Songbook , 136\n## July\n“ Search, Ponder, and Pray ,” Children’s Songbook , 109\n“ I Pray in Faith ,” Children’s Songbook , 14\n## August\n“ Dare to Do Right ,” Children’s Songbook , 158\n“ I Feel My Savior’s Love ,” Children’s Songbook , 74–75\n## September\n“ Teach Me to Walk in the Light ,” Children’s Songbook , 177\n“ Love Is Spoken Here ,” Children’s Songbook , 190–91\n## October\n“ Seek the Lord Early ,” Children’s Songbook , 108\n“ I Lived in Heaven ,” Children’s Songbook , 4\n## November\n“ Families Can Be Together Forever ,” Children’s Songbook , 188\n“ Choose the Right ,” Hymns , no. 239\n## December\n“ We’ll Bring the World His Truth ,” Children’s Songbook , 172–73\n“ The Hearts of the Children ,” Children’s Songbook , 92–93\n## Using Music to Teach Doctrine\nSinging time is intended to help the children learn the truths of the gospel. The following ideas can inspire you as you plan ways to teach the gospel principles found in hymns and Primary songs.\nRead related scriptures. For many of the songs in the Children’s Songbook and the hymnbook, references to related scriptures are listed. Help the children read some of these passages, and talk about how the scriptures are related to the song. You could also list a few scripture references on the board and invite the children to match each reference to a song or a verse from a song.\nFill in the blank. Write a verse of the song on the board with several key words missing. Then ask the children to sing the song, listening for the words that fill in the blanks. As they fill in each blank, discuss what gospel principles you learn from the missing words.\nTestify. Bear brief testimony to the children of gospel truths found in the Primary song. Help the children understand that singing is one way they can bear testimony and feel the Spirit.\nStand as a witness. Invite children to take turns standing and sharing what they learn from the song they are singing or how they feel about the truths taught in the song. Ask them how they feel as they sing the song, and help them identify the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nUse pictures. Ask the children to help you find or create pictures that go with important words or phrases in the song. Invite them to share how the pictures relate to the song and what the song teaches. For example, if you are teaching the song “ When He Comes Again ” ( Children’s Songbook , 82–83), you could place pictures throughout the room that depict important words from the song (such as angels , snow , and star ). Ask the children to gather the pictures and hold them up in the correct order as you sing the song together.\nShare an object lesson. You could use an object to inspire discussion about a song. For example, when singing the song “ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ” ( Children’s Songbook , 228–29), you could show the children a picture of things like a bird, rain, or flowers. This could lead to a discussion about how we can find signs of Heavenly Father’s love all around us.\nInvite sharing of personal experiences. Help the children connect the principles taught in the song with experiences they have had with these principles. For example, before singing “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95), you could ask the children to raise their hands if they have seen a temple. Invite them, as they sing, to think about how they feel when they see a temple.\nAsk questions. There are many questions you can ask as you sing songs. For example, you can ask the children what they learn from each verse in the song. You can also ask them to think of questions that the song answers. This can lead to a discussion about the truths taught in the song.\nUse simple hand actions. Invite the children to think of simple hand actions to help them remember the words and messages of a song.
