  "001-conversion",Conversion Is Our Goal,"","2 Corinthians 5:17,John 16:13,John 14:26","“Conversion Is Our Goal,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Doctrine and Covenants 2025\n(2025)\n“Conversion Is Our Goal,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2025\nConversion Is Our Goal\nThe aim of all gospel learning and teaching is to deepen our conversion and help us become more like Jesus Christ. For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond a classroom into an individual’s heart and home. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. True conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."
  "002-using","UsingCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church","","Moroni 6:4,Doctrine and Covenants 19:15–20","## Who Is This Resource For?\nThis resource is for anyone who wants to study the Doctrine and Covenants—individually, as a family, and in Church classes. If you haven’t studied the scriptures regularly in the past, this resource can help you get started. If you already have a good habit of scripture study, this resource can help you have more meaningful experiences.\n## Individuals and Families at Home\nThe ideal place to learn the gospel is at home. Your teachers at church can support you, and you can get encouragement from other ward members. But to survive spiritually, each of us needs daily nourishment from “the good word of God” ( Moroni 6:4 ; see also Russell M. Nelson, “ Opening Remarks ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 6–8).\nUse this resource in any way that is helpful to you. The outlines highlight some eternal truths found in the Doctrine and Covenants. They also suggest ideas and activities to help you study the scriptures individually, with family members, or with friends. As you study, follow the Spirit’s guidance to find eternal truths that are meaningful to you. Look for God’s messages for you, and follow the promptings you receive.\n## Teachers and Learners at Church\nIf you teach a Primary class, a youth or adult Sunday School class, an Aaronic Priesthood quorum, or a Young Women class, you are encouraged to use the outlines in this resource as you prepare to teach. Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church is the curriculum for your Sunday class. The learning ideas in this resource are designed for learning at home and at church. As you prepare to teach, start by having your own experiences in the scriptures. Your most important preparation will occur as you search the scriptures and seek personal inspiration from the Holy Ghost. You could also study with the needs of the people you teach in mind. Look for eternal truths. Come, Follow Me can help you identify some of these truths and learn how the scriptures can be applied in your life.\nKeep in mind that learning the gospel, at its best, is home centered and Church supported. In other words, your main responsibility is to support the people you teach in their efforts to learn and live the gospel at home. Don’t worry about having unique content to provide for them in class. Instead, give them opportunities to share their experiences, thoughts, and questions about the scripture passages they’ve read at home. Invite them to share the eternal truths they have found. This is more important than covering a certain amount of material.\nOne main reason we gather in Sunday School classes is to support and encourage one another as we strive to know and follow Jesus Christ. A simple way to do this is to ask a question like “What has the Holy Ghost taught you this week as you studied the scriptures with Come, Follow Me ?” Answers to this question could lead to meaningful discussions that build faith in Jesus Christ and His gospel.\nThen you could invite discussion based on the study suggestions in Come, Follow Me . For instance, a study idea might suggest searching Doctrine and Covenants 19:15–20 , looking for how the Savior described His suffering. You might ask class members to share how they felt as they read His description and talk about how this affects the way they think about Him. Or you could spend some time studying these verses as a class.\nWhen Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes meet on Sundays, their purpose is somewhat different from a Sunday School class. In addition to helping each other learn the gospel of Jesus Christ, these groups also meet to counsel together about accomplishing the work of salvation and exaltation (see General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 1.2 ), as directed by their class or quorum presidency.\nFor this reason, each quorum or class meeting should begin with a member of the quorum or class presidency leading a discussion about their efforts. For example, they could counsel together about their efforts to live the gospel, minister to people in need, share the gospel, or participate in temple and family history work.\nAfter this time for counseling together, an instructor leads the class or quorum in learning the gospel together. Adult leaders or members of the class or quorum can be assigned to teach. The class or quorum presidency, consulting with adult leaders, makes these assignments.\nPeople assigned to teach should prepare by using the learning suggestions in the weekly outline of Come, Follow Me . In each outline, this icon indicates an activity that is especially relevant to youth and aligned with what they are learning in seminary. However, any of the suggestions in the outline could be used as a learning activity for youth.\nFor a sample agenda for quorum and class meetings, see appendix D .\nYour preparation to teach Primary begins as you study the scriptures personally and with your family. As you do, be open to spiritual impressions and insights from the Holy Ghost about the children in your Primary class. Be prayerful. The Spirit can inspire you with ideas to help them learn the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nAs you prepare to teach, you might gain additional inspiration by exploring the teaching ideas in this resource. Each outline in Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church has a section titled “Ideas for Teaching Children.” Think of these ideas as suggestions to spark your inspiration. You know the children in your Primary class—and you will get to know them even better as you interact with them in class. God knows them too, and He will inspire you with the best ways to teach and bless them.\nChildren in your class may have already done some of the activities in Come, Follow Me with their families. That’s OK. Repetition is good. Consider inviting the children to share with each other what they learned at home. You should also plan ways for children to participate even if they aren’t learning at home. Children learn gospel truths more effectively when these truths are taught repeatedly through a variety of activities. If you find that a learning activity is effective for the children, consider repeating it, especially if you are teaching younger children.\nIn months that have five Sundays, Primary teachers are encouraged to replace the scheduled Come, Follow Me outline on the fifth Sunday with one or more of the learning activities in “ Appendix B: For Primary—Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path .”\n## Youth and Adult Sunday School Classes\nOne main reason we gather in Sunday School classes is to support and encourage one another as we strive to know and follow Jesus Christ. A simple way to do this is to ask a question like “What has the Holy Ghost taught you this week as you studied the scriptures with Come, Follow Me ?” Answers to this question could lead to meaningful discussions that build faith in Jesus Christ and His gospel.\nThen you could invite discussion based on the study suggestions in Come, Follow Me .

Sometimes truths about the Savior and His gospel are stated directly, and sometimes they are implied through an example or story. Ask yourself, “What eternal truths are taught in these verses? What do these truths teach me about the Savior?”\n## Listen to the Spirit\nPay attention to your thoughts and feelings, even if they are unrelated to what you are reading. These impressions may be what your Heavenly Father wants you to learn.\n## Record your impressions\nThere are many ways to record the impressions that come as you study. For example, you may find that certain words and phrases in the scriptures impress you; you could mark them and record your thoughts as a note in your scriptures. You could also keep a journal of the insights, feelings, and impressions you receive.\n## Share what you’re learning with others\nDiscussing insights from your personal study is a good way to teach others, and it also helps strengthen your understanding of what you have read. Share what you’re learning with family members and friends (in person or digitally), and invite them to do the same.\n## Relate the scriptures to your life\nConsider how the stories and teachings you are reading apply to your life. For example, you could ask yourself, “What experiences have I had that are similar to what I am reading?”\n## Ask questions as you study\nAs you study the scriptures, questions may come to mind. These questions might relate to what you are reading or to your life in general. Ponder these questions and look for answers as you continue studying the scriptures.\n## Use scripture study helps\nTo gain additional insights into the verses you read, use the footnotes, the Topical Guide , the Bible Dictionary , the Guide to the Scriptures , and other study helps.\n## Consider the context of the scriptures\nYou can find meaningful insights about a scripture passage as you consider its context, including the circumstances or setting it came from. For example, knowing the background and beliefs of the people God spoke to can help you better understand the intent of His words. You can learn about them in Saints , Revelations in Context , the section headings in the Doctrine and Covenants, and other resources.\n## Study the words of latter-day prophets and apostles\nRead what latter-day prophets and apostles have taught about the principles you find in the scriptures.\n## Live by what you learn\nScripture study should not only inspire us but also lead us to change the way we live. Listen to what the Spirit prompts you to do as you read, and then act on these promptings.\n## Use music\nSuggested hymns and children’s songs are found throughout Come, Follow Me . Use sacred music to invite the Spirit and to deepen your faith and testimony of gospel truths.\n## Memorize scriptures\nSelect a scripture passage that is meaningful to you, your family, or your class, and memorize it by repeating it daily or by playing a memorization game.\n## Share object lessons\nFind objects that relate to the chapters and verses that you are reading. Consider how each object relates to the teachings in the scriptures.\n## Draw, find, or take a picture\nRead a few verses, and then draw something that relates to what you read. Or you could look for a picture in the Gospel Art Book or elsewhere in the Gospel Library. You could also take a picture that illustrates what you learned.\n## Dramatize a story\nAfter reading a story, invite family or class members to act it out. Afterward, talk about how the story relates to the things that you are experiencing.\n## Be flexible at home\nIf you have family members who aren’t willing to participate in family scripture study, look for other ways to connect with them. For example, could you share eternal truth naturally in your conversations or share a meaningful scripture in a way that doesn’t seem preachy or overbearing? Scripture study doesn’t have to look the same in every family. Some children may respond better to studying the scriptures one on one. Be prayerful and follow the promptings of the Spirit.\nTeacher council meetings for parents. If you would like additional help in your efforts to teach your children, find out if your ward is holding teacher council meetings for parents (see General Handbook , 17.5 ). These meetings are an opportunity for parents to counsel and learn together about how to improve their teaching. They can discuss the principles in Teaching in the Savior’s Way , the ideas on these pages for improving family scripture study, and the learning and teaching suggestions found throughout Come, Follow Me ."

It identifies the book’s themes and purposes and helps readers prepare to read. As you read section 1 —the Lord’s “preface” to the Doctrine and Covenants ( verse 6 )—look for the themes and purposes the Lord gave for His revelations. What do you learn that will help you in your study of the Doctrine and Covenants this year? For example, you might ponder what it means to “hear the voice of the Lord” in these revelations ( verse 14 ) or to “search these commandments” ( verse 37 ).\nSee also the introduction to the Doctrine and Covenants .\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:4–6, 23–24, 37–39\nSection 1 begins and ends with the Lord’s declaration that He speaks through His chosen servants (see verses 4–6, 23–24, 38 ). Write down what you learn from this revelation about:\nThe Lord and His voice.\nWhy prophets are needed in our day.\nWhat do you feel impressed to do as a result of what you find?\nWhen have you heard the Lord’s voice through the voice of His servants? (see verse 38 ).\nYou could also imagine that a friend who doesn’t know about living prophets is reading section 1 with you. What questions might your friend have? Which verses would you want to discuss with your friend to help him or her understand how you feel about having prophets in our day?\nYou might be interested to know that when a council of elders met in 1831 to talk about publishing Joseph Smith’s revelations, some people opposed the idea. They were embarrassed by Joseph’s weakness in writing, and they worried that publishing the revelations might cause more problems for the Saints (see Saints , 1:140–43 ). If you had been a member of this council, how would you have addressed these concerns? What insights do you find in section 1 that might have helped? (see, for example, verses 6, 24, 38 ).\nConsider including a hymn like “ Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice ” ( Hymns , no. 21) in your study and worship.

It identifies the book’s themes and purposes and helps readers prepare to read. As you read section 1 —the Lord’s “preface” to the Doctrine and Covenants ( verse 6 )—look for the themes and purposes the Lord gave for His revelations. What do you learn that will help you in your study of the Doctrine and Covenants this year? For example, you might ponder what it means to “hear the voice of the Lord” in these revelations ( verse 14 ) or to “search these commandments” ( verse 37 ).\nSee also the introduction to the Doctrine and Covenants .\n## The Lord speaks through His servants, including latter-day prophets.\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:4–6, 23–24, 37–39\nSection 1 begins and ends with the Lord’s declaration that He speaks through His chosen servants (see verses 4–6, 23–24, 38 ). Write down what you learn from this revelation about:\nThe Lord and His voice.\nWhy prophets are needed in our day.\nWhat do you feel impressed to do as a result of what you find?\nWhen have you heard the Lord’s voice through the voice of His servants? (see verse 38 ).\nYou could also imagine that a friend who doesn’t know about living prophets is reading section 1 with you. What questions might your friend have? Which verses would you want to discuss with your friend to help him or her understand how you feel about having prophets in our day?\nYou might be interested to know that when a council of elders met in 1831 to talk about publishing Joseph Smith’s revelations, some people opposed the idea. They were embarrassed by Joseph’s weakness in writing, and they worried that publishing the revelations might cause more problems for the Saints (see Saints , 1:140–43 ). If you had been a member of this council, how would you have addressed these concerns? What insights do you find in section 1 that might have helped? (see, for example, verses 6, 24, 38 ).\nConsider including a hymn like “ Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice ” ( Hymns , no. 21) in your study and worship. Look for phrases in the hymn that teach the same principles as verses in section 1 .\nSee also Topics and Questions, “ Prophets ,” Gospel Library.\nThe Lord speaks to us through His servants, the prophets.\n## The Restoration helps me face the challenges of the latter days.\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:12–30, 34–36\nIn Doctrine and Covenants section 1 , the Lord explains why He restored His gospel. See how many reasons you can list as you read verses 12–23 . In your experience, how are the Lord’s purposes for the Restoration being accomplished?\nThe Lord knew that our day would have serious challenges (see verse 17 ). What do you find in verses 17–30, 34–36 that helps you feel peace and confidence despite these challenges?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “ Embrace the Future with Faith ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 73–76.\n## The Lord uses “the weak and the simple” to accomplish His work.\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:19–28\nAs you read Doctrine and Covenants 1:19–28 , you might ponder what it means to be a servant of the Lord. What characteristics does the Lord want His servants to have? What is the Lord accomplishing through His servants? How are the prophecies in these verses being fulfilled throughout the world and in your life?\nProclaimed by the Weak and the Simple\nLook for Jesus Christ.

Some examples might include a slippery floor, a coming storm, or an approaching car. Maybe you and your children could look at examples of warning signs and compare these warnings to the warnings the Lord gives us. According to Doctrine and Covenants 1:4, 37–39 , how does the Lord warn us? What has He warned us about recently? Perhaps you could watch or read parts of recent general conference messages and look for examples of God’s “voice of warning.”\nSing together a song about prophets, such as the last verse of “ Follow the Prophet ” ( Children’s Songbook , 111). Share your testimony that the prophet speaks the word of God.\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:17\nTo encourage discussion about Doctrine and Covenants 1:17 , you and your children could imagine you are preparing for a trip. What would you pack? If you knew ahead of time that it would rain or that your car or bus would get a flat tire, how would that affect the way you prepared for the trip? Read together verse 17 , and talk about what the Lord knew would happen to us. How did He prepare for it? (If necessary, explain that a “calamity” is a disaster or terrible thing.) How do God’s commandments help us deal with the challenges of our time?\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:17, 29\nTo learn about the role of Joseph Smith in restoring the Savior’s gospel, you and your children could look at a picture of the Savior and a picture of Joseph Smith (see the pictures in this outline) and talk about what the Savior gave us through Joseph Smith. Your children could look for examples in Doctrine and Covenants 1:17, 29 .

His parents’ religious convictions and practices planted seeds of faith that made the Restoration possible. Joseph’s journal records this tribute: “Words and language [are] inadequate to express the gratitude that I owe to God for having given me so honorable a parentage.”\nThe following quotations from his mother, Lucy Mack Smith; his brother William Smith; and the Prophet himself give us a glimpse into the religious influence in the Smith home.\nJoseph Smith Family , by Dan Baxter\n“[In about 1802], I was taken sick. … Said I to myself, I am not prepared to die for I do not know the ways of Christ, and it seemed to me as though there was a dark and lonely chasm between myself and Christ that I dare not attempt to cross. …\n“I looked to the Lord and begged and pled with the Lord that he would spare my life that I might bring up my children and comfort the heart of my husband; thus I lay all night. … I covenanted with God [that] if he would let me live I would endeavor to get that religion that would enable me to serve him right, whether it was in the Bible or wherever it might be found, even if it was to be obtained from heaven by prayer and faith. At last a voice spoke to me and said, ‘Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you. Let your heart be comforted. Ye believe in God; believe also in me.’ …\n“From this time forward I gained strength continually. I said but little upon the subject of religion although it occupied my mind entirely, and I thought that I would make all diligence as soon as I was able to seek some pious person who knew the ways of God to instruct me in things of Heaven.”\n“My mother, who was a very pious woman and much interested in the welfare of her children, both here and hereafter, made use of every means which her parental love could suggest, to get us engaged in seeking for our souls’ salvation, or (as the term then was) ‘in getting religion.’ She prevailed on us to attend the meetings, and almost the whole family became interested in the matter, and seekers after truth.”\n“We always had family prayers since I can remember. I well remember father used to carry his spectacles in his vest pocket, … and when us boys saw him feel for his specs, we knew that was a signal to get ready for prayer, and if we did not notice it mother would say, ‘William,’ or whoever was the negligent one, ‘get ready for prayer.’ After the prayer we had a song we would sing.”\nJoseph Sr. and Lucy Smith taught their family to study the scriptures.\n“I now say, that [my father] never did a mean act that might be said was ungenerous, in his life, to my knowledge.

But have you ever considered that God has a work for you too? As you read Joseph Smith—History 1:27–33 , think about what that work might be. How does it contribute to the ongoing Restoration of the Savior’s gospel?\nElder Gary E. Stevenson taught: “As we come unto Christ and help others do the same, we participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation, which focuses on divinely appointed responsibilities. … These responsibilities are simple, inspirational, motivating, and doable. Here they are:\nLiving the gospel of Jesus Christ\nCaring for those in need\nInviting all to receive the gospel\nUniting families for eternity” (“ Simply Beautiful—Beautifully Simple ,” Liahona , Nov. 2021, 47).\nPonder the experiences you’ve had participating in each of these divinely appointed responsibilities. What would the Savior have you do next? There is a Topics and Questions page for each of these responsibilities (see “Our Role in God’s Work of Salvation and Exaltation,” Gospel Library). You might explore these pages to help you answer this question.\nYou may sometimes feel like the Lord can’t use you because of mistakes you’ve made. What do you learn from Joseph Smith’s experience in Joseph Smith—History 1:28–29 ? How can you know your “standing before [God]”?\nAsk questions that encourage meaningful discussion. Questions that have more than one right answer invite learners to respond based on their personal thoughts, feelings, and experiences.

But have you ever considered that God has a work for you too? As you read Joseph Smith—History 1:27–33 , think about what that work might be. How does it contribute to the ongoing Restoration of the Savior’s gospel?\nElder Gary E. Stevenson taught: “As we come unto Christ and help others do the same, we participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation, which focuses on divinely appointed responsibilities. … These responsibilities are simple, inspirational, motivating, and doable.

The experience thrilled him, and he wondered if he could also receive revelation and the gift to translate. His first try, though, didn’t go well.\nIf you’ve ever struggled to receive or understand revelation, maybe you can relate to Oliver’s experience—and learn from it.

How can you recognize it?\nWhat else do you learn about revelation from these sections?\nOliver’s experiences might cause you to “cast your mind” on moments when you’ve felt that the Lord was speaking to you ( Doctrine and Covenants 6:22 ). Have you ever recorded your thoughts or feelings about these experiences? If so, consider reading what you wrote. If not, take some time to write down what you remember. Consider how you can continue to draw strength from these experiences. For some ideas, see Elder Neil L.

  "06a-voices-of-the-restoration-translation",Voices of the Restoration,"",sections 6–9,"## Translation of the Book of Mormon\nIn April 1829, the month when sections 6–9 of the Doctrine and Covenants were received, Joseph Smith’s main work was the translation of the Book of Mormon. We don’t know many details about the miraculous translation process, but we do know that Joseph Smith was a seer, aided by instruments that God had prepared: two transparent stones called the Urim and Thummim and another stone called a seer stone.\nWhen asked later to relate how this record was translated, Joseph said “that it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars.” He often stated simply that it was translated “by the gift, and power of God.”\nThe following statements, from eyewitnesses to the translation process, support Joseph’s witness.\nIt is believed that this box, which belonged to Hyrum Smith, was used to temporarily hide the gold plates.\n“When my husband was translating the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, and when he came to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.”\n“The plates often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen tablecloth, which I had given him to fold them in. I once felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book. …\n“My belief is that the Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, [Joseph] would dictate to me hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him. This was a usual thing for him to do. It would have been improbable that a learned man could do this; and, for one so ignorant and unlearned as he was, it was simply impossible.”\n“I wrote with my own pen the entire Book of Mormon (save a few pages) as it fell from the lips of the prophet, as he translated it by the gift and power of God, by means of the Urim and Thummim, or, as it is called by the book, holy interpreters. I beheld with my eyes, and handled with my hands, the gold plates from which it was translated. I also beheld the interpreters.”\n## Emma Smith\n“When my husband was translating the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, and when he came to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time.

The first refers to a specific right or privilege conferred upon all who receive the Aaronic or Melchizedek Priesthood. … For instance, Aaronic Priesthood holders receive the keys of the ministering of angels and the keys of the preparatory gospel of repentance and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins (see Doctrine and Covenants 13:1 ; 84:26–27 ). Melchizedek Priesthood holders receive the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, the key of the knowledge of God, and the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:19 ; 107:18 ). …\n“The second way the term priesthood keys is used refers to leadership. Priesthood leaders receive additional priesthood keys, the right to preside over an organizational division of the Church or a quorum. In this regard, priesthood keys are the authority and power to direct, lead, and govern in the Church” ( The Melchizedek Priesthood: Understanding the Doctrine, Living the Principles [2018], 26).\n## Ordinances give me access to God’s power.\nJoseph Smith—History 1:66–75\nHave you ever wondered what it would have been like to be with Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery for the major events of the Restoration? As you read Joseph Smith—History 1:66–75 , including the note at the end of verse 71 , you might understand at least some of what they felt. What impresses you about their words? Note, in particular, the blessings they received because they received the priesthood and were baptized. What blessings has the Savior given you through priesthood ordinances?\nTo learn more, consider creating a table with the headings Ordinances and Blessings . Then you could search scriptures like these to list ordinances and the blessings that come from them: John 14:26 ; Acts 2:38 ; Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–22 ; 131:1–4 ; Joseph Smith—History 1:73–74 . What other blessings would you add to the list? How have the ordinances you’ve received brought the Savior’s power into your life?\nSee also David A.

( Doctrine and Covenants 15:4 ; 16:4 ). As you read Doctrine and Covenants 15–16 , ponder why bringing souls to Christ is of such great worth.

  "08a-voices-of-the-restoration-witnesses",Voices of the Restoration,"","","## The Witnesses of the Book of Mormon\nThe angel Moroni showed the gold plates to Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris in the woods near the Whitmer home in Fayette, New York. Joseph’s parents were visiting the Whitmers at the time. Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph’s mother, described the effect this miraculous experience had on the witnesses:\n“It was between three and four o’clock. Mrs. Whitmer and Mr. Smith and myself were sitting in a bedroom. I sat on the bedside. When Joseph came in, he threw himself down beside me. ‘Father! Mother!’ said he. ‘You do not know how happy I am. The Lord has caused the plates to be shown to three more besides me, who have also seen an angel and will have to testify to the truth of what I have said. For they know for themselves that I do not go about to deceive the people. And I do feel as though I was relieved of a dreadful burden, which was almost too much for me to endure. But they will now have to bear a part, and it does rejoice my soul that I am not any longer to be entirely alone in the world.’ Martin Harris then came in. He seemed almost overcome with excess of joy. He then testified to what he had seen and heard, as did also the others, Oliver and David. Their testimony was the same in substance as that contained in the Book of Mormon. …\n“Martin Harris particularly seemed altogether unable to give vent to his feelings in words. He said, ‘I have now seen an angel from Heaven who has of a surety testified of the truth of all that I have heard concerning the record, and my eyes have beheld him. I have also looked upon the plates and handled them with my hands and can testify of the same to the whole world. But I have received for myself a witness that words cannot express, that no tongue can describe, and I bless God in the sincerity of my soul that he has condescended to make me, even me, a witness of the greatness of his work and designs in behalf [of] the children of men.’ Oliver and David also joined with him in solemn praises to God for his goodness and mercy. We returned home [to Palmyra, New York,] the next day a cheerful, rejoicing little company.”\nOliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris\nLucy Mack Smith was also present when the Eight Witnesses returned from their experience:\n“After these witnesses returned to the house, the angel again made his appearance to Joseph; at which time Joseph delivered up the plates into his hands. That evening we held a meeting, in which all the witnesses bore testimony to the facts as stated above; and all of our family, even to Don Carlos [Smith], who was but 14 years of age, testified of the truth of the latter day dispensation—that it was then fully ushered in.”\nRelief carving of Joseph Smith and the Eight Witnesses\nIn addition to the Three Witnesses and Eight Witnesses, Mary Whitmer, the mother of David Whitmer, was also blessed to be a witness of the gold plates. The angel Moroni showed them to her as an acknowledgment of the sacrifices she made while Joseph, Emma, and Oliver were living in her home. “You have been very faithful and diligent in your labors,” Moroni told her. “It is proper, therefore, that you should receive a witness that your faith may be strengthened.”"

You might find insights about these questions and others in Elder Ulisses Soares’s message “ Jesus Christ: The Caregiver of Our Soul ” ( Liahona , May 2021, 82–84). As you study, what impressions come to your mind? Consider recording your feelings about Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for you.\nAs part of your study and worship, you might look for a hymn that you can listen to or sing that expresses your gratitude to the Savior for His suffering on your behalf. “ I Stand All Amazed ” ( Hymns , no. 193) is a good example.\nWhat do you feel Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ would have you do as a result of what you have felt and studied?\nSee also “ Jesus Christ will help you ,” For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (2022), 6–9; Topics and Questions, “ Atonement of Jesus Christ ,” “ Repentance ,” Gospel Library; D. Todd Christofferson, “ The Divine Gift of Repentance ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2011, 38–41; “Jesus Suffers in Gethsemane” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Savior Suffers in Gethsemane\n## Peace comes from learning of Jesus Christ and following Him.\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:23\nConsider the Savior’s invitation: “Learn of me.” What do you learn about Jesus Christ in Doctrine and Covenants 19 ? Record your thoughts, and ponder how these truths about the Savior help you find peace. What does it mean to you to “walk in the meekness of [His] Spirit”?\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “ Finding Personal Peace ,” Liahona , May 2023, 29–31; “Peace in Christ” (video), Gospel Library.\nPeace in Christ\n## God’s blessings are greater than the treasures of the earth.\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:26–41\nThe Book of Mormon did not sell very well in Palmyra. As a result, Martin Harris ended up having to sell a large portion of his farm to pay the debt to the printer (see “ The Contributions of Martin Harris ,” in Revelations in Context , 7–8). Ponder Martin’s sacrifice—and the blessings you’ve received because of it—as you read Doctrine and Covenants 19:26–41 . You might also think about what the Lord has asked you to sacrifice. What do you find in these verses that inspires you to make these sacrifices with “rejoicing” and “gladness”? (see also verses 15–20 ).\nDetail from Martin Harris Farm , by Al Rounds\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–19\nYou can help your children feel reverence and gratitude for the Savior by reading together Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19 or “ Chapter 51: Jesus Suffers in the Garden of Gethsemane ,” in New Testament Stories , 129–32, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library. Consider pausing to make sure your children understand and to let them express their feelings. For example, in verse 16 , what are “these things” Jesus suffered for us? (see Mosiah 3:7 ; Alma 7:11–12 ). What do we learn from His description of His suffering? How can we show our gratitude for what He did for us?\nChapter 51: Jesus Suffers in the Garden of Gethsemane\nHelp children learn from the scriptures. Some children have a hard time reading scriptures. Focusing on a single verse or phrase may help them.\nYou and your children could look in Hymns or the Children’s Songbook for songs that help you express your feelings about Jesus Christ (see the topic indexes in these books).\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:18–19, 24\nSuffering for our sins was very difficult, but Jesus Christ was willing to do it to obey His Father and to show His love for Him and for us. You could look together at a picture of Jesus Christ suffering in Gethsemane (like those in this outline) and ask your children to tell you what they know about what is happening in the picture. You might read together Doctrine and Covenants 19:18–19, 24 to emphasize that suffering for our sins was the hardest thing anyone has ever done, but because Jesus loved His Father and us, He obeyed God’s will (see also Mosiah 3:7 ). What difficult things does God ask us to do? How can we find courage to obey Him?\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:23\nYou might help your children think of simple actions that go along with phrases in Doctrine and Covenants 19:23 . Read the verse several times while they do the actions. What are some ways we can learn of Christ and listen to His words?\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:38\nYou and your children could take turns holding a copy of the Book of Mormon and sharing what you love about it. Briefly talk about Martin Harris’s sacrifice so the Book of Mormon could be printed (see Doctrine and Covenants Stories , 33 ). What did the Lord say to Martin in Doctrine and Covenants 19:38 that might have helped him be faithful and obedient? Help your children think of something they can sacrifice to obey God or help in His work.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Jesus Christ suffered for me.\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–19\nYou can help your children feel reverence and gratitude for the Savior by reading together Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19 or “ Chapter 51: Jesus Suffers in the Garden of Gethsemane ,” in New Testament Stories , 129–32, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library.

But what was Emma like? What do we know about her personality, her relationships, her strengths? One way to get to know this “elect lady” ( Doctrine and Covenants 25:3 ) is to read the words of people who knew her personally.\n“With what unspeakable delight, and what transports of joy swelled my bosom, when I took by the hand, on that night, my beloved Emma—she that was my wife, even the wife of my youth; and the choice of my heart. Many were the re-vibrations of my mind when I contemplated for a moment the many scenes we had been called to pass through. The fatigues, and the toils, the sorrows, and sufferings, and the joys and consolations from time to time had strewed our paths and crowned our board. Oh! what a co-mingling of thought filled my mind for the moment. Again she is here, even in the seventh trouble, undaunted, firm, and unwavering, unchangeable, affectionate Emma.”\n“She was then young, and, being naturally ambitious, her whole heart was in the work of the Lord, and she felt no interest except for the church and the cause of truth. Whatever her hands found to do, she did with her might and did not ask the selfish question ‘Shall I be benefited any more than anyone else?’ If elders were sent away to preach, she was the first to volunteer her services to assist in clothing them for their journey, let her own privations be what they might.”\nEmma’s patriarchal blessing, pronounced by Joseph Smith Sr., who was serving as Patriarch to the Church:\n“Emma, my daughter-in-law, thou art blessed of the Lord, for thy faithfulness and truth: thou shalt be blessed with thy husband, and rejoice in the glory which shall come upon him: Thy soul has been afflicted because of the wickedness of men in seeking the destruction of thy companion, and thy whole soul has been drawn out in prayer for his deliverance: rejoice, for the Lord thy God has heard thy supplication.\n“Thou hast grieved for the hardness of the hearts of thy father’s house, and thou hast longed for their salvation. The Lord will have respect to thy cries, and by his judgments he will cause some of them to see their folly and repent of their sins; but it will be by affliction that they will be saved. Thou shall see many days; yea, the Lord will spare thee till thou art satisfied, for thou shalt see thy Redeemer. Thy heart shall rejoice in the great work of the Lord, and no one shall take thy rejoicing from thee.\n“Thou shalt ever remember the great condescension of thy God in permitting thee to accompany my son when the angel delivered the record of the Nephites to his care. Thou hast seen much sorrow because the Lord has taken from thee three of thy children: in this thou are not to be blamed, for he knows thy pure desires to raise up a family, that the name of my son might be blessed. And now, behold, I say unto thee, that thus says the Lord, if thou wilt believe, thou shalt yet be blessed in this thing and thou shalt bring forth other children, to the joy and satisfaction of thy soul, and to the rejoicing of thy friends.\n“Thou shalt be blessed with understanding, and have power to instruct thy sex.

  15a-voices-of-the-restoration-early-converts,Voices of the Restoration,"","Doctrine and Covenants 4:4,Doctrine and Covenants 31,Doctrine and Covenants 32","## Early Converts\nEven before the Church was organized in April 1830, the Lord declared, “The field is white already to harvest” ( Doctrine and Covenants 4:4 ). This statement proved true in the months that followed, as many seekers of truth were led by the Spirit of God to find the restored Church of Jesus Christ.\nMany of these early converts were instrumental in laying the foundation of the Restoration, and their stories of conversion are valuable to us today. The faith they showed is the same faith we need to become converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWhen Abigail Calkins Leonard was in her mid-thirties, she wanted to be forgiven of her sins. She occasionally read the Bible, and people from Christian churches visited her home, but she was confused about what made one church different from another. “One morning,” she said, “I took my Bible and went to the woods, when I fell upon my knees.” She prayed fervently to the Lord. “Immediately a vision passed before my eyes,” she said, “and the different sects passed one after another by me, and a voice called to me, saying: ‘These are built up for gain.’ Then, beyond, I could see a great light, and a voice from above called out: ‘I shall raise up a people, whom I shall delight to own and bless.’” A short while later, Abigail heard about the Book of Mormon. Even though she didn’t yet have a copy, she sought to “know the truth of this book, by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost,” and she “immediately felt its presence.” When she finally was able to read the Book of Mormon, she was “ready to receive it.” She and her husband, Lyman, were baptized in 1831.\nWhen Thomas B. Marsh was a young adult, he studied the Bible and joined a Christian church. But he was unsatisfied, finally withdrawing from all churches. “I had a measure of the spirit of prophecy,” he said, “and told [a religious leader] that I expected a new church would arise, which would have the truth in its purity.” Not long after this, Thomas had a spiritual prompting to leave his home in Boston, Massachusetts, and travel west. After spending three months in western New York without finding what he was looking for, he started for home. On the way, a woman asked Thomas if he had heard about “the Golden Book found by a youth named Joseph Smith.” Captivated by this thought, Thomas immediately traveled to Palmyra and met Martin Harris at the printing shop, just as the first 16 pages of the Book of Mormon were coming off the press. Thomas was allowed to take a copy of those 16 pages, and he brought them home to his wife, Elizabeth. “She was well pleased” with the book, he recalled, “believing it to be the work of God.” Thomas and Elizabeth later moved to New York with their children and were baptized. (For more information about Thomas B. Marsh, see Doctrine and Covenants 31 .)\nLike Thomas Marsh, Parley and Thankful Pratt responded to spiritual stirrings to leave their prosperous farm in Ohio with the intent to preach the gospel as they understood it from the Bible. As Parley told his brother, “The spirit of these things had wrought so powerfully on my mind of late that I could not rest.” When they reached eastern New York, Parley had a prompting to stay awhile in the area. Thankful, they decided, would continue on without him. “I have a work to do in this region of country,” Parley told her, “and what it is, or how long it will take to perform it, I know not; but I will come when it is performed.” It was there that Parley first heard of the Book of Mormon. “I felt a strange interest in the book,” he said. He requested a copy and read through the night. By morning, he knew the book was true, valuing it “more than all the riches of the world.” Within a few days Parley was baptized. He then returned to Thankful, who was also baptized. (For more information about Parley P. Pratt, see Doctrine and Covenants 32 .)\nParley and Thankful Pratt: Faith to follow the Spirit\nParley P. Pratt Reads the Book of Mormon , by Jeffrey Hein\nOn his way from New York to a mission in Missouri, Parley Pratt and his fellow laborers stopped in Mentor, Ohio, at the home of Sidney and Phebe Rigdon—old friends Parley knew from his days in Ohio. Sidney was a Christian minister, and Parley was once a member of his congregation and considered him a spiritual mentor. Parley eagerly told his friends about the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of Jesus Christ’s gospel. Sidney himself had been searching for a restoration of the true Church that he found described in the New Testament, though he was skeptical about the Book of Mormon at first. “But I will read your book,” he told his friend Parley, “and will endeavor to ascertain, whether it be a revelation from God or not.” After two weeks of study and prayer, both he and Phebe were convinced the book was true. But Sidney also knew that joining the Church would be a major sacrifice for his family. He would obviously lose his job as a minister, along with his social status in the community. As he and Phebe discussed this possibility, Phebe declared, “I have counted the cost, and … it is my desire to do the will of God, come life or come death.”\nSidney and Phebe Rigdon: Changing their lives to accept the gospel\n## Abigail Calkins Leonard\nWhen Abigail Calkins Leonard was in her mid-thirties, she wanted to be forgiven of her sins.

Marsh\nWhen Thomas B. Marsh was a young adult, he studied the Bible and joined a Christian church. But he was unsatisfied, finally withdrawing from all churches. “I had a measure of the spirit of prophecy,” he said, “and told [a religious leader] that I expected a new church would arise, which would have the truth in its purity.” Not long after this, Thomas had a spiritual prompting to leave his home in Boston, Massachusetts, and travel west. After spending three months in western New York without finding what he was looking for, he started for home. On the way, a woman asked Thomas if he had heard about “the Golden Book found by a youth named Joseph Smith.” Captivated by this thought, Thomas immediately traveled to Palmyra and met Martin Harris at the printing shop, just as the first 16 pages of the Book of Mormon were coming off the press. Thomas was allowed to take a copy of those 16 pages, and he brought them home to his wife, Elizabeth. “She was well pleased” with the book, he recalled, “believing it to be the work of God.” Thomas and Elizabeth later moved to New York with their children and were baptized. (For more information about Thomas B. Marsh, see Doctrine and Covenants 31 .)\n## Parley and Thankful Pratt\nLike Thomas Marsh, Parley and Thankful Pratt responded to spiritual stirrings to leave their prosperous farm in Ohio with the intent to preach the gospel as they understood it from the Bible. As Parley told his brother, “The spirit of these things had wrought so powerfully on my mind of late that I could not rest.” When they reached eastern New York, Parley had a prompting to stay awhile in the area. Thankful, they decided, would continue on without him. “I have a work to do in this region of country,” Parley told her, “and what it is, or how long it will take to perform it, I know not; but I will come when it is performed.” It was there that Parley first heard of the Book of Mormon. “I felt a strange interest in the book,” he said. He requested a copy and read through the night. By morning, he knew the book was true, valuing it “more than all the riches of the world.” Within a few days Parley was baptized. He then returned to Thankful, who was also baptized. (For more information about Parley P. Pratt, see Doctrine and Covenants 32 .)\nParley and Thankful Pratt: Faith to follow the Spirit\nParley P. Pratt Reads the Book of Mormon , by Jeffrey Hein\n## Sidney and Phebe Rigdon\nOn his way from New York to a mission in Missouri, Parley Pratt and his fellow laborers stopped in Mentor, Ohio, at the home of Sidney and Phebe Rigdon—old friends Parley knew from his days in Ohio. Sidney was a Christian minister, and Parley was once a member of his congregation and considered him a spiritual mentor. Parley eagerly told his friends about the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of Jesus Christ’s gospel. Sidney himself had been searching for a restoration of the true Church that he found described in the New Testament, though he was skeptical about the Book of Mormon at first. “But I will read your book,” he told his friend Parley, “and will endeavor to ascertain, whether it be a revelation from God or not.” After two weeks of study and prayer, both he and Phebe were convinced the book was true. But Sidney also knew that joining the Church would be a major sacrifice for his family. He would obviously lose his job as a minister, along with his social status in the community. As he and Phebe discussed this possibility, Phebe declared, “I have counted the cost, and … it is my desire to do the will of God, come life or come death.”"

Why is it a blessing to know that Joseph Smith and others saw the risen Savior?\nThe truths Joseph Smith learned about forgiveness through Christ can give your children hope that they can be forgiven of their mistakes and sins. Consider inviting your children to create a table with headings like these: What the Savior did for me and What I must do to receive His forgiveness . Help your children search the following passages to find things that belong under these headings: Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–13 ; 19:16–19 ; 45:3–5 ; 58:42–43 .

You could also watch together the video “Men’s Hearts Shall Fail Them” (Gospel Library).\n## I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when I am confirmed.\nDoctrine and Covenants 39:6, 23\nConsider showing a picture of someone being confirmed. Ask your children to describe what’s happening in the picture. You could also invite them to point to the picture whenever they hear the words Holy Ghost in Doctrine and Covenants 39:6, 23 (or in a song like “ The Holy Ghost ,” Children’s Songbook , 105). Share with each other how the gift of the Holy Ghost has blessed you.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

She joined the Church in the northeastern United States in her mid-twenties, though her parents did not. She later wrote of her decision to move to Ohio to unite with the Saints:\n“My friends marveled at my course, as did I, but something within impelled me on. My mother’s grief at my leaving home was almost more than I could bear; and had it not been for the spirit within I should have faltered at the last. My mother told me she would rather see me buried than going thus alone out into the heartless world.\n“‘[Phebe],’ she said, impressively, ‘will you come back to me if you find Mormonism false?’\n“I answered, ‘yes, mother; I will.’ … My answer relieved her trouble; but it cost us all much sorrow to part. When the time came for my departure I dared not trust myself to say farewell; so I wrote my good-byes to each, and leaving them on my table, ran downstairs and jumped into the carriage. Thus I left the beloved home of my childhood to link my life with the saints of God.”\nIn one of those farewell messages, Phebe wrote:\n“Beloved Parents—I am now about to leave my paternal roof for a while … I know not how long—but not without grateful feelings for the kindness which I have received from my infancy until the present time—but Providence seems to order it otherwise now than it has been. Let us commit all these things into the hands of Providence and be thankful that we have been permitted to live together so long under so favorable circumstances as we have, believing that all things will work for our good if we love God supremely. Let us realize that we can pray to one God who will hear the sincere prayers of all his creatures and give us that which is best for us. …\n“Mother, I believe it is the will of God for me to go to the west and I have been convinced that it has been for a long time. Now the way has opened … ; I believe that it is the spirit of the Lord that has done it which is sufficient for all things. O be not anxious for your child; the Lord will comfort me. I believe that the Lord will take care of me and give me that which is for the best. … I go because my Master calls—he has made my duty plain.”\n## Phebe Carter\nAmong the many Saints who gathered to Ohio in the 1830s was Phebe Carter.

How do they prepare for the visit? Then you could show a picture of the Savior and read Doctrine and Covenants 45:44–45 . Share with each other how you feel about the Savior’s coming.\nPersonal Preparation to Meet the Savior\nTo help your children feel excited about the Savior’s Second Coming, you could write on slips of paper some of the hopeful promises from section 45 (see, for example, verses 44–45, 51–52, 55, 58–59, 66–71 ). Give your children the papers and ask them to raise their hand when the promise they are holding is mentioned as you read the verses. Discuss what these promises mean. You could also sing with your children a song about the Savior’s Second Coming, such as “ When He Comes Again ” ( Children’s Songbook , 82–83).\nHelp children recognize the Spirit. As you teach your children, tell them when you feel the Holy Ghost. Talk about how you recognize His influence. For example, you might feel peaceful or joyful while singing a song about the Savior.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Jesus Christ is my Advocate with the Father.\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:3–5\nYou might want to help your children understand that an advocate is someone who supports another person.

How can we make our home a more holy place?\n## The gospel of Jesus Christ is a standard to the world.\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:9\nYou might explain to your children that anciently, a standard was a banner or flag carried into battle. It helped soldiers know where to gather and what to do. Read together Doctrine and Covenants 45:9 , and discuss ways the gospel is like a standard. Your children may enjoy making their own standard or flag, including images or words that express their feelings about the Savior.\nThe gospel is like a standard, or a banner or flag.\n## Jesus Christ will come again.\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:44–45\nThe destruction that will happen before the Second Coming may make children afraid. Pointing them to Jesus Christ can help them look forward with faith! Consider inviting them to think about how they feel when someone special is coming to visit, like a grandparent or friend. How do they prepare for the visit? Then you could show a picture of the Savior and read Doctrine and Covenants 45:44–45 . Share with each other how you feel about the Savior’s coming.\nPersonal Preparation to Meet the Savior\nTo help your children feel excited about the Savior’s Second Coming, you could write on slips of paper some of the hopeful promises from section 45 (see, for example, verses 44–45, 51–52, 55, 58–59, 66–71 ). Give your children the papers and ask them to raise their hand when the promise they are holding is mentioned as you read the verses. Discuss what these promises mean. You could also sing with your children a song about the Savior’s Second Coming, such as “ When He Comes Again ” ( Children’s Songbook , 82–83).\nHelp children recognize the Spirit. As you teach your children, tell them when you feel the Holy Ghost. Talk about how you recognize His influence. For example, you might feel peaceful or joyful while singing a song about the Savior.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

He would then return to you, in most cases, what you donated, sometimes with a surplus. But it was no longer just your possession—it was your stewardship.\nToday the procedures are different, but the principles are still vital to the Lord’s work. As you read section 51 , think about what God has entrusted to you. What do the words “steward” ( verse 19 ) and “consecrated” ( verse 5 ) imply about God’s expectations of you?\nPresident Spencer W.

In what ways do we sometimes “hide [our] talent”? ( Doctrine and Covenants 60:2 ; see also Matthew 25:14–30 ).\nWhat encouraging messages from the Lord do you find in sections 60 and 62 ? How do these messages build your confidence in sharing the gospel?

Look for these truths in Doctrine and Covenants 60:2–4 ; 61:1–2, 20, 36–38 ; 62:1, 6 . What accounts from the scriptures illustrate the roles and attributes of the Savior that you found? (see, for example, John 8:1–11 ; Ether 2:14–15 ).\nDoctrine and Covenants 62\nThe Lord gives direction about eternal truths and principles, but He often leaves it to us to determine the specific details about how to act on these principles. How do you see this principle illustrated in Doctrine and Covenants 62 ? (see also Doctrine and Covenants 60:5 ; 61:22 ). How have you seen this principle in your life? Why is it good for us to make some decisions without expecting God to tell us exactly what to do?\nSee also Ether 2:18–25 ; Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 .\nDoctrine and Covenants 63:7–12\nAt the end of this outline, there’s an illustration of a miracle that deeply impressed Ezra Booth: Elsa Johnson’s arm was miraculously healed. After seeing that, Ezra was eagerly baptized. And yet, within just a few months, Ezra lost his faith and became critical of the Prophet.

How do you see this principle illustrated in Doctrine and Covenants 62 ? (see also Doctrine and Covenants 60:5 ; 61:22 ). How have you seen this principle in your life?

One concern had to do with imperfections in the way Joseph Smith wrote the revelations. The revelation in section 67 came in response to that concern. What do you learn about the Lord’s prophets and revelation from verses 1–9 ? What additional insights do you gain from 68:3–6 ?\nHow have you come to know for yourself that the revelations God gives His servants are true? You might also ponder experiences when you felt the Lord was speaking to you through one of His servants (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:4 ). When have you felt “moved upon by the Holy Ghost” ( verse 3 ) to say something? How did the Lord “stand by you”? ( verse 6 ).\nBefore the Book of Commandments was printed, several Church leaders signed a written testimony that the revelations in the book are true.

How do we overcome the “natural man” or “carnal mind” so that we can “see [Him] and know that [He is]”? ( verse 10 ; see also Mosiah 3:19 ). What do you find in these verses that inspires you to “continue in patience until ye are perfected”? ( verse 13 ).\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–31\nThe Lord’s words in Doctrine and Covenants 68:25–31 refer specifically to parents, but whether or not you’re a parent, you can use His counsel to do your part to center your home on the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Listed below are some of the principles the Lord says should be taught in the home.

One concern had to do with imperfections in the way Joseph Smith wrote the revelations. The revelation in section 67 came in response to that concern. What do you learn about the Lord’s prophets and revelation from verses 1–9 ? What additional insights do you gain from 68:3–6 ?\nHow have you come to know for yourself that the revelations God gives His servants are true? You might also ponder experiences when you felt the Lord was speaking to you through one of His servants (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:4 ). When have you felt “moved upon by the Holy Ghost” ( verse 3 ) to say something? How did the Lord “stand by you”? ( verse 6 ).\nBefore the Book of Commandments was printed, several Church leaders signed a written testimony that the revelations in the book are true.

More accurately, section 76 is about Jesus Christ, who makes God’s plan for our salvation and eternal glory possible. As you read, you might look for words or phrases that describe the relationship between Jesus Christ and the people who inherit the different kingdoms of glory. Perhaps a table like the following could help you record what you find.\nKingdom of glory\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nEternal blessings\nKingdom of glory\nCelestial ( verses 50–70 , 92–96 )\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nReceived testimony of Jesus\nMade and kept covenants with Him\nEternal blessings\nCleansed from sin\nOvercome by faith\nKingdom of glory\nTerrestrial ( verses 71–79 , 97 )\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nEternal blessings\nKingdom of glory\nTelestial ( verses 81–90 , 98–106 , 109–12 )\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nEternal blessings\nWhat do you feel inspired to do to strengthen your relationship with the Savior?\nWhen Wilford Woodruff read this vision, he said, “I felt to love the Lord more than ever before in my life” (see “ Voices of the Restoration: Testimonies of ‘the Vision’ ”). What do you learn about Jesus Christ from verses 1–5 , 20–24 , 39–43 , 107–8 that causes you to love Him more?\nSee also 1 Peter 3:18–19 ; 4:6 ; Dallin H. Oaks, “ What Has Our Savior Done for Us? ,” Liahona , May 2021, 75–77; “ I Stand All Amazed ,” Hymns , no. 193.\nFocus on Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and Their doctrine. Of everything we can learn in the scriptures, the most important truths help us build faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, repent, make and keep covenants with Them, and receive the Holy Ghost. Although it may be interesting to compare or analyze the attitudes or behavior of people who will receive the different kingdoms of glory, it’s more important to focus on Heavenly Father and the Savior. Everything They do to prepare us for that glory will turn us toward Them.\nIn this room, Joseph Smith saw the vision recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 76.\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:5–10 , 114–18\nNot all members of the Church easily accepted the revelation in section 76 , because it taught that almost everyone would be saved and receive some degree of glory. For example, Brigham Young said: “My traditions were such, that when the Vision came first to me, it was directly contrary and opposed to my former education. I said, Wait a little. I did not reject it; but I could not understand it.” He explained that he had to “think and pray, to read and think, until I knew and fully understood it for myself” (in “ The Vision ,” in Revelations in Context , 150). What do you learn from his experience that can help you when God reveals things that are different from your current understanding? What do you learn about God in Doctrine and Covenants 76:5–10 , 114–18 ? What do these verses teach about how you can understand “the good pleasure of [God’s] will”? ( verse 7 ).\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:39–44, 50–70\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:39–44 describe salvation generally. Verses 50–70 describe exaltation, a specific kind of salvation. How would you explain the difference between salvation and exaltation? What is the Savior’s role in both? What do you find in these verses that inspires you to seek exaltation?\nSee also John 3:16–17 ; Doctrine and Covenants 132:20–25 .\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:50–70, 92–95\nHave you ever wondered—or worried—about whether you can become the kind of person who will receive celestial glory, as described in Doctrine and Covenants 76:50–70, 92–95 ? While it’s important to know what God expects of us, consider also looking in these verses for what God has done for us—and is doing—to help us become like Him. Why do you feel your efforts matter to Him?\nHow does this vision of celestial glory affect the way you want to live your daily life?\nSee also Moses 1:39 ; J. Devn Cornish, “ Am I Good Enough?

What do you learn about Jesus Christ from verses 1–5 , 20–24 , 39–43 , 107–8 that causes you to love Him more?\nSee also 1 Peter 3:18–19 ; 4:6 ; Dallin H. Oaks, “ What Has Our Savior Done for Us? ,” Liahona , May 2021, 75–77; “ I Stand All Amazed ,” Hymns , no. 193.\nFocus on Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and Their doctrine. Of everything we can learn in the scriptures, the most important truths help us build faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, repent, make and keep covenants with Them, and receive the Holy Ghost. Although it may be interesting to compare or analyze the attitudes or behavior of people who will receive the different kingdoms of glory, it’s more important to focus on Heavenly Father and the Savior. Everything They do to prepare us for that glory will turn us toward Them.\nIn this room, Joseph Smith saw the vision recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 76.\n## I can understand God’s will “by the power of the Holy Spirit.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:5–10 , 114–18\nNot all members of the Church easily accepted the revelation in section 76 , because it taught that almost everyone would be saved and receive some degree of glory. For example, Brigham Young said: “My traditions were such, that when the Vision came first to me, it was directly contrary and opposed to my former education. I said, Wait a little. I did not reject it; but I could not understand it.” He explained that he had to “think and pray, to read and think, until I knew and fully understood it for myself” (in “ The Vision ,” in Revelations in Context , 150). What do you learn from his experience that can help you when God reveals things that are different from your current understanding? What do you learn about God in Doctrine and Covenants 76:5–10 , 114–18 ? What do these verses teach about how you can understand “the good pleasure of [God’s] will”? ( verse 7 ).\n## Exaltation is the highest form of salvation.\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:39–44, 50–70\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:39–44 describe salvation generally. Verses 50–70 describe exaltation, a specific kind of salvation. How would you explain the difference between salvation and exaltation? What is the Savior’s role in both? What do you find in these verses that inspires you to seek exaltation?\nSee also John 3:16–17 ; Doctrine and Covenants 132:20–25 .\n## My Heavenly Father wants me to receive eternal life in the celestial kingdom.\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:50–70, 92–95\nHave you ever wondered—or worried—about whether you can become the kind of person who will receive celestial glory, as described in Doctrine and Covenants 76:50–70, 92–95 ? While it’s important to know what God expects of us, consider also looking in these verses for what God has done for us—and is doing—to help us become like Him. Why do you feel your efforts matter to Him?\nHow does this vision of celestial glory affect the way you want to live your daily life?\nSee also Moses 1:39 ; J. Devn Cornish, “ Am I Good Enough?

  28a-voices-of-the-restoration-testimonies-of-the-vision,"Voices of the Restoration: Testimonies of “the Vision”","","Doctrine and Covenants 76,section 76","## Wilford Woodruff\nWilford Woodruff joined the Church in December 1833, nearly two years after Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon received the vision recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 76 . He was living in New York at the time and learned about “the Vision” from missionaries serving in the area. Years later, he spoke of his impressions of this revelation:\n“I was taught from my childhood that there was one Heaven and one Hell, and was told that the wicked all had one punishment and the righteous one glory. …\n“… When I read the vision … , it enlightened my mind and gave me great joy, it appeared to me that the God who revealed that principle unto man was wise, just and true, possessed both the best of attributes and good sense and knowledge, I felt He was consistent with both love, mercy, justice and judgment, and I felt to love the Lord more than ever before in my life.”\n“The ‘Vision’ [is] a revelation which gives more light, more truth and more principle than any revelation contained in any other book we ever read. It makes plain to our understanding our present condition, where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going to. Any man may know through that revelation what his part and condition will be.”\n“Before I saw Joseph I said I did not care how old he was, or how young he was; I did not care how he looked—whether his hair was long or short; the man that advanced that revelation [the vision recorded in section 76 ] was a prophet of God. I knew it for myself.”\n## Phebe Crosby Peck\nWhen Phebe Peck heard Joseph and Sidney teach of “the Vision,” she was living in Missouri and raising five children as a single mother. The vision so impressed and inspired her that she wrote the following to share what she had learned with her extended family:\n“The Lord is revealing the mysteries of the heavenly Kingdom unto his Children. … Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon made us a visit last spring, and we had many joyful meetings while they were here, and we had many mysteries unfolded to our view, which gave me great consolation. We could view the condescension of God in preparing mansions of peace for his children. And whoso will not receive the fullness of the gospel and stand as valiant soldiers in the cause of Christ cannot dwell in the presence of the Father and the Son. But there is a place prepared for all who do not receive, but it is a place of much lesser glory than to dwell in the Celestial kingdom. I shall not attempt to say any farther concerning these things as they are now in print and are going forth to the world. And you perhaps will have an opportunity of reading for yourself, and if you do, I hope you will read with a careful and a prayerful heart, for these things are worthy of notice. And I desire that you may search into them, for it is that which lends to our happiness in this world and in the world to come.”"

In addition to fervent prayer, she set an ambitious goal of increased temple attendance and felt sure that the Lord would honor this significant sacrifice by changing her children’s hearts. The woman reported:\n“After ten years of increased temple attendance and constant prayer, I am sorry to say that my children’s choices have not changed. …\n“But I have. I am a different woman. … I have a softer heart. I am filled with compassion. I can actually do more and am free of fear, anxiety, guilt, blame, and dread. I have given up my time limits and am able to wait on the Lord. And I experience frequent manifestations of the Lord’s power. He sends tender mercies, small messages that acknowledge his love for me and my children. My expectations have changed. Instead of expecting my children to change, I expect these frequent tender mercies and am full of gratitude for them. …\n“My prayers are changed. I express more love and am more thankful. … The Lord works in marvelous ways, and I truly am filled with the peace that passeth all understanding” (in “ Prayer: A Small and Simple Thing ,” At the Pulpit [2017], 288–89).\nDoctrine and Covenants 83\nIn April 1832, as instructed by the Lord, Joseph Smith traveled nearly 800 miles to visit the Saints who had gathered in Missouri (see Doctrine and Covenants 78:9 ). While he was there, he visited a community where several widows were raising their children alone. Among them were Phebe Peck and Anna Rogers, whom the Prophet knew personally. In Missouri in the 1830s, state laws gave widows limited rights to their deceased husbands’ property. What do you learn from section 83 about how the Lord feels about widows and orphans?

Consider marking the passages as you find them. One of the most descriptive examples is in Doctrine and Covenants 81:4–5 . Here are some questions to help you ponder these verses:\nWhat are some ways a person can be “weak”? What does it mean to “succor” them? When has the Christlike service of others helped me when I felt weak?\nWhat might cause a person’s hands to figuratively “hang down”? How can I “lift up” those hands?\nWhat might “feeble knees” mean? How are they strengthened?\nHow does the Savior do these things for you?\nPerhaps studying this verse has brought to mind someone you could “succor,” “lift up,” or “strengthen.” What will you do to minister to that person?\nWhat else do you learn about service to others in Doctrine and Covenants 82:18–19 ?

Which insights from these verses could help you explain to someone why you choose to follow the Lord’s commandments? What could you compare the commandments to that might help? You could find additional insights in Doctrine and Covenants 1:37–38 ; 130:20–21 and the video “Blessed and Happy Are Those Who Keep the Commandments of God” (Gospel Library). What experiences have taught you to see commandments as blessings?\nBlessed and Happy Are Those Who Keep the Commandments of God\nThink about some of the commandments God has given you. What have these commandments taught you about Him and His will? (see verse 8 ). How has your life been affected by keeping these commandments?\nWhat do you learn about the Lord from verse 10 ? What do you think it means for the Lord to be “bound”? (see also verse 15 ).\nHow has the Lord kept His promises in your life? What might you say to someone who doesn’t feel motivated to keep the commandments because they haven’t received the blessings they hoped for?

Pearce, former member of the Young Women General Presidency, spoke about a woman who worried desperately about her children who were making unrighteous choices. In a near panic, she tried everything she could think of to seek the Lord’s blessings on their behalf. In addition to fervent prayer, she set an ambitious goal of increased temple attendance and felt sure that the Lord would honor this significant sacrifice by changing her children’s hearts. The woman reported:\n“After ten years of increased temple attendance and constant prayer, I am sorry to say that my children’s choices have not changed. …\n“But I have. I am a different woman. … I have a softer heart. I am filled with compassion. I can actually do more and am free of fear, anxiety, guilt, blame, and dread.

You might also listen to or sing with them a hymn about prayer, such as “ Secret Prayer ” ( Hymns , no. 144). Share with each other something from the hymn that teaches an important truth about prayer. You could also talk about speaking reverently to Heavenly Father.\nTo encourage your children to pray in their hearts, you could give them paper hearts and invite them to draw or write something they want to pray about to Heavenly Father. Testify that Heavenly Father knows what we are thinking and feeling and He can hear our prayers even if we don’t say them out loud. You might share with them an experience when you prayed in your heart and Heavenly Father heard you.\nDoctrine and Covenants 81:5\nWith your children, draw pictures of hands and knees, and ask your children to find these body parts in Doctrine and Covenants 81:5 . What is the Lord asking us to do in this verse? You might share with each other some ways that people have strengthened you when you felt “weak” or “feeble.” The video “Pass It On” ( ChurchofJesusChrist.org ) could give your children ideas about how they serve others. You could also sing a song about service, such as “ Have I Done Any Good? ” ( Hymns , no. 223). Consider helping your children make a plan to help at least one person in need this week.\nPass It On\nYou could also use pictures or videos to tell simple stories of Jesus Christ serving others (see the pictures in this outline; Gospel Art Book , nos. 41 , 42 , 46 , 47 , 55 ; or one of the Bible Videos in Gospel Library). How can we follow the Savior’s example of helping others?\nServing in the Savior's Way\nWe can reach out to people in need as the Savior did.\nHelp your children receive their own inspiration. Teaching means more than just sharing truth—it means helping other people become independent learners. Instead of simply telling your children how they can serve others, for example, encourage them to seek the Lord’s guidance to know who they can help.\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:10\nYou and your children could look in Doctrine and Covenants 82:8–10 for answers to the question “Why does Heavenly Father give us commandments?” You might want to help your children think of examples of His commandments (see, for example, Exodus 20:4–17 ; Matthew 22:37–39 ; Doctrine and Covenants 89:5–17 ). It might help if you and your children find or draw pictures to represent some of them. How do Heavenly Father’s commandments show His love for us?\nPerhaps a simple game would help your children see God’s commandments as blessings, not burdens. One person could give instructions to help another person, who is blindfolded, to do something like make a sandwich or draw a picture. Think of something fun and creative! Then talk about how God’s commandments are like the instructions in this game.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## I can pray to God “vocally and in [my] heart.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 81:3\nAs you read Doctrine and Covenants 81:3 with your children, help them think of different “public” and “private” places where they can pray.

On the back of each piece, you could write something we do in the temple, such as being baptized for ancestors, being sealed to our families, and making covenants with God. Read Doctrine and Covenants 84:4–5 with your children, and ask them to listen for what the Lord commanded the Saints to build. As you and your children put the puzzle together, share with each other things we can do to prepare to enter the temple.\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:19–22\nTo help your children understand what an ordinance is, consider looking at pictures of several priesthood ordinances with them, such as Gospel Art Book , nos. 103–8 , or this week’s activity page . Ask them to describe what is happening in each picture. You could then read together Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–22 . Why does Heavenly Father want us to receive these ordinances?

In what sense is the Spirit’s voice “still” and “small”? Consider these additional descriptions given through Joseph Smith: Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–24 ; 8:2–3 ; 9:7–9 ; 11:12–13 ; 128:1 .

People remember a gospel lesson better when they see or participate in an object lesson related to what they are learning. For example, when teaching about the still, small voice of the Spirit, maybe you could play a recording of soft, sacred music, and learners could talk about how the music makes them feel and how much harder it would be to hear if there were distracting noises. This could lead to a discussion about distractions in our lives that keep us from hearing the still, small voice.\nThe scriptures describe the voice of the Spirit as a still, small voice.\nThus Saith the Still Small Voice\nDoctrine and Covenants 86\nDoctrine and Covenants 86 contains an interpretation of the parable of the wheat and the tares, found in Matthew 13:24–30, 37–43 .

What connections do you see between these themes and the parable of the wheat and the tares?\nWhat is your role in being a “light unto the Gentiles” and “a savior unto [the Lord’s] people”? ( verse 11 ).\nDoctrine and Covenants 87\nThe prophecy in section 87 warns about physical dangers related to war in the last days. But the counsel in this revelation also applies to spiritual dangers. Ponder questions such as the following:\nA prophecy is a revelation from God to a prophet, often about the future. What are some examples of prophecies that ancient and modern prophets have given? (see John 3:14 ; Mosiah 3:5 ; Helaman 14:2–6 ). How were they fulfilled? (see Luke 23:33 ; Matthew 15:30–31 ; 3 Nephi 1:15–21 ).\nWhat are the blessings of accepting the prophecies of God’s prophets?\nWith those thoughts in mind, read section 87 .

Why do you think He wants His Saints to keep a history? What could you record about your “manner of life, [your] faith, and works” that might be a blessing to you and future generations? How might keeping a personal history help you come unto Christ?\nSee also “ Journals: ‘Of Far More Worth than Gold ,’” Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff (2011), 125–33; “Turning Hearts” (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org .\nTurning Hearts\n## The Spirit speaks with a “still small voice.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 85:6\nPonder the words Joseph Smith used to describe the Spirit in Doctrine and Covenants 85:6 . In what sense is the Spirit’s voice “still” and “small”? Consider these additional descriptions given through Joseph Smith: Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–24 ; 8:2–3 ; 9:7–9 ; 11:12–13 ; 128:1 . How does the Spirit speak to you?\nSee also Luke 24:32 ; Mosiah 5:2 ; Alma 32:28 ; Helaman 5:30 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23 ; 11:12–13 .\nUse object lessons. People remember a gospel lesson better when they see or participate in an object lesson related to what they are learning. For example, when teaching about the still, small voice of the Spirit, maybe you could play a recording of soft, sacred music, and learners could talk about how the music makes them feel and how much harder it would be to hear if there were distracting noises. This could lead to a discussion about distractions in our lives that keep us from hearing the still, small voice.\nThe scriptures describe the voice of the Spirit as a still, small voice.\nThus Saith the Still Small Voice\n## The righteous are gathered to Christ in the last days.\nDoctrine and Covenants 86\nDoctrine and Covenants 86 contains an interpretation of the parable of the wheat and the tares, found in Matthew 13:24–30, 37–43 . As you learn about the meaning of this parable, consider filling out a table like this one:\nSymbols\nPossible meanings\nQuestions to ponder\nSymbols\nSowers of the seed\nPossible meanings\nProphets and apostles\nQuestions to ponder\nWhat kinds of “seeds” do prophets and apostles plant?\nSymbols\nThe enemy\nPossible meanings\nSatan\nQuestions to ponder\nHow does the adversary try to stop the Lord’s work?\nSymbols\nPossible meanings\nQuestions to ponder\nSymbols\nPossible meanings\nQuestions to ponder\nHere are a few additional questions to consider:\nAfter interpreting the parable, the Lord spoke of priesthood, restoration, and the salvation of His people (see verses 8–11 ). What connections do you see between these themes and the parable of the wheat and the tares?\nWhat is your role in being a “light unto the Gentiles” and “a savior unto [the Lord’s] people”? ( verse 11 ).\n## Peace is found in “holy places.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 87\nThe prophecy in section 87 warns about physical dangers related to war in the last days. But the counsel in this revelation also applies to spiritual dangers. Ponder questions such as the following:\nA prophecy is a revelation from God to a prophet, often about the future. What are some examples of prophecies that ancient and modern prophets have given? (see John 3:14 ; Mosiah 3:5 ; Helaman 14:2–6 ). How were they fulfilled? (see Luke 23:33 ; Matthew 15:30–31 ; 3 Nephi 1:15–21 ).\nWhat are the blessings of accepting the prophecies of God’s prophets?\nWith those thoughts in mind, read section 87 . (For some historical context, you might also want to read the introduction to this outline.) What do you learn about prophecy from this revelation and the way it was fulfilled? What would you say to someone who doubts a prophecy because it is not fulfilled right away?\nWhat counsel does the Lord give in verse 8 ? What are your “holy places” where you find peace and safety?

Invite them to read about one way Joseph Smith described the Spirit’s voice in Doctrine and Covenants 85:6 . They could then practice listening to and speaking in a small voice. You might also share experiences when the Spirit spoke to you in a still, small voice.\nTo help your children understand the phrase “still small voice,” you could play a children’s song quietly, such as “ The Holy Ghost ” ( Children’s Songbook , 105). Ask one of the children to guess what song it is while other children make distracting noises. Then you could repeat the song with no distractions. What distractions can we remove from our lives to feel the Spirit more often?\nDoctrine and Covenants 86\nTo help your children understand the parable described in section 86 , you could prepare several small pictures or drawings of wheat and hide them around the room. Explain to your children the parable of the wheat and the tares (see Matthew 13:24–30 ), and read together the Lord’s commentary in Doctrine and Covenants 86:1–7 . Your children could then gather the hidden pictures of wheat and write on them the name of someone they can “gather” to Jesus Christ. What does it mean to gather people to Jesus Christ? What are some ways we can do this?\nDoctrine and Covenants 86:11\nHere are some questions you can ask your children as you discuss Doctrine and Covenants 86:11 : How does light bless us? What is it like when we have no light? How can we be a light to other people? Help your children think of ways we can “continue in [Jesus’s] goodness” and share it with others.\nDoctrine and Covenants 87:6, 8\nRead together Doctrine and Covenants 87:6 to learn about things the Lord said would happen in the latter days. Then you could talk about some of the challenges you and your children face. In verse 8 , what did the Lord say we can do during hard times?\nHelp your children make a list of holy places, holy thoughts, and holy actions that can help them face spiritual danger.

Her consecration to the Lord, which included donations she had made earlier in Kirtland, came at a crucial time for the Church, when leaders were trying to purchase the land where the Kirtland Temple would be built. Vienna was “faithful, and not … idle” throughout her life and was eventually able to “settle down in peace” ( verse 31 ) in the Salt Lake Valley, where she died at age 96.\nDoctrine and Covenants 91\nWe all encounter messages that contain “many things … that are true” and “many things … that are not true” ( Doctrine and Covenants 91:1–2 ).

Monson, “ Principles and Promises ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2016, 78–79; Topics and Questions, “ Word of Wisdom ,” Gospel Library; “ The Word of Wisdom ,” in Revelations in Context , 183–91; “ Addiction ,” “ Physical Health ,” Life Help, Gospel Library.\nPrinciples and Promises\nLearn and teach through principles. Rather than creating lists of dos and don’ts, we can live by principles to exercise our agency and faith in Christ. For example, consider principle-based questions like these regarding the Word of Wisdom: Which principles can give encouragement to someone who struggles to obey the Word of Wisdom? Which principles can comfort me when I have health problems despite living the Word of Wisdom?\nHeavenly Father wants us to take care of our bodies.\n## The First Presidency holds the “keys of the kingdom.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:1–17\nIn section 90 , the Lord gave instructions about “the ministry and presidency” ( verse 12 ) of Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams—members of what we now call the First Presidency. What do you learn about the First Presidency from verses 1–17 ? Consider reviewing recent messages from members of the First Presidency. What do they do to “set in order all the affairs of this church and kingdom”? ( verse 16 ). How can you show that they are not “a light thing” to you? ( verse 5 ).\nConsider singing or reading the words to “ Come, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice ” ( Hymns , no. 21) or another song about prophets that relates to teachings in these verses. How has the service of the First Presidency helped you know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\n## “All things shall work together for [my] good.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:24\nPonder any experiences you have had that testify of the Lord’s promise in Doctrine and Covenants 90:24 . Consider recording your experiences and sharing them with a family member or loved one—maybe someone who needs reassurance or encouragement. If you are still waiting for certain blessings, ponder what you can do to remain faithful as you wait to see how “all things shall work together for your good.”\nAll Things for Our Good\n## Who was Vienna Jaques?\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:28–31\nVienna Jaques was born on June 10, 1787, in Massachusetts. A woman of faith who had considerable financial means, Vienna first met missionaries in 1831. After obtaining a spiritual witness that their message was true, she traveled to meet the Prophet in Kirtland, Ohio, where she was baptized.\nVienna obeyed the Lord’s counsel to her in Doctrine and Covenants 90:28–31 . Her consecration to the Lord, which included donations she had made earlier in Kirtland, came at a crucial time for the Church, when leaders were trying to purchase the land where the Kirtland Temple would be built. Vienna was “faithful, and not … idle” throughout her life and was eventually able to “settle down in peace” ( verse 31 ) in the Salt Lake Valley, where she died at age 96.\n## “The Spirit manifesteth truth.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 91\nWe all encounter messages that contain “many things … that are true” and “many things … that are not true” ( Doctrine and Covenants 91:1–2 ). What counsel do you find in section 91 that can help you discern truth in the messages you encounter? How has the Spirit helped you discern truth from error?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 89\nTo introduce section 89 , perhaps you and your children could look at a picture of a temple or sing a song about physical health, such as “ The Lord Gave Me a Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 153), to teach that our bodies are like temples for our spirits. Help your children act out ways they can care for their bodies.\nTo learn about the Lord’s commandments in Doctrine and Covenants 89:10–17 , you and your children could draw or look at pictures of good things we can eat or do to keep our bodies healthy (see the picture and activity page at the end of this outline). What has the Lord warned us not to use? Why does He want us to care for our bodies?\nThe Word of Wisdom: The Lord's law of health\nElder Gary E. Stevenson counseled young people to plan in advance what they will do when tempted with alcohol or drugs. He taught: “You will find that temptation has less control over you. You will have already made the decision of how you will react and what you will do. You won’t need to decide every time” (“ Your Priesthood Playbook ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 48). After reading together Doctrine and Covenants 89:4 and Elder Stevenson’s statement, counsel with your children about how they can decide now—for the rest of their lives—to live the Word of Wisdom. You could even role-play how they might respond if someone, even a friend, offers them something that is against the Word of Wisdom. How does the Lord bless us as we obey the Word of Wisdom? ( see verses 18–21 ).\nOur bodies are gifts from God.\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:5\nYou could look at pictures of ancient prophets or sing a song like “ Follow the Prophet ” ( Children’s Songbook , 110–11). How has God blessed His children through His prophets? Why should we listen to God’s prophets? (see Doctrine and Covenants 90:5 ). Then you and your children could look at a picture of the living prophet and share some things the Lord has taught or warned us about through him. How can we follow the prophet?\nDoctrine and Covenants 91\nYou could summarize the section heading for Doctrine and Covenants 91 to help your children understand why this revelation was given. They could then think of places, such as in the media, where we find “many things … that are true” and “many things … that are not true” ( verses 1–2 ).

For each truth you choose, you could give your children a word or phrase to listen for as you read the verse together. For example, Jesus Christ:\nDid the works of the Father ( verse 5 ).\nIs the Light of the World ( verse 9 ).\nIs the Creator of the world ( verse 10 ).\nReceived all power in heaven and on earth ( verse 17 ).\nWas with God in the beginning ( verse 21 ).\nChapter 33: A Revelation about Jesus Christ: May 1833\nDetail from Light of the World , by Howard Lyon\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:23, 29, 38\nThe Savior emphasized three times in section 93 that we lived with God “in the beginning” ( verses 23, 29, 38 ). To help your children discover this, you could invite them to read Doctrine and Covenants 93:23, 29, 38 and look for a truth about themselves that is repeated in these verses. Why does Heavenly Father want us to know this truth? You might also ask your children what they know about our life with Heavenly Father before we were born. To help them learn more, read with them one or more of the following scripture passages: Jeremiah 1:5 ; Doctrine and Covenants 138:53–56 ; Moses 3:5 ; Abraham 3:22–26 .\nYou could also sing together “ I Am a Child of God ” or “ I Lived in Heaven ” ( Children’s Songbook , 2–3, 4) and discuss truths we learn from these songs about our purpose for coming to earth.\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:24–39\nTo help your children apply the truths about obedience in Doctrine and Covenants 93 , consider writing a few scripture references from this section on pieces of paper. On different pieces of paper, write the truths that each of these verses teaches. Your children could work together to read the verses and match the truths to the scripture references. Examples could include:\nVerse 24 : Truth is knowing things that are real in the past, present, and future.\nVerse 28 : I can receive light and truth as I keep the commandments.\nVerse 37 : When I have light and truth, I am able to resist evil.\nVerse 39 : I lose light and truth when I am disobedient.\nYou may want to share examples of truths you have come to know as you have kept the commandments of the Lord.\nAdapt to the ages of your children.

What impresses you about what the Lord says about these buildings in Doctrine and Covenants 94:2–12 ? How does it compare with what He says about the temple in 97:10–17 ?\nWhat does it mean to you to be “wholly dedicated unto the Lord”?\nDoctrine and Covenants 95\nWhen the revelation in section 95 was received, about five months had passed since the Lord commanded the Saints to build a house of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:117–19 )—and they hadn’t started yet. Notice how the Lord corrected them in this revelation. You might even make a list of principles you find for giving inspired correction. What do you learn about the Lord from the way He corrected His Saints?\nSee also Doctrine and Covenants 121:43–44 ; D. Todd Christofferson, “ As Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2011, 97–100.\nGod Loves His Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8, 11–17 ; 97:10–17\nAfter being chastised for not building a house of the Lord in Kirtland, Church leaders chose a site in a wheat field where they would build. Hyrum Smith, the Prophet’s brother, immediately ran to get a scythe to begin clearing the field. “We are preparing to build a house for the Lord,” he said, “and I am determined to be the first at the work” (in Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 271, 273 ). Why do you think Hyrum was so eager to build the temple? Ponder this as you read Doctrine and Covenants 95:8, 11–17 ; 97:10–17 .\nIn our day, the Lord “is accelerating the pace at which we are building temples” (Russell M. Nelson, “ Focus on the Temple ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 121). If someone asked you why the Church of Jesus Christ builds so many temples, what would you say? Look for possible answers in:\nPresident Russell M. Nelson’s messages announcing new temples (such as “ Now Is the Time ,” Liahona , May 2022, 126).\n“ Why Latter-day Saints Build Temples ” ( temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ).\nThe video “Temples” (Gospel Library).\nWhat Is a Temple?\nYou might compare the Saints’ efforts to build the Kirtland Temple to your efforts to prepare for meaningful experiences with the Lord in the temple. How can you show the same sense of urgency that Hyrum Smith felt toward the Lord’s holy house? For example, what could you do that would be like clearing the field, as Hyrum did? What sacrifices do you feel the Lord wants you to make?

How is that similar to or different from what Doctrine and Covenants 97:8–9 teaches about what it means to be accepted of the Lord? What do you think the Lord is trying to teach you with the metaphor in verse 9 ?\nSee also Erich W. Kopischke, “ Being Accepted of the Lord ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2013, 104–6.\nCreate a spiritual environment for learning and teaching. “The Holy Ghost,” Jesus promised, “shall teach you all things” ( John 14:26 ). So whether you’re learning on your own or with others, make it a priority to invite the Spirit. Sacred music, prayer, and loving interactions can all help create a peaceful, spiritual setting where the Holy Ghost can teach you truth.\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:18–28\nTo the Saints in the 1830s, Zion was a place. In the revelation in section 97 , the Lord expanded the definition to describe a people—“the pure in heart” ( verse 21 ). As you read verses 18–28 , you could substitute this definition when you read the word Zion .

What impresses you about what the Lord says about these buildings in Doctrine and Covenants 94:2–12 ? How does it compare with what He says about the temple in 97:10–17 ?\nWhat does it mean to you to be “wholly dedicated unto the Lord”?\n## The Lord chastens those He loves.\nDoctrine and Covenants 95\nWhen the revelation in section 95 was received, about five months had passed since the Lord commanded the Saints to build a house of God (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:117–19 )—and they hadn’t started yet. Notice how the Lord corrected them in this revelation. You might even make a list of principles you find for giving inspired correction. What do you learn about the Lord from the way He corrected His Saints?\nSee also Doctrine and Covenants 121:43–44 ; D. Todd Christofferson, “ As Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2011, 97–100.\nGod Loves His Children\n## The temple is the house of the Lord.\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8, 11–17 ; 97:10–17\nAfter being chastised for not building a house of the Lord in Kirtland, Church leaders chose a site in a wheat field where they would build. Hyrum Smith, the Prophet’s brother, immediately ran to get a scythe to begin clearing the field. “We are preparing to build a house for the Lord,” he said, “and I am determined to be the first at the work” (in Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 271, 273 ). Why do you think Hyrum was so eager to build the temple? Ponder this as you read Doctrine and Covenants 95:8, 11–17 ; 97:10–17 .\nIn our day, the Lord “is accelerating the pace at which we are building temples” (Russell M. Nelson, “ Focus on the Temple ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 121). If someone asked you why the Church of Jesus Christ builds so many temples, what would you say? Look for possible answers in:\nPresident Russell M. Nelson’s messages announcing new temples (such as “ Now Is the Time ,” Liahona , May 2022, 126).\n“ Why Latter-day Saints Build Temples ” ( temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org ).\nThe video “Temples” (Gospel Library).\nWhat Is a Temple?\nYou might compare the Saints’ efforts to build the Kirtland Temple to your efforts to prepare for meaningful experiences with the Lord in the temple. How can you show the same sense of urgency that Hyrum Smith felt toward the Lord’s holy house? For example, what could you do that would be like clearing the field, as Hyrum did? What sacrifices do you feel the Lord wants you to make? (see Doctrine and Covenants 97:12 ).\nSee also “ Holy Temples on Mount Zion ,” Hymns , no. 289; Topics and Questions, “ Temples ,” Gospel Library.\nHyrum Smith clearing land for the Kirtland Temple.\n## “They are accepted of me.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:8–9\nThink about a time when you were accepted—or not accepted—into a group or team. How is that similar to or different from what Doctrine and Covenants 97:8–9 teaches about what it means to be accepted of the Lord? What do you think the Lord is trying to teach you with the metaphor in verse 9 ?\nSee also Erich W. Kopischke, “ Being Accepted of the Lord ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2013, 104–6.\n## Zion is “the pure in heart.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:18–28\nTo the Saints in the 1830s, Zion was a place. In the revelation in section 97 , the Lord expanded the definition to describe a people—“the pure in heart” ( verse 21 ). As you read verses 18–28 , you could substitute this definition when you read the word Zion .

Your children might enjoy pretending they are helping to build the Kirtland Temple (cutting wood, hammering nails, painting walls, and so on).

What truths do you find in Doctrine and Covenants 103:5–7, 12–13, 36 ; 105:1–6, 9–19 that could help?\nThen you might think about a more modern example of a trial like Zion’s Camp—such as a missionary who works hard, but no one joins the Church because of his or her efforts. Based on what you’ve studied, how would you help that missionary see that his or her mission was still successful?\nHow has the Lord blessed you “after much tribulation”? ( Doctrine and Covenants 103:12 ).\nSee also 1 Nephi 11:16–17 ; Alma 7:11–12 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:33–36 ; 84:88 ; 101:35–36 ; David A.

Whitney’s counsel about the purpose of trials: “No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God … and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven” (in Spencer W. Kimball, Faith Precedes the Miracle [1972], 98).\n## The Lord has made me a “steward over earthly blessings.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 104:11–18, 78–83\nIn addition to trials in Missouri, in 1834 the Church faced financial difficulties, including heavy debts and expenses. In section 104 the Lord gave counsel on the Church’s financial situation. How can you apply the principles in verses 11–18 and 78–83 to your own financial decisions?\nSee also “Treasure in Heaven: The John Tanner Story” and “The Labor of His Hands” (videos), Gospel Library.\nTreasure in Heaven: The John Tanner Story\nThe Labor of His Hands\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Lyman Wight\nZion’s Camp (Camp of Israel)\nChurch Discipline\nClick to see more\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 103:9\nYou could invite your children to hold pictures of a light bulb, a candle, or another source of light while you read Doctrine and Covenants 103:9 .

  38a-voices-of-the-restoration-zions-camp,Voices of the Restoration,"","","## Zion’s Camp\nBecause Zion’s Camp never restored the Saints to their lands in Jackson County, many people felt that their endeavor was a failure. However, many participants of Zion’s Camp looked back on their experience and saw how the Lord fulfilled a higher purpose in their lives and in His kingdom. Here are some of their testimonies.\nOver 40 years after Zion’s Camp, Joseph Young, who had been a member of the camp, reported that Joseph Smith said the following:\n“Brethren, some of you are angry with me, because you did not fight in Missouri; but let me tell you, God did not want you to fight. He could not organize his kingdom with twelve men to open the gospel door to the nations of the earth, and with seventy men under their direction to follow in their tracks, unless he took them from a body of men who had offered their lives, and who had made as great a sacrifice as did Abraham.\n“Now, the Lord has got his Twelve and his Seventy, and there will be other quorums of Seventies called, who will make the sacrifice, and those who have not made their sacrifices and their offerings now, will make them hereafter.”\n“When we arrived in Missouri the Lord spoke to his servant Joseph and said, ‘I have accepted your offering,’ and we had the privilege to return again. On my return many friends asked me what profit there was in calling men from their labor to go up to Missouri and then return, without apparently accomplishing anything. ‘Who has it benefited?’ asked they. ‘If the Lord did command it to be done, what object had he in view in doing so?’ … I told those brethren that I was well paid—paid with heavy interest—yea that my measure was filled to overflowing with the knowledge that I had received by traveling with the Prophet.”\n“I was in Zion’s Camp with the Prophet of God. I saw the dealings of God with him. I saw the power of God with him. I saw that he was a Prophet. What was manifest to him by the power of God upon that mission was of great value to me and to all who received his instructions.”\n“When the members of Zion’s Camp were called many of us had never beheld each others’ faces; we were strangers to each other and many had never seen the prophet. We had been scattered abroad, like corn sifted in a sieve, throughout the nation. We were young men, and were called upon in that early day to go up and redeem Zion, and what we had to do we had to do by faith. We assembled together from the various States at Kirtland and went up to redeem Zion, in fulfilment of the commandment of God unto us. God accepted our works as He did the works of Abraham. We accomplished a great deal, though apostates and unbelievers many times asked the question ‘what have you done?’ We gained an experience that we never could have gained [in] any other way. We had the privilege of beholding the face of the prophet, and we had the privilege of traveling a thousand miles with him, and seeing the workings of the spirit of God with him, and the revelations of Jesus Christ unto him and the fulfilment of those revelations. And he gathered some two hundred elders from throughout the nation in that early day and sent us broadcast into the world to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. Had I not gone up with Zion’s Camp I should not have been here to-day [in Salt Lake City, serving in the Quorum of the Twelve]. … By going there we were thrust into the vineyard to preach the gospel, and the Lord accepted our labors. And in all our labors and persecutions, with our lives often at stake, we have had to work and live by faith.”\n“The experience [we] obtained in travelling in Zion’s Camp was of more worth than gold.”\n## Joseph Smith\nOver 40 years after Zion’s Camp, Joseph Young, who had been a member of the camp, reported that Joseph Smith said the following:\n“Brethren, some of you are angry with me, because you did not fight in Missouri; but let me tell you, God did not want you to fight.

I saw the dealings of God with him. I saw the power of God with him. I saw that he was a Prophet. What was manifest to him by the power of God upon that mission was of great value to me and to all who received his instructions.”\n“When the members of Zion’s Camp were called many of us had never beheld each others’ faces; we were strangers to each other and many had never seen the prophet.

Many compared their experiences to what the ancient Saints experienced when they were “endued with power from on high” on the day of Pentecost ( Luke 24:49 ; see also Acts 2:1–4 ; Doctrine and Covenants 109:36–37 ).\n“The ceremonies of that dedication may be rehearsed, but no mortal language can describe the heavenly manifestations of that memorable day. Angels appeared to some, while a sense of divine presence was realized by all present, and each heart was filled with ‘joy inexpressible and full of glory.’”\n“One of my earliest recollections was the dedication of the Temple. My father took us up on his lap and told us why we were going and what it meant to dedicate a house to God. And although so very young at the time, I clearly remember the occasion. I can look back through the lapse of years and see as I saw then Joseph the Prophet, standing with his hands raised towards heaven, his face ashy pale, the tears running down his cheeks as he spoke on that memorable day. Almost all seemed to be in tears. The house was so crowded the children were mostly sitting on older people’s laps; my sister sat on father’s, I on my mother’s lap. I can even remember the dresses we wore. My mind was too young at that time to grasp the full significance of it all, but as time passed it dawned more and more upon me, and I am very grateful that I was privileged to be there.”\n“In the evening I met with the officers of the church in the Lord’s house. The Spirit was poured out—I saw the glory of God, like a great cloud, come down and rest upon the house, and fill the same like a mighty rushing wind. I also saw cloven tongues, like as of fire rest upon many, … while they spake with other tongues and prophesied.”\n“Many visions [were] seen. One saw a pillow or cloud rest down upon the house, bright as when the sun shines on a cloud like as gold. Two others saw three personages hovering in the room with bright keys in their hands, and also a bright chain in their hands.”\n“God was there, his angels were there, the Holy Ghost was in the midst of the people … and they were filled from the crown of their heads to the soles of their feet with the power and inspiration of the Holy Ghost.”\n“[When] the Temple was finished and dedicated … they were two of the happiest days of my life. The fitting hymn that was composed for the occasion was ‘The Spirit of God Like a Fire is Burning.’ It was verily true that the Heavenly Influence rested down upon that house. … I felt that it was heaven on earth.”\n## Eliza R.

Joseph Smith and others worried about these debts and considered ways to pay them (see the section heading to Doctrine and Covenants 111 ).\nAs you read section 111 , consider how the Lord’s words to Joseph may apply to you—and the things you worry about. For example, when have you felt God’s love “notwithstanding your follies” ( verse 1 )? How has the Lord helped you find unexpected “treasures” ( verse 10 )? What has He done to “order all things for your good” ( verse 11 )? What does the phrase “as fast as ye are able to receive them” teach you about Heavenly Father?\nSee also Matthew 6:19–21, 33 ; “ More Treasures Than One ,” in Revelations in Context , 229–34.\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:3–15, 22\nThomas B. Marsh, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was upset that Joseph Smith had, without consulting him, called two members of his quorum to preach the gospel in England. He met with the Prophet, who received a revelation that helped Thomas put aside his hurt feelings. That revelation is recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 112 .\nKeep this context in mind as you study Doctrine and Covenants 112 . What do you find that might have healed Thomas’s hurt feelings? In verses 3–15 and 22 , you could look for answers to questions like these: What is humility? What does it mean for the Lord to lead you “by the hand”? Why do you think being humble helps you receive the Lord’s guidance? You could find additional answers in “ Pattern of Humility ” in Elder Joseph W. Sitati’s message “ Patterns of Discipleship ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2022, 87–88).\nThink of someone you know who is humble. What does this person do to show humility?

Think about how you can help the people you teach to actively participate in learning the truths in the scriptures.

What can we learn about humility from this demonstration?\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:12–26, 28, 33–34\nThe fact that some Apostles in 1837 turned against the Prophet is a good reminder that regardless of our Church calling or how much we know about the gospel, we must individually make sure we nourish our conversion to Jesus Christ. Perhaps you could read Doctrine and Covenants 112:12–26, 28, 33–34 and look for truths that could help you overcome a trial of faith or become more fully converted to the Lord. You might feel inspired to share what you find to help someone else strengthen their conversion to Christ.\nDoctrine and Covenants 113\nThe prophet Isaiah referred to one of Jesse’s descendants as a “rod” and a “root” ( Isaiah 11:1, 10 ). In section 113 , the Lord explained that this descendant, a servant of Christ, would be instrumental in gathering the Lord’s people in the last days (see Doctrine and Covenants 113:4, 6 ). This prophecy describes the Prophet Joseph Smith quite well. How might this and other truths in section 113 have encouraged the Saints during the turmoil they experienced in Kirtland?

Why do we need the Lord to lead us? When have we felt the Lord leading us?\nYou or your children could write the words of Doctrine and Covenants 112:10 and underline the blessings the Lord gives us when we humbly turn to Him. Encourage your children to share times when they humbly asked for the Lord’s help and received answers to their prayers or were led to do something good (see Moroni 7:13, 16 ).\nDetail from Arise and Walk , by Simon Dewey\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:11\nYou and your children could take turns reading from “ Chapter 41: Trouble in Kirtland ” (in Doctrine and Covenants Stories , 158–60). Who in the story made the problems in Kirtland worse? Who was trying to make them better? Then you could read Doctrine and Covenants 112:11 and talk about why the Savior wants us to love everyone. When did He show love for people who were unkind to Him? (for example, see Luke 23:34 ). You could also sing a song about loving others, such as “ I’ll Walk with You ” ( Children’s Songbook , 140–41).\nParley Asks for Forgiveness: A friend's testimony builds his faith\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:11–14, 24–26\nAfter reading Doctrine and Covenants 112:24–26 , you and your children could talk about the difference between knowing someone’s name and knowing them.

Encourage your children to share times when they humbly asked for the Lord’s help and received answers to their prayers or were led to do something good (see Moroni 7:13, 16 ).\nDetail from Arise and Walk , by Simon Dewey\n## Jesus wants me to love everyone.\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:11\nYou and your children could take turns reading from “ Chapter 41: Trouble in Kirtland ” (in Doctrine and Covenants Stories , 158–60). Who in the story made the problems in Kirtland worse? Who was trying to make them better? Then you could read Doctrine and Covenants 112:11 and talk about why the Savior wants us to love everyone. When did He show love for people who were unkind to Him? (for example, see Luke 23:34 ). You could also sing a song about loving others, such as “ I’ll Walk with You ” ( Children’s Songbook , 140–41).\nParley Asks for Forgiveness: A friend's testimony builds his faith\n## Those who are truly converted come to know Jesus Christ.\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:11–14, 24–26\nAfter reading Doctrine and Covenants 112:24–26 , you and your children could talk about the difference between knowing someone’s name and knowing them.

  43a-voices-of-the-restoration-liberty-jail,Voices of the Restoration,"","","## Liberty Jail\nWhile imprisoned in Liberty, Missouri, Joseph Smith received letters informing him about the perilous situation of the Latter-day Saints who were being driven from the state by the order of the governor. A poignant letter came from his wife Emma. Her words, and Joseph’s letters in response, express both their sufferings and their faith during this difficult time in Church history.\nJoseph Smith and others were held in this jail in the winter of 1838–39.\nDear Husband\nHaving an opportunity to send by a friend, I make an attempt to write, but I shall not attempt to write my feelings altogether, for the situation in which you are, the walls, bars, and bolts, rolling rivers, running streams, rising hills, sinking valleys and spreading prairies that separate us, and the cruel injustice that first cast you into prison and still holds you there, with many other considerations, places my feelings far beyond description.\nWas it not for conscious innocence, and the direct interposition of divine mercy, I am very sure I never should have been able to have endured the scenes of suffering that I have passed through … ; but I still live and am yet willing to suffer more if it is the will of kind Heaven that I should for your sake.\nWe are all well at present, except Fredrick who is quite sick.\nLittle Alexander who is now in my arms is one of the finest little fellows you ever saw in your life. He is so strong that with the assistance of a chair he will run all round the room. …\nNo one but God knows the reflections of my mind and the feelings of my heart when I left our house and home, and almost all of everything that we possessed excepting our little Children, and took my journey out of the state of Missouri, leaving you shut up in that lonesome prison. But the recollection is more than human nature ought to bear. …\n… I hope there are better days to come to us yet. … [I] am ever yours affectionately.\nEmma Smith\nDear—and affectionate—Wife.\nThursday night I sat down just as the sun is going down, as we peek through the grates of this lonesome prison, to write to you, that I may make known to you my situation. It is I believe now about five months and six days since I have been under the grimace of a guard night and day, and within the walls, grates, and screeking iron doors of a lonesome, dark, dirty prison. With emotions known only to God do I write this letter. The contemplations of the mind under these circumstances defies the pen, or tongue, or Angels, to describe, or paint, to the human being who never experienced what we experience. … We lean on the arm of Jehovah, and none else, for our deliverance, and if he doesn’t do it, it will not be done, you may be assured, for there is great thirsting for our blood in this state; not because we are guilty of anything. … My Dear Emma, I think of you and the children continually. … I want to see little Frederick, Joseph, Julia, Alexander, Joana, and old major [the family dog]. … I would gladly walk from here to you barefoot, and bareheaded, and half naked, to see you and think it great pleasure, and never count it toil. … I bear with fortitude all my oppression, so do those that are with me; not one of us have flinched yet. I want you [to] not let [our children] forget me.

  44a-voices-of-the-restoration-the-relief-society,Voices of the Restoration,"","2 John 1:1,Doctrine and Covenants 25:3","## The Relief Society\nIn 1842, after the Relief Society was organized in Nauvoo, Illinois, the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “The Church was never perfectly organized until the women were thus organized.” Similarly, a study of the Restoration of the Lord’s Church and His priesthood is not complete until it includes a study of the Relief Society, which itself is “a restoration of an ancient pattern” of female disciples of Jesus Christ.\nEliza R. Snow played an important role in that restoration. She was present when the Relief Society was first organized and, as the society’s secretary, took notes during its meetings. She witnessed firsthand that the Relief Society was organized “after the pattern of the priesthood.” Below are her words, written while she was serving as the second General President of the Relief Society, to help her sisters understand the divine work entrusted to the covenant daughters of God.\nTo learn more about how the Relief Society was organized, see Daughters in My Kingdom: The History and Work of Relief Society (2017), 1–25 ; The First Fifty Years of Relief Society (2016), 3–175 .\nPainting of the Relief Society organization by Paul Mann\n“Although the name [Relief Society] may be of modern date, the institution is of ancient origin. We were told by [Joseph Smith], that the same organization existed in the church anciently, allusions to which are made in some of the epistles recorded in the New Testament, making use of the title, ‘elect lady’ [see 2 John 1:1 ; Doctrine and Covenants 25:3 ].\n“This is an organization that cannot exist without the Priesthood, from the fact that it derives all its authority and influence from that source. When the Priesthood was taken from the earth, this institution as well as every other appendage of the true order of the church of Jesus Christ on the earth, became extinct. …\n“Having been present at the organization of the ‘Female Relief Society of Nauvoo,’ … also having had considerable experience in that association, perhaps I may communicate a few hints that will assist the daughters of Zion in stepping forth in this very important position, which is replete with new and multiplied responsibilities. If any of the daughters and mothers in Israel are feeling in the least circumscribed in their present spheres, they will now find ample scope for every power and capability for doing good with which they are most liberally endowed. …\nThe Relief Society was organized in the upstairs room of the Red Brick Store.\n“Should the question arise in the mind, of any, What is the object of the Female Relief Society? I would reply—to do good—to bring into requisition every capacity we possess for doing good, not only in relieving the poor but in saving souls. United effort will accomplish incalculably more than can be accomplished by the most effective individual energies. …\n“In administering to the poor, the Female Relief Society has other duties to perform than merely relieving bodily wants. Poverty of mind and sickness of heart, also demand attention; and many times a kind expression—a few words of counsel, or even a warm and affectionate shake of the hand will do more good and be better appreciated than a purse of gold. …\n“When the Saints gather from abroad, strangers to everybody, and subject to be led astray by those who lie in wait to deceive, the [Relief] Society should be prompt in looking after [them], and introduce them into the society that will refine and elevate, and above all strengthen them in the faith of the Gospel, and in so doing, may be instrumental in saving many.\n“It would require volumes in which to define the duties, privileges and responsibilities that come within the purview of the Society. … Go at it (under the direction of your bishop) coolly, deliberately, energetically, unitedly and prayerfully, and God will crown your efforts with success.”\n## Eliza R.

He was asked to “take especial care of [his] family” ( verse 3 ), who had suffered in his absence. As you study this section, consider why the Lord sometimes requires sacrifice in our service. What can you do to take care of your family?\nSee also “ Take Special Care of Your Family ,” in Revelations in Context , 242–49.\nDoctrine and Covenants 127:2–4\nFalse accusations and the threat of arrest had again forced Joseph Smith into hiding in August 1842. And yet the words he wrote to the Saints during this time (now Doctrine and Covenants 127 ) are full of optimism and joy. What do verses 2–4 teach you about God? about facing ridicule or opposition? What phrases from these verses might help you when you feel persecuted? Consider recording how the Lord is sustaining you in the “deep water” of your life.\nDoctrine and Covenants 127:5–8 ; 128:1–8\nAs you read Doctrine and Covenants 127:5–8 ; 128:1–8 , look for reasons the Lord gave Joseph Smith such specific instructions about recording baptisms for the dead. What does this teach you about the Lord and His work? How do you feel this instruction could apply to your own family records, such as personal journals?\nDoing temple service for our ancestors binds our hearts to them.\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:5–25\nIt’s clear from what God revealed through Joseph Smith why our ancestors who weren’t baptized in this life need us: we are baptized on their behalf so they can choose to accept or reject this ordinance. But the Prophet also taught that our ancestors’ salvation is “necessary and essential to our salvation.” As you read Doctrine and Covenants 128:15–18 , think about why that is.\nVerse 5 teaches that the ordinance of baptism for the dead was “prepared before the foundation of the world.” What does this truth teach you about God and His plan? What does Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “ Family History and Temple Work: Sealing and Healing ” add to your understanding? ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 46–49).\nJoseph Smith used phrases like “binding power,” “welding link,” and “perfect union” when teaching about priesthood ordinances and baptism for the dead. Look for these and similar phrases as you read Doctrine and Covenants 128:5–25 . Can you think of objects you could use to illustrate these phrases, such as a chain or rope?

  45a-voices-of-the-restoration-baptism-for-our-ancestors,Voices of the Restoration,"",first Corinthians 15th chapter 29th verse,"## Baptism for Our Ancestors, “a Glorious Doctrine”\nThis sketch shows the baptismal font of the Nauvoo Temple resting on twelve oxen.\nPhebe Woodruff was living near Nauvoo when Joseph Smith began teaching about the possibility of being baptized for those who lived previously. She wrote about it to her husband, Wilford, who was serving a mission in England:\n“Brother Joseph … has learned by revelation that those in this church may be baptized for any of their relatives who are dead and had not a privilege of hearing this gospel, even for their children, parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, uncles, and aunts. … As soon as they are baptized for their friends they are released from prison and they can claim them in the resurrection and bring them into the celestial kingdom—this doctrine is cordially received by the church and they are going forward in multitudes, some are going to be baptized as many as 16 times … in one day.”\nWilford Woodruff later said of this principle: “The moment I heard of it my soul leaped with joy. … I went forward and was baptised for all my dead relatives I could think of. … I felt to say hallelujah when the revelation came forth revealing to us baptism for the dead. I felt that we had a right to rejoice in the blessings of Heaven.”\nLike Sister Woodruff, Vilate Kimball heard about vicarious baptism while her husband, Heber, was away preaching the gospel. She wrote to him:\n“President Smith has opened a new and glorious subject … which has caused quite a revival in the church. That is, being baptised for the dead. Paul speaks of it, in first Corinthians 15th chapter 29th verse . Joseph has received a more full explanation of it by Revelation. … It is the privilege of this church to be baptised for all their kinsfolks that have died before this Gospel came forth; even back to their great-Grandfather and Mother. … By so doing, we act as agents for them; and give them the privilege of coming forth in the first resurrection. He says they will have the Gospel preached to them … but there is no such thing as spirits being baptised. … Since this order has been preached here, the waters have been continually troubled. During conference there were sometimes from eight to ten Elders in the river at a time baptising. … I want to be baptised for my Mother. I calculated to wait until you come home, but the last time Joseph spoke upon the subject, he advised every one to be up and a doing, and liberate their friends from bondage as quick as possible. So I think I shall go forward this week, as there is a number of the neighbors going forward. Some have already been baptised a number of times over. … Thus you see there is a chance for all. Is not this a glorious doctrine?”\nOnce the baptismal font was completed in the Nauvoo Temple, vicarious baptisms were performed there instead of in the river. Phebe Chase, a resident of Nauvoo, wrote to her mother about the temple, describing the baptismal font as the place where “we can be baptised for our dead and become saviors on Mount Zion.” She went on to explain that in this font, “I have been baptised for my dear father and all the rest of my dead friends. … Now I want to know what your father’s and Mother’s names are so that I can release them, for I desire to relieve the Dead. … The Lord has spoken again and restored the ancient order.”\nIn writing to her friends and family about baptism for family members who lived previously, Sally Randall recalled the passing of her son George:\n“Oh what a trying time that was to me and it seems yet that I can not be reconciled to have it so, but … his father has been baptised for him and what a glorious thing it is that we believe and receive the fulness of the gospel as it is preached now and can be baptized for all of our dead friends and save them as far back as we can get any knowledge of them.\n“I want you should write me the given names of all of our connections that are dead as far back as grandfathers and grandmothers at any rate. I intend to do what I can to save my friends and I should be very glad if some of you would come and help me for it is a great work for one to do alone. … I expect you will think this is a strange doctrine but you will find it to be true.”\n## Phebe and Wilford Woodruff\nPhebe Woodruff was living near Nauvoo when Joseph Smith began teaching about the possibility of being baptized for those who lived previously.

For example, you could ask them to give you directions to walk somewhere, like to a school or Church building. What happens when we don’t follow the directions? Then you could read Doctrine and Covenants 130:21 and compare these directions to the commandments God has given us.\nYou might also sing together a song about obedience, such as “ Keep the Commandments ” ( Children’s Songbook , 146–47), and look for words in Doctrine and Covenants 130:20–21 and 132:5 that are similar to those in the song. How does God bless us as we strive to keep His commandments?\n## Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have immortal physical bodies.\nDoctrine and Covenants 130:22\nAfter reading Doctrine and Covenants 130:22 together, you and your children could look at a picture of Jesus Christ and point to His eyes, His mouth, and other parts of His body. Your children could point to those same parts of their own bodies. Tell them why it’s important to you to know that our bodies look like Heavenly Father’s and Jesus’s bodies.\nBecause of the ordinances of the Lord’s house, families can be eternal.\n## Heavenly Father made it possible for families to be together forever.\nDoctrine and Covenants 132:19\nHelp your children find examples of things that do not last forever—food that spoils, flowers that wilt, and so on. Then look at Doctrine and Covenants 132:19 together and find key phrases like “everlasting covenant,” “sealed,” “through all eternity,” and “forever and ever.” (See also “ Chapter 55: A Revelation about Marriage ,” in Doctrine and Covenants Stories , 198, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library.) You could also look at pictures of your family and testify that the Lord has made it possible, through the ordinances and covenants of the temple, for families to last forever.\nEternal Marriage and Families\nBe sensitive to family situations. “Children today find themselves in many different and complex family configurations. … [We] need to reach out to [those] who feel alone, left behind, or outside the fence” (Neil L. Andersen, “ Whoso Receiveth Them, Receiveth Me ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 49, 52)."

They could sing a song like “ To Be a Pioneer ” ( Children’s Songbook , 218–19) as they walk.\nLeaving Nauvoo and Going West\nExplain that in Doctrine and Covenants 136 , the Lord gave counsel to help the Saints on their journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Help your children find something in this revelation that could give them courage for this journey (see verses 4, 10–11, 18–30 ). How can this counsel help us with the trials we face today?"

  51-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world,"The Family: A Proclamation to the World",December 15–21,"","## Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church\n“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” is clearly about families. But it is equally about God’s plan of salvation. One way to study the proclamation is to write the phrases premortal life , mortal life , and postmortal life on a piece of paper and list what the proclamation teaches about each of these topics. What do you learn when you study the proclamation this way? How does this help you understand why marriage and family are essential to God’s plan? How do the truths in the proclamation influence your choices?\nThere are many people who, for a variety of reasons, might be fearful about marriage or raising children. If a friend said to you, “I don’t ever want to get married or have a family,” what would you say? Perhaps you could search the proclamation looking for something that would help your friend have hope in God’s plan.\nAnother question you might be asked—or that you might ask yourself—is one like this: “What if my family situation does not match what’s described in the family proclamation?” Here are two places you could look for prophetic counsel: the section “ A Mighty Change ” in Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “ Jesus Christ Is the Strength of Parents ” ( Liahona , May 2023, 55–59) and the last four paragraphs of Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “ Why Marriage, Why Family ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2015, 52).\nWhat do you feel inspired to do because of what you have studied?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ The Plan and the Proclamation ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 28–31; Topics and Questions, “ Family ,” Gospel Library.\nWe often think of the family proclamation as a guide for family life. But it also teaches important truths about our heavenly family and eternal identity. Why is it important for you to know that we are all part of this family? How does this truth influence the choices you make?\nSee also “ I Am a Child of God ,” Hymns , no. 301.\nThink of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the family proclamation as a pattern for “happiness in family life.” As you read these paragraphs, identify principles of “successful marriages and families.” You might think about examples of these principles that you have seen in your own family or other families. How do these principles help make Jesus Christ the foundation of family life?\nThen you might think about a family relationship you would like to strengthen. Make a plan, with the Savior’s help, to act on impressions you receive.\nSee also L. Whitney Clayton, “ The Finest Homes ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 107–9.\nParents should raise their children in love and righteousness.\nThe last paragraph of the family proclamation includes a call to action. As you consider how you will respond to that call, it might help to study the title of the proclamation. For instance, what is a proclamation? What does that word imply to you about this document’s message? What qualified the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles to issue a proclamation to the world about families? You might also make a list of what you consider to be the main messages of the proclamation. How can you promote these messages in your life, in your home, and in your community?\nSee also Bonnie L.

Hinckley\nClick to see more\n## “The family is central to the Creator’s plan.”\n“ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” is clearly about families. But it is equally about God’s plan of salvation. One way to study the proclamation is to write the phrases premortal life , mortal life , and postmortal life on a piece of paper and list what the proclamation teaches about each of these topics. What do you learn when you study the proclamation this way? How does this help you understand why marriage and family are essential to God’s plan? How do the truths in the proclamation influence your choices?\nThere are many people who, for a variety of reasons, might be fearful about marriage or raising children. If a friend said to you, “I don’t ever want to get married or have a family,” what would you say? Perhaps you could search the proclamation looking for something that would help your friend have hope in God’s plan.\nAnother question you might be asked—or that you might ask yourself—is one like this: “What if my family situation does not match what’s described in the family proclamation?” Here are two places you could look for prophetic counsel: the section “ A Mighty Change ” in Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “ Jesus Christ Is the Strength of Parents ” ( Liahona , May 2023, 55–59) and the last four paragraphs of Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “ Why Marriage, Why Family ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2015, 52).\nWhat do you feel inspired to do because of what you have studied?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ The Plan and the Proclamation ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 28–31; Topics and Questions, “ Family ,” Gospel Library.\n## “Each [person] is a beloved son or daughter of heavenly parents.”\nWe often think of the family proclamation as a guide for family life. But it also teaches important truths about our heavenly family and eternal identity. Why is it important for you to know that we are all part of this family? How does this truth influence the choices you make?\nSee also “ I Am a Child of God ,” Hymns , no. 301.\n## “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.”\nThink of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the family proclamation as a pattern for “happiness in family life.” As you read these paragraphs, identify principles of “successful marriages and families.” You might think about examples of these principles that you have seen in your own family or other families. How do these principles help make Jesus Christ the foundation of family life?\nThen you might think about a family relationship you would like to strengthen. Make a plan, with the Savior’s help, to act on impressions you receive.\nSee also L. Whitney Clayton, “ The Finest Homes ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 107–9.\nParents should raise their children in love and righteousness.\n## “We call upon responsible citizens … to maintain and strengthen the family.”\nThe last paragraph of the family proclamation includes a call to action. As you consider how you will respond to that call, it might help to study the title of the proclamation. For instance, what is a proclamation? What does that word imply to you about this document’s message? What qualified the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles to issue a proclamation to the world about families? You might also make a list of what you consider to be the main messages of the proclamation. How can you promote these messages in your life, in your home, and in your community?\nSee also Bonnie L.

Show the children a copy of “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ,” and explain that prophets and apostles wrote it to tell us all how important families are to Heavenly Father. Why are families so important to Him? (see also the video “ What Is the Purpose of Family? ” [ ChurchofJesusChrist.org ]).\nThe Family-Centered Gospel of Jesus Christ\nWhat Is the Purpose of Family?\nShare with your children something from the proclamation that you feel we all need to know. Invite the children to share their feelings about those truths. How would our lives be different if we did not know these things? You might sing together a song that relates to truths found in the proclamation, such as “ I Will Follow God’s Plan ” ( Children’s Songbook , 164–65).\nIn section IV of his message “ The Plan and the Proclamation ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 30), President Dallin H. Oaks described how the family proclamation was written. Perhaps you and your children could review his description together and talk about why you are grateful the Lord inspired His servants to teach us these truths about families.\nYou could also show your children pictures (or invite them to draw some) portraying truths found in the family proclamation . These could be pictures of a temple, a family praying or playing together, or a couple getting married. Then your children could find sentences in the family proclamation that relate to the pictures. What does the Lord teach us about these things in the proclamation?\nHeavenly Father wants families to be happy.\nBe sensitive. As you teach the truths taught in the family proclamation , please be aware that many children live in families that do not match the ideals described in the proclamation. Consider how you can encourage and inspire them.\nAs you sing together “ I Am a Child of God ” ( Children’s Songbook , 2–3), you could toss a ball to a child as you say, “I know a child of God named [child’s name].” Then that child could toss the object to someone else, saying the same words and inserting that person’s name. Help your children find the phrase “beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents” in the family proclamation , and bear your testimony of this truth.\nTo begin a conversation about strengthening your family, you and your children could talk about what we do to make other things strong—such as our teeth, our bodies, or a building. You could then compare that to building a strong family. Help your children find the Christlike principles that lead to happiness in family life, found in paragraph 7 of the family proclamation (see also this week’s activity page ).\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Families are important in Heavenly Father’s plan.\nHelp your children think of things that are so important that they would want to tell everyone about them.

Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenants by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] should enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” ( 2 Nephi 31:17 ).\nHere are some resources that can help you: 2 Nephi 31 ; special issue of the Friend magazine about baptism; Topics and Questions, “ Baptism ,” Gospel Library.\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child. Help them understand that faith is something that can grow stronger and stronger throughout life. What are some things your child can do to develop stronger faith in Christ before they are baptized?\nWhen your child makes a wrong choice, speak joyfully about the gift of repentance. And when you make a wrong choice, share the joy that comes when you repent. Testify that because Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, we can repent daily, be forgiven, and receive the power to change. When your child seeks forgiveness, forgive freely and joyfully.\nTell your child about your baptism. Show pictures and share memories. Talk about how you felt, how keeping your baptismal covenants has helped you come to know Jesus Christ better, and how your covenants continue to bless your life. Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like the following: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something they promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (See Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 .)\nTalk about how being confirmed and becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has blessed you. For example, how have you come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you have served others and as others have served you? Help your child think of ways to serve and strengthen others as a member of the Church. Also help them experience and recognize the joy that comes from service.\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell them about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have. Invite your child to share how they feel. Note the variety of ways the Spirit can speak to people, including ways He speaks to you personally. Help your child recognize and share with you moments when they may be experiencing the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nWatch together a few of the videos in the Gospel Library collection titled “ Hear Him! ” Talk together about the different ways the Lord’s servants hear His voice. Invite your child to draw a picture or make a video about how they hear the Savior’s voice.\nMake the sacrament a sacred and joyful event in your family. Share with your child how you focus on Jesus Christ during the sacrament. Help your child make a plan to show that the sacrament is sacred to them. For example, listening to the words of the sacrament prayers can remind us of our baptismal covenants.\nMany issues of the Friend magazine include articles, stories, and activities to help children prepare for baptism and confirmation. Let your child choose some to read and enjoy with you. (See also the collection “ Preparing for Baptism ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library.)\n## Priesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nThe priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “All Church members who keep their covenants—women, men, and children—are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families” ( General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 3.6 , Gospel Library). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see General Handbook , 2.2 ).\nWhen men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. All of Heavenly Father’s children—His sons and His daughters—will be blessed as they come to better understand the priesthood.\nWe receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. “Worthy male Church members receive priesthood authority through priesthood conferral and ordination to priesthood offices” ( General Handbook , 3.4 ). Those who hold priesthood offices can be authorized by someone who holds priesthood keys to perform priesthood ordinances.\nTo learn more about the priesthood, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Spiritual Treasures ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79; Russell M. Nelson, “ The Price of Priesthood Power ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 66–69; “ Priesthood Principles ,” chapter 3 in General Handbook .\nMake priesthood ordinances a consistent part of your family life. For example, help your child prepare spiritually for the sacrament each week. Encourage your child to seek priesthood blessings when they are sick or need comfort or direction. Make it a habit to point out ways the Lord is blessing your family through priesthood power.\nAs you read the scriptures together, watch for opportunities to discuss how God blesses people through His power. Share your own experiences of when God has blessed you through His priesthood. For examples of blessings we receive from God through the priesthood, see General Handbook , 3.2 , 3.5 .\nTeach your child that after baptism, they can receive priesthood power by keeping the baptismal covenant. Review together President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ Spiritual Treasures ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79). Tell your child how priesthood ordinances have brought God’s power into your life. For a list of some of the ways we are blessed by priesthood power, see General Handbook , 3.5 .\nDiscuss the question “What is a servant of the Lord like?” Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:36–42 , and look for answers. Whenever you notice your child (or someone else) applying one of the principles or attributes in these verses, point it out.\nWhen you or your child uses keys to unlock a door or start a car, take a moment to compare those keys to the keys that priesthood leaders hold. (For a definition of priesthood keys, see General Handbook , 3.4.1 ). What do priesthood keys “unlock” or “start” for us? See also Gary E. Stevenson, “ Where Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood? ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 29–32; “Where Are the Keys?” (video), Gospel Library.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nWhen you are set apart for a calling, invite your child to be present, if possible. Let your child see you fulfilling your calling. You might even look for appropriate ways they can help you. Describe how you feel the Lord’s power in your calling.\n## Being Baptized and Confirmed for Ancestors\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In the house of the Lord, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including people who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year your child turns 12, they are old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors (see also 1 Corinthians 15:29 ).\nGo to the house of the Lord as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the temple recommend questions together. You can find them on pages 36–37 of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (2022). Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together Malachi 4:6 . Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on FamilySearch.org . Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “ Temple ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “ Preparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org .)\n## Receiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel to us from Heavenly Father and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching them the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Topics and Questions, “ Patriarchal Blessings ,” Gospel Library; Julie B. Beck, “ You Have a Noble Birthright ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2006, 106–8.\nShare with your child your experience of receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how He continues to guide you through this blessing. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nReview together Elder Randall K. Bennett’s message “Your Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father ” and Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita’s message “ When to Receive Your Patriarchal Blessing ” ( Liahona , May 2023, 42–43, 88–90). Share with each other what you learn from these messages about why Heavenly Father wants us to receive a patriarchal blessing. To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see General Handbook , 18.17 .\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to ChurchofJesusChrist.org , click Tools at the top right corner of the screen, and select Patriarchal Blessing .\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and share them with your child.\n## Receiving the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” ( Doctrine and Covenants 95:8 ). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the house of the Lord. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there. Look for opportunities to go to the temple with your child to perform baptisms and confirmations for their ancestors.\nExplore together temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Read together articles like “ About the Temple Endowment ” and “ Prepare for the House of the Lord .” Let your child ask any questions they have about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “ Prepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “ Home-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation ”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how they are keeping the baptismal covenant described in Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 . Also help your child notice how the Lord is blessing them. Build your child’s confidence in their ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ. You could use General Handbook , 27.2 , to review the covenants we make in the temple. If you have received the endowment, tell your children about how the temple garment helps you remember your covenants with Jesus Christ (see “Sacred Temple Clothing” [video], Gospel Library).\nSacred Temple Clothing\n## Serving a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to become a missionary long before you go on a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“ Becoming a Missionary ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2005, 45–46). The experiences your child has becoming a missionary will bless them eternally, not just for the period of time they may serve as a missionary.\nTo learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Preaching the Gospel of Peace ,” Liahona , May 2022, 6–7; M. Russell Ballard, “ Missionary Service Blessed My Life Forever ,” Liahona , May 2022, 8–10; “ Missionary Preparation: Adjusting to Missionary Life ,” Gospel Library.\nModel how to share the gospel in natural ways. Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive from the Savior’s restored gospel and as a member of His Church. Invite others to join your family in Church- and family-related activities.\nLook for opportunities for your family to interact with missionaries. Invite them to teach your friends, or offer to let them teach people in your home. Ask the missionaries about the experiences they’re having and how missionary service is helping them draw closer to Jesus Christ. Also ask what they did (or wish they had done) to prepare to be missionaries.\nIf you served a mission, talk openly and often about your experiences. Or invite friends or family members who served missions to talk about theirs. You could also talk about ways you’ve shared the gospel with others throughout your life. Help your child think of ways they can share the gospel.\nGive your child opportunities to teach your family principles of the gospel. Your child could also practice sharing their beliefs with others. For example, you could discuss questions like “How would we introduce the Book of Mormon to someone who has never heard of it?” or “How would we describe the need for the Savior to someone who is not a Christian?”\nHelp your child become comfortable talking to people. What are some good ways to start a conversation? Encourage your child to learn how to listen to what others say, understand what is in their hearts, and share truths of the gospel that could bless their lives.\nLook for opportunities for your child to learn about other cultures and faiths. Help them recognize and respect the good and true principles in others’ beliefs.\n## Receiving the Sealing Ordinance\nIn the temple, a husband and wife can be married for eternity. This occurs in an ordinance called “sealing.” Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your daughter or son, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help them prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nRead together “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” (Gospel Library). What does this proclamation teach about happiness in family life and about successful marriages? With your child, choose one of the principles listed in the proclamation to study. You could look up scriptures related to that principle in the Guide to the Scriptures . You could also set goals to apply that principle more fully in your family. As you work on your goals, discuss together the effect that living that principle has on family life.\nWith your child, read President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “ In Praise of Those Who Save ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 77–80). When you get to the section titled “ A Society of Disposables ,” you might look for things in your home that are disposable and other things that are not. Talk about how you treat things differently when you want them to last a long time. What does this suggest about how we should treat marriage and family relationships? What else do we learn from President Uchtdorf’s message about how the Savior can help us build strong marriages and families?\nBe open with your child about the things you and your spouse are learning about having a Christ-centered eternal marriage and the ways you’re trying to improve. If you and your spouse have been sealed in the temple, show your child by example how you strive to keep your covenants with the Lord. Tell your child how you strive to make Heavenly Father and the Savior the center of your relationship and how They are helping you (see also Ulisses Soares, “ In Partnership with the Lord ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 42–45).\nWhen family decisions need to be made, hold family councils and discussions. Make sure that all family members’ opinions are heard and valued. Use these discussions as an opportunity to model healthy communication and kindness in family relationships, even when not everyone sees things the same way. (See M. Russell Ballard, “ Family Councils ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 63–65.)\nWhen there is disagreement or conflict in the family, demonstrate patience and compassion. Help your child see how handling conflict in Christlike ways can help them prepare for a happy marriage. Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–42 , and talk about how the principles in these verses can be applied to marriage."

Invite them to draw a picture of themselves on their baptism day.\nPreparing for baptism means much more than preparing for an event. It means preparing to make a covenant and then keeping that covenant for a lifetime. Ponder how you can help the children understand the covenant they will make with Heavenly Father when they are baptized, which includes the promises He makes to them and the promises they make to Him.\nExplain that a covenant is a promise between a person and Heavenly Father.

Ask this person to talk about what it means to him or her to become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Help the children think of ways they can keep their baptismal covenant as members of the Church (such as serving others, inviting others to learn more about Jesus, saying prayers in meetings, and so on). Share how doing these things has helped you feel the joy of being a member of Christ’s Church.\nShow a picture of the people at the Waters of Mormon (see Gospel Art Book , no. 76 ), and ask the children to describe what they see in the picture. Tell the story of Alma and his people being baptized there (see Mosiah 18:1–17 ; “ Chapter 15: Alma Teaches and Baptizes ,” in Book of Mormon Stories , 43–44, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). Review Mosiah 18:8–9 and invite the children to do actions to help them remember the things the people were willing to do as members of Christ’s Church. For example, how can we help others “take a step toward making covenants with God”? (Russell M. Nelson, “ Hope of Israel ” [worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018], Gospel Library). Share an experience of when you have witnessed members of the Church serving in these ways.\nAlma at the Waters of Mormon\nWhen we are baptized and confirmed, Heavenly Father promises that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]” ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:77 ).

Help them understand that there are many ways the Holy Ghost can speak to us.\nHelp the children think of different ways we could talk to a friend who lives far away, such as writing a letter, sending an email, or talking on the phone. Teach them that Heavenly Father can speak to us in different ways through the Holy Ghost. Use President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “ How Does Heavenly Father Speak to Us? ” to help the children understand the different ways the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds and hearts ( Friend , Mar. 2020, 2–3, or Liahona , Mar. 2020, F2–F3).\nShare an experience when the Holy Ghost communicated with you, either through thoughts in your mind or through a feeling in your heart (see Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23 ; 8:2–3 ; see also Henry B. Eyring, “ Open Your Heart to the Holy Ghost ,” Friend , Aug. 2019, 2–3, or Liahona , Aug. 2019, F2–F3). Testify to the children that the Holy Ghost can help them in similar ways.\nHelp the children recognize times when they are feeling the Spirit—for example, when singing a song about the Savior or when doing something kind for others. Help them recognize the spiritual feelings that the Holy Ghost brings, especially His promptings to act. Why do you think the Holy Ghost gives us these feelings? Help the children think of things that we need to do to hear the Holy Ghost speak to us.

  55-appendix-c-for-primary-instructions-for-singing-time,For Primary—Instructions for Singing Time and the Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation,"","","## Guidelines for the Sacrament Meeting Presentation\nWith the direction of the bishop, the children’s sacrament meeting presentation is normally held during the fourth quarter of the year. As the Primary presidency and music leader, work with the counselor in the bishopric who oversees Primary to plan the presentation.\nThe presentation should allow the children to present what they and their families have learned from the Doctrine and Covenants at home and in Primary, including the Primary songs they have sung during the year. As you plan the presentation, think of ways it can help the congregation focus on the Savior and His teachings.\nUnits with small numbers of children may consider ways in which family members can participate with their children. A member of the bishopric may conclude the meeting with brief remarks.\nAs you prepare the presentation, remember the following guidelines:\nPractices should not take unnecessary time away from Primary classes or families.\nVisuals, costumes, and media presentations are not appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSee General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 12.2.1.2 , Gospel Library.\n5 minutes (Primary presidency): Opening prayer, scripture or article of faith, and one talk\n20 minutes (music leader): Singing time\nThe Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. A list of songs that reinforce these principles is included in this guide.\nAs you teach songs to the children, invite them to share what they have already learned about the stories and doctrinal principles the songs teach. Invite the children to share their thoughts and feelings about the truths found in the songs.\nThe Children’s Songbook is the basic resource for music in Primary.

The following ideas can inspire you as you plan ways to teach the gospel principles found in hymns and Primary songs.\nRead related scriptures. For many of the songs in the Children’s Songbook and the hymnbook, references to related scriptures are listed. Help the children read some of these passages, and talk about how the scriptures are related to the song. You could also list a few scripture references on the board and invite the children to match each reference to a song or a verse from a song.\nFill in the blank. Write a verse of the song on the board with several key words missing. Then ask the children to sing the song, listening for the words that fill in the blanks. As they fill in each blank, discuss what gospel principles you learn from the missing words.\nTestify. Bear brief testimony to the children of gospel truths found in the Primary song. Help the children understand that singing is one way they can bear testimony and feel the Spirit.\nStand as a witness. Invite children to take turns standing and sharing what they learn from the song they are singing or how they feel about the truths taught in the song. Ask them how they feel as they sing the song, and help them identify the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nUse pictures. Ask the children to help you find or create pictures that go with important words or phrases in the song. Invite them to share how the pictures relate to the song and what the song teaches. For example, if you are teaching the song “ When He Comes Again ” ( Children’s Songbook , 82–83), you could place pictures throughout the room that depict important words from the song (such as angels , snow , and star ). Ask the children to gather the pictures and hold them up in the correct order as you sing the song together.\nShare an object lesson. You could use an object to inspire discussion about a song. For example, when singing the song “ ‘Give,’ Said the Little Stream ” ( Children’s Songbook , 236), you could show the children a picture of things like a stream, grass, rain, and flowers. This could lead to a discussion about how even small acts of service can bless others in important ways.\nInvite sharing of personal experiences. Help the children connect the principles taught in the song with experiences they have had with these principles. For example, before singing “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95), you could ask the children to raise their hands if they have seen a temple. Invite them, as they sing, to think about how they feel when they see a temple.\nAsk questions. There are many questions you can ask as you sing songs. For example, you can ask the children what they learn from each verse in the song. You can also ask them to think of questions that the song answers. This can lead to a discussion about the truths taught in the song.\nUse simple hand actions. Invite the children to think of simple hand actions to help them remember the words and messages of a song. For example, when you sing “ Search, Ponder, and Pray ” ( Children’s Songbook , 109), you could invite the children to point to their eyes as they sing about searching the scriptures, point to their heads as they sing about pondering, and fold their arms as they sing about praying.\n## Instructions for Singing Time\n5 minutes (Primary presidency): Opening prayer, scripture or article of faith, and one talk\n20 minutes (music leader): Singing time\nThe Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. A list of songs that reinforce these principles is included in this guide.\nAs you teach songs to the children, invite them to share what they have already learned about the stories and doctrinal principles the songs teach. Invite the children to share their thoughts and feelings about the truths found in the songs.\nThe Children’s Songbook is the basic resource for music in Primary. Hymns from the hymnbook and songs from the Friend are also appropriate.
