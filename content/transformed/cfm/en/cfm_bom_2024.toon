For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond a classroom into an individual’s heart and home. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. True conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI."
  "002-using","UsingCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church","","Moroni 6:4,Alma 36","## Who Is This Resource For?\nThis resource is for anyone who wants to learn from the Book of Mormon—individually, as a family, and in Church classes. If you haven’t studied the scriptures regularly in the past, this resource can help you get started. If you already have a good habit of scripture study, this resource can help you have more meaningful experiences.\n## Individuals and Families at Home\nThe ideal place to learn the gospel is the home. Your teachers at church can support you, and you can get encouragement from other ward members. But to survive spiritually, you and your family need daily nourishment from “the good word of God” ( Moroni 6:4 ; see also Russell M. Nelson, “ Opening Remarks ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 6–8).\nUse this resource in any way that is helpful to you. The outlines highlight some eternal truths found in the Book of Mormon and suggest ideas and activities to help you study the scriptures individually, with your family, or with friends. As you study, follow the Spirit’s guidance to find eternal truths that are meaningful to you. Look for God’s messages for you, and follow the promptings you receive.\n## Teachers and Learners at Church\nIf you teach a Primary class, a youth or adult Sunday School class, an Aaronic Priesthood quorum, or a Young Woman class, you are encouraged to use the outlines in this resource as you prepare to teach. Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church is the curriculum for your Sunday class. The learning ideas in this resource are designed for learning at home and at church. As you prepare to teach, start by having your own experiences in the scriptures. Your most important preparation will occur as you search the scriptures and seek the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Look for eternal truths that help you become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Come, Follow Me can help you identify some of these truths and understand the context of the scriptures.\nKeep in mind that learning the gospel, at its best, is home centered and Church supported. In other words, your main responsibility is to support the people you teach in their efforts to learn and live the gospel at home. Give them opportunities to share their experiences, thoughts, and questions about the scripture passages. Invite them to share the eternal truths they have found. This is more important than covering a certain amount of material.\nYour preparation to teach Primary begins as you study the Book of Mormon personally and with your family. As you do, be open to spiritual impressions and insights from the Holy Ghost about the children in your Primary class. Be prayerful, and the Spirit can inspire you with ideas to help them learn the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nAs you prepare to teach, you might gain additional inspiration by exploring the teaching ideas in this resource. Each outline in Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church has a section titled “Ideas for Teaching Children.” Think of these ideas as suggestions to spark your inspiration. You know the children in your Primary class—and you will get to know them even better as you interact with them in class. God knows them too, and He will inspire you with the best ways to teach and bless them.\nIt’s possible that children in your class will have already done some of the activities in Come, Follow Me with their families. That’s OK. Repetition is good. Consider inviting the children to share with each other what they learned at home—though you should also plan ways for children to participate even if they aren’t learning at home. Children learn gospel truths more effectively when these truths are taught repeatedly through a variety of activities. If you find that a learning activity is effective for the children, consider repeating it, especially if you are teaching younger children. You might also review an activity from a previous lesson.\nIn months that have five Sundays, Primary teachers are encouraged to replace the scheduled Come, Follow Me outline on the fifth Sunday with one or more of the learning activities in “ Appendix B: For Primary—Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path .”\nOne main reason we gather in Sunday School classes is to support and encourage one another as we strive to follow Jesus Christ. A simple way to do this is to ask a question like “What has the Holy Ghost taught you this week as you studied the Book of Mormon with Come, Follow Me ?” Answers to this question could lead to meaningful discussions that build faith in Jesus Christ and His gospel.\nThen you could invite discussion based on the study suggestions in Come, Follow Me . For instance, a study idea might suggest searching Alma 36 and making a list of words that teach about the Savior’s role in repentance. You might ask class members to share and talk about the words they found. Or you could spend some time making the list together as a class.\nWhen Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes meet on Sundays, their purpose is somewhat different from a Sunday School class. In addition to helping each other learn the gospel of Jesus Christ, these groups also meet to counsel together about accomplishing the work of salvation and exaltation (see General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 1.2 ). They do this under the direction of class and quorum presidencies.\nFor this reason, each quorum or class meeting should begin with a member of the quorum or class presidency leading a discussion about efforts to, for example, live the gospel, minister to people in need, share the gospel, or participate in temple and family history work.\nAfter this time for counseling together, an instructor leads the class or quorum in learning the gospel together. Adult leaders or members of the class or quorum can be assigned to teach. The class or quorum presidency, consulting with adult leaders, makes these assignments.\nPeople assigned to teach should prepare by using the learning suggestions in the weekly outline of Come, Follow Me . In each outline, this icon indicates an activity that is especially relevant to youth. However, any of the suggestions in the outline could be used as a learning activity for youth.\nFor a sample agenda for quorum and class meetings, see appendix D .\n## Primary\nYour preparation to teach Primary begins as you study the Book of Mormon personally and with your family.

You could do the same for your children—give them pictures of the events Nephi saw in 1 Nephi 11:20, 24, 27, 31, and 33 (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 30 , 35 , 39 , 42 , 57 ). As you read these verses, help your children find the picture that matches it. What do we learn about Jesus Christ from these verses and pictures?\nSinging a song like “ He Sent His Son ” ( Children’s Songbook , 34–35) could help your children feel God’s love. After you sing, ask your children what they learn from the song. What else do we learn about God’s love from 1 Nephi 11:22–23 ?\nUse art to help children learn. When you teach your children a scripture story, help them visualize it. You could use pictures, videos, puppets, costumes, and so on.\n1 Nephi 13:26–29, 35–36, 40\nTo help your children value the “plain and precious” truths in the Book of Mormon, you could draw a picture and invite your children to change or remove parts of the picture to make it look different. You could use this to teach that things in the Bible were changed and taken out over time. Read together 1 Nephi 13:40 and talk about how the Book of Mormon (“these last records”) helps us understand the “plain and precious things” that were lost from the Bible (the “first” records). What “plain and precious” truths have you learned from the Book of Mormon?\nThe video “The Book of Mormon—a Book from God” (Gospel Library) could help your children see why it’s important to have both the Bible and the Book of Mormon.

Your children could share what the opposite of the wrong choice is and act it out.\nTo learn about the difference between “liberty” and “captivity” ( 2 Nephi 2:27 ), your children could draw pictures of an animal in a cage and an animal in its natural environment. Which animal is free? Invite the children to point at the correct picture when you read the word “free” in 2 Nephi 2:27 . Testify that Jesus Christ makes us free.\nSing together a song like “ Choose the Right ” ( Hymns , no. 239). What do we learn from the song about making choices?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

As you read these chapters, think about questions like the following:\nWhat do I learn about the Savior’s redeeming love for me?

As you read 2 Nephi 9:1–26 , consider listing or marking in one color what would happen to us without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Then, in another list or color, you could identify what we can receive through the Savior’s Atonement. Based on what you read, how would you explain why we need the Atonement of Jesus Christ? What did you find that inspires you to praise the “wisdom of God, his mercy and grace”? ( 2 Nephi 9:8 ).\nIn addition to teaching what Jesus Christ saved us from, Jacob also gave insights about how He did it. Consider recording what you find in 2 Nephi 9:11–15, 20–24 .\nJacob was so awed by God’s plan of redemption that he exclaimed, “O how great the plan of our God.” Look for his exclamations in 2 Nephi 9 (most of them are found in verses 8–20 ). What do you learn from these verses about God’s plan? What experiences have helped you feel some of what Jacob felt?

Consider using 2 Nephi 9:21–22 to talk with your children about why you are grateful for Jesus Christ.\nOne way to help your children understand why we need the Savior is to teach them about the Fall. You could show a picture of Adam and Eve, such as Leaving the Garden of Eden (Gospel Library), and a picture of Jesus Christ on the cross. Consider asking them to describe what is happening in each picture. How are we like Adam and Eve? Perhaps 2 Nephi 9:6–10 can help them see what Jesus Christ does for us. Consider inviting your children to share their feelings about Jesus Christ. A song like “ I Feel My Savior’s Love ” ( Children’s Songbook , 74–75) could help.\nTeach truth with stories and examples. Be sure the stories and examples you use teach truth.

Invite your children to stand up when the choice brings happiness and sit down when the choice brings sadness. When have we felt happy because we made a choice to follow Jesus Christ?\nYour children are likely to interact with people (if they haven’t already) who think that the Lord’s commandments are foolish or out of date. Maybe you and your children could talk about how to explain why we’re happy to keep the commandments. Why is it important to trust God’s counsel even if we do not completely understand it? You could encourage them to look in 2 Nephi 9:20, 28–29, 42–43 for help with thinking about and discussing these questions.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Jesus Christ is my Savior.\n2 Nephi 9:6–10, 19–24\nHow will you help your children understand and feel that they need the Savior Jesus Christ?

But he also shared ideas to help us find meaning in Isaiah’s writings:\n“ Liken his words unto” yourself ( 2 Nephi 11:2 ). Many of Isaiah’s teachings have multiple possible meanings and applications. For example, when you read about dwelling places in 2 Nephi 14:5–6 , consider how these verses apply to your home. Ask yourself, “What does Heavenly Father want me to learn?”\nLook for symbols of Jesus Christ (see 2 Nephi 11:4 ). Many of Isaiah’s teachings about the Savior are conveyed through symbols. For example, how is the Savior represented in 2 Nephi 19:2 ? What does this symbol teach you about Him?\nSeek to be “filled with the spirit of prophecy ” ( 2 Nephi 25:4 ). As you study, pray for spiritual guidance. You may not understand everything at first, but the Spirit can help you learn what you need to know.\nYou might also find it helpful to refer to the study helps in the scriptures, including the footnotes, chapter headings, and Guide to the Scriptures . The Book of Mormon and Old Testament institute manuals have additional information that can help you learn about the historical context of Isaiah’s teachings.\n2 Nephi 11–19\nBecause Isaiah used symbolic language, it can be easy to overlook his powerful witness of Jesus Christ. Look for the Savior in 2 Nephi 13:13 ; 14:4–6 ; 15:1–7 ; 16:1–7 ; 17:14 ; 18:14–15 ; 22:2 . What do these verses teach you about Him?\nThe prophecy in 2 Nephi 19:6 lists several of Jesus Christ’s titles. How has He fulfilled these roles in your life?\nSee also Ulisses Soares, “ Jesus Christ: The Caregiver of Our Soul ,” Liahona , May 2021, 82–84.\n2 Nephi 12–13 ; 15\nNephi had foreseen that pride would cause the downfall of his people (see 1 Nephi 12:19 ). So it’s not surprising that Nephi would share with his people Isaiah’s repeated warnings against pride. In chapters 12 and 13 , look for words that Isaiah used to describe pridefulness, such as lofty and haughty . In 2 Nephi 15:1–24 , look for symbolic language describing the results of pride. Then you might try to summarize what you have read in your own words. Think about how you will choose to be humble.\nSee also “ Chapter 18: Beware of Pride, ” Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson (2014), 229–40.\n2 Nephi 12:2–3\nIsaiah called the temple “the mountain of the Lord’s house” ( 2 Nephi 12:2 ). Why is a mountain a good symbol for the temple?\nHow would you explain to someone why we need temples? You could find some possible answers in 2 Nephi 12:2–3 and President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ The Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2021, 93–96). Based on what you read, what does the Lord want you to learn and experience in His holy house? What experiences have you had there?\nYou can find the temple recommend interview questions on pages 36–37 of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices . Consider reading each one and asking yourself, what does this question teach me about the Lord’s ways? How does it help me “walk in his ways”?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “ Temples ,” Gospel Library; “ High on the Mountain Top ,” Hymns , no 5.\n2 Nephi 12–19\nDespite the wickedness he observed, Isaiah saw hope for the future. Consider studying each of the following passages. Write one or more truths each passage teaches about our day: 2 Nephi 12:1–5 ; 14:2–6 ; 15:20–26 ; 19:2–8 . Why do you feel these passages are important for us to understand?\nLook for patterns. In the scriptures we can find patterns that show us how the Lord works. In 2 Nephi 11–19 , you might look for patterns that show how the Lord warns of sin and forgives people who repent.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## How can I better understand the teachings of Isaiah?\nNephi acknowledged that “the words of Isaiah are not plain” ( 2 Nephi 25:4 ). But he also shared ideas to help us find meaning in Isaiah’s writings:\n“ Liken his words unto” yourself ( 2 Nephi 11:2 ). Many of Isaiah’s teachings have multiple possible meanings and applications. For example, when you read about dwelling places in 2 Nephi 14:5–6 , consider how these verses apply to your home. Ask yourself, “What does Heavenly Father want me to learn?”\nLook for symbols of Jesus Christ (see 2 Nephi 11:4 ). Many of Isaiah’s teachings about the Savior are conveyed through symbols. For example, how is the Savior represented in 2 Nephi 19:2 ? What does this symbol teach you about Him?\nSeek to be “filled with the spirit of prophecy ” ( 2 Nephi 25:4 ). As you study, pray for spiritual guidance. You may not understand everything at first, but the Spirit can help you learn what you need to know.\nYou might also find it helpful to refer to the study helps in the scriptures, including the footnotes, chapter headings, and Guide to the Scriptures . The Book of Mormon and Old Testament institute manuals have additional information that can help you learn about the historical context of Isaiah’s teachings.\n## Isaiah testified of Jesus Christ.\n2 Nephi 11–19\nBecause Isaiah used symbolic language, it can be easy to overlook his powerful witness of Jesus Christ. Look for the Savior in 2 Nephi 13:13 ; 14:4–6 ; 15:1–7 ; 16:1–7 ; 17:14 ; 18:14–15 ; 22:2 . What do these verses teach you about Him?\nThe prophecy in 2 Nephi 19:6 lists several of Jesus Christ’s titles. How has He fulfilled these roles in your life?\nSee also Ulisses Soares, “ Jesus Christ: The Caregiver of Our Soul ,” Liahona , May 2021, 82–84.\n## The proud and worldly will be humbled.\n2 Nephi 12–13 ; 15\nNephi had foreseen that pride would cause the downfall of his people (see 1 Nephi 12:19 ). So it’s not surprising that Nephi would share with his people Isaiah’s repeated warnings against pride. In chapters 12 and 13 , look for words that Isaiah used to describe pridefulness, such as lofty and haughty . In 2 Nephi 15:1–24 , look for symbolic language describing the results of pride. Then you might try to summarize what you have read in your own words. Think about how you will choose to be humble.\nSee also “ Chapter 18: Beware of Pride, ” Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson (2014), 229–40.\n## The temple is the house of the Lord.\n2 Nephi 12:2–3\nIsaiah called the temple “the mountain of the Lord’s house” ( 2 Nephi 12:2 ). Why is a mountain a good symbol for the temple?\nHow would you explain to someone why we need temples? You could find some possible answers in 2 Nephi 12:2–3 and President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ The Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2021, 93–96). Based on what you read, what does the Lord want you to learn and experience in His holy house? What experiences have you had there?\nYou can find the temple recommend interview questions on pages 36–37 of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices . Consider reading each one and asking yourself, what does this question teach me about the Lord’s ways? How does it help me “walk in his ways”?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “ Temples ,” Gospel Library; “ High on the Mountain Top ,” Hymns , no 5.\n## Jesus Christ will redeem His people.\n2 Nephi 12–19\nDespite the wickedness he observed, Isaiah saw hope for the future. Consider studying each of the following passages. Write one or more truths each passage teaches about our day: 2 Nephi 12:1–5 ; 14:2–6 ; 15:20–26 ; 19:2–8 .

Help them find phrases in these verses that describe why we have temples.\nTo illustrate the phrase “we will walk in his paths” from 2 Nephi 12:3 , you could make a path on the floor, leading to a picture of a temple. As your children walk on the path, they could name things they can do to walk in the Lord’s paths.\nPerhaps your children could draw a picture of themselves going to the temple. They could also sing or listen to a song about the temple, such as “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95). Help them find phrases in the song that teach what the temple is and what we do there.\n2 Nephi 11:4–7 ; 17:14 ; 19:6\nThere are several names for Jesus Christ in 2 Nephi 11:4–7 ; 17:14 ; 19:6 . Help your children find them and talk about what they mean. For example, “Christ” means “the anointed” and “Immanuel” means “God with us.” What do these names teach us about Jesus?\nShow portions of the video “The Christ Child” (Gospel Library) that show different people seeing Jesus for the first time. Pause the video during these depictions, and ask your children about what these people might have felt. What would we feel if we were there? How will we feel when we see Him again?\nThe Christ Child\n2 Nephi 15:20\nShow your children something bitter or sour, such as a lemon slice, inside a candy wrapper. Read together 2 Nephi 15:20 . How does Satan try to make things that are evil look good? You could also show the first 90 seconds of the video “You Will Be Freed” (Gospel Library). Why does the fisherman disguise his hook? Why does Satan disguise sin? How does Jesus Christ help us avoid being deceived by Satan?\nYou Will Be Freed\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The temple is the house of the Lord.\n2 Nephi 12:2–3\nIsaiah described the temple as “the mountain of the Lord’s house.” Your children might enjoy pretending to climb a mountain as you read 2 Nephi 12:2–3 .

But to Nephi’s people—and to us today—the bigger threat is what Babylon represents: worldliness and sin.

What did Nephi want people to know about the Savior? (see verses 12–13, 16 ). How did Nephi try to persuade people to believe in Him? (see verses 19–29 ). Note passages in this chapter that persuade you to believe in and follow Jesus Christ.\nSome of us may not feel as bold as Nephi was about talking of Christ. But maybe you can find something in Nephi’s teachings in 2 Nephi 25:23–26 that inspires you to talk about Him with others more openly. For example, Nephi’s declaration “We rejoice in Christ” might prompt you to think about how the Savior brings you joy—and how you can share that joy with others.\nIn his message “ We Talk of Christ ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 88–91), Elder Neil L.

( 2 Nephi 28:28 ). Do I ever feel this way? If so, how can I change?\nWhat does it mean to receive God’s word? How can I show Him that I want to receive more of His word?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\n2 Nephi 26:23–28, 33\nTo teach your children about the Savior’s invitations in these verses, you might talk with them about times they invited people to a special event, like a birthday party. Then you could read 2 Nephi 26:23–28 together and find out what Jesus is inviting us to do. Your children might like to create a card inviting someone to come unto Jesus Christ. Encourage them to use a phrase from these verses in their invitation.\nThe painting at the end of this outline shows people from many backgrounds. Maybe your children could look at this picture as you read 2 Nephi 26:33 . You could repeat the phrase “Jesus invites all to come unto Him” as your children point to each person in the picture—and then to themselves. How do we come unto Jesus?\nA song about loving all people, such as “ I’ll Walk with You ” ( Children’s Songbook , 140–41), could help you teach the message of 2 Nephi 26:33 .\n2 Nephi 28:2 ; 29:7–11 ; 30:3–6\nTo help your children feel that the Book of Mormon is “of great worth” ( 2 Nephi 28:2 ), you could wrap a copy as a gift and let them guess what’s inside. They could look for clues in 2 Nephi 30:3–6 . Tell your children why the Book of Mormon is of great worth to you, and let them share their feelings too.\nConsider asking your children to imagine that a friend says, “I don’t need to read the Book of Mormon. I’ve already read the Bible.” What could we say to our friend? Read together 2 Nephi 29:7–11 to learn why God wants us to have both books.\n2 Nephi 28:30–31\nPerhaps you can think of an object lesson that will help your children understand what it means to learn “line upon line.” For example, they could put together a puzzle or build something with blocks, one piece at a time. Or you could teach them a skill step by step, such as tying a bow or drawing a picture. You could then read 2 Nephi 28:30 and discuss how Heavenly Father teaches us one truth at a time.\nAnother idea could be to choose a phrase from 2 Nephi 28:30 and take turns writing it, one word at a time. How is this like the way God gives us truth? Why does God reveal truth to us “line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little” instead of all at once? How can we show God that we want to receive more truth from Him?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Jesus Christ wants everyone to come unto Him.\n2 Nephi 26:23–28, 33\nTo teach your children about the Savior’s invitations in these verses, you might talk with them about times they invited people to a special event, like a birthday party.

Share with them the blessings you’ve received as you’ve feasted on the scriptures.\n2 Nephi 32:8–9\nAfter reading 2 Nephi 32:8–9 , talk with your children about why Satan doesn’t want us to pray. Why does God want us to “pray always”? Your children could make a list or draw pictures of situations in which they could pray. Then you could sing a song that teaches about prayer, such as “ Did You Think to Pray? ” ( Hymns , no. 140). You could replace some of the words in the song with the words from their lists.

What insights does the Book of Mormon offer about resurrection? Perhaps this Easter season you could list truths about resurrection that you find in 2 Nephi 9:6–15, 22 ; Alma 11:42–45 ; 40:21–25 ; 3 Nephi 26:4–5 .\nYou could also record how these truths about resurrection influence your actions and the way you live. For example, consider how you would complete these sentences: If I did not know these things … and Because I know these things …\nA hymn like “ I Know That My Redeemer Lives ” ( Hymns , no. 136) could help you think about why the Savior’s Resurrection is important to you. As you sing, listen to, or read the hymn, you might ask yourself, “How is my life different because Jesus Christ was resurrected?”\nThe Gospel Library has a collection of Easter videos that could be a meaningful part of your study. Perhaps you could watch one or more of these videos and ponder what they add to your understanding or appreciation of the Savior’s Resurrection.\nSee also Luke 24:36–43 ; Acts 24:15 ; 1 Corinthians 15:12–23 ; Reyna I.

The Book of Mormon expands our understanding of Christ’s sacrifice and suffering in important ways. You can find some of these teachings in Mosiah 3:7 ; 15:5–9 ; Alma 7:11–13 . After you read these passages, consider recording what you discover in a chart like this one:\nWhat did the Savior suffer?\nWhy did He suffer?\nWhat does this mean to me?\nHere’s another way to study these passages: Look for hymns that you feel match the messages they teach.

Or let your children tell you the story, using the pictures in these chapters.\nThe Risen Savior’s visit to the Americas is a powerful witness of His Resurrection. Consider telling your children about it, using 3 Nephi 11 ; 17 ; the song “ Easter Hosanna ”; or the last verse of “ Book of Mormon Stories ” ( Children’s Songbook , 68–69, 118–19). Encourage your children to imagine what it would have been like to feel Jesus’s wounds (see 3 Nephi 11:14–15 ) or to be one of the children He blessed (see 3 Nephi 17:21 ). Share with each other your feelings about Jesus Christ and His Resurrection.\nTo help your children discover what the Book of Mormon teaches about resurrection, you could invite them to pretend that you don’t know anything about it and ask them to explain it to you. Help them look in 2 Nephi 9:10–15 ; Alma 11:41–45 ; and Alma 40:21–23 for answers to questions like these: What does it mean to be resurrected? Who will be resurrected? Also invite them to bear testimony of the Savior’s Resurrection as part of their answer.\nMosiah 3:7 and Alma 7:11 describe some of what the Savior went through as part of His Atonement. You might read one of these verses to your children and ask them to listen for words that tell them what Jesus suffered for us. Then you could read Alma 7:12 to find out why He suffered it. Testify that Jesus Christ felt all of our pains and sicknesses so that He could comfort us.\nDo your children have a favorite hymn or song about Jesus Christ and His Atonement? You could sing it together—or learn a new one. Talk about words or phrases in the lyrics that teach you about the comfort and peace the Savior offers us.\nGethsemane , by Michael T. Malm\nThe Book of Mormon gives many examples of people who were changed because of the Savior’s Atonement. Perhaps your children could choose one to learn about, such as Enos (see Enos 1:2–8 ), Alma the Younger (see Mosiah 27:8–24 ), or the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (see Alma 24:7–19 ). How did this person or group change because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ? How can we follow their examples?\nYou and your children could also compare something clean and something dirty and talk about how dirty things are made clean. Read together Alma 13:11–13 . What did Jesus do so that we can be made clean from our sins? How does this make us feel about sin? How does it make us feel about the Savior?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\nLive worthy of the Spirit’s guidance. The Spirit is the real teacher. As you seek His guidance and live worthily, He will give you thoughts and impressions about how to meet the needs of the people you teach.\n## Because Jesus Christ was resurrected, I will be resurrected too.\nYou can use “ Chapter 53: Jesus Is Crucified ” and “ Chapter 54: Jesus Is Risen ” (in New Testament Stories , 136–38, 139–44) to tell your children about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Or let your children tell you the story, using the pictures in these chapters.\nThe Risen Savior’s visit to the Americas is a powerful witness of His Resurrection.

You might read one of these verses to your children and ask them to listen for words that tell them what Jesus suffered for us. Then you could read Alma 7:12 to find out why He suffered it. Testify that Jesus Christ felt all of our pains and sicknesses so that He could comfort us.\nDo your children have a favorite hymn or song about Jesus Christ and His Atonement? You could sing it together—or learn a new one. Talk about words or phrases in the lyrics that teach you about the comfort and peace the Savior offers us.\nGethsemane , by Michael T. Malm\n## Jesus Christ can cleanse me and help me change.\nThe Book of Mormon gives many examples of people who were changed because of the Savior’s Atonement. Perhaps your children could choose one to learn about, such as Enos (see Enos 1:2–8 ), Alma the Younger (see Mosiah 27:8–24 ), or the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (see Alma 24:7–19 ). How did this person or group change because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ? How can we follow their examples?\nYou and your children could also compare something clean and something dirty and talk about how dirty things are made clean. Read together Alma 13:11–13 . What did Jesus do so that we can be made clean from our sins? How does this make us feel about sin? How does it make us feel about the Savior?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\nLive worthy of the Spirit’s guidance. The Spirit is the real teacher.

It describes trees and fruit and laborers, but it’s really about God’s interactions with His people throughout history. So as you read the basic story, think about what some of the things in the story might symbolize.\nFor example, if the vineyard represents the world, and the tame olive tree represents Israel (or those who have made covenants with God; see Jacob 5:3 ), what might the wild olive trees represent? What could the good and bad fruit represent? What other symbols do you see?\nEven though Jacob 5 teaches about nations and centuries of world history, it’s also about you and your life. What messages do you find for yourself in Jacob 5 ?\nPerhaps most important, Jacob 5 is about Jesus Christ. Look for Him as you read. What do you learn about Him, for example, in verses 40–41, 46–47 ?\nFor additional insights about Jacob 5 , see the diagram at the end of this outline.\nJacob 5:61–75\nThe “other servants” ( Jacob 5:70 ) who were called into the Lord’s vineyard include people like you. What truths do you find in Jacob 5 , especially verses 61–62 and 70–75 , about working in the Lord’s vineyard? What have you learned about Him by helping with His work?\nAs you read about the “last time” that the Lord labors in His vineyard, what inspires you to serve the Lord “with your might”? ( Jacob 5:71 ). Maybe you could think of a personal experience in which you felt joy while serving the Lord of the vineyard—for example, through sharing the gospel, serving in the temple, or strengthening others. You might also explore the examples Elder Gary E. Stevenson shared in his message “ Simply Beautiful—Beautifully Simple ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2021, 47–50).\nPresident Russell M.

What can you learn from Enos 1:1–4 about Jacob’s influence on his son Enos? For example, what does the phrase “the nurture and admonition of the Lord” mean to you? How can you invite His influence in your home?\nAs you think about your own family, consider these questions and resources:\nHow can you influence your family in positive ways? (see 1 Nephi 2:16–18 ; 3:15–21 ; 5:1–6 ; 7:20–21 ; Alma 36:17–20 ; “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ”).

What would they like to talk about? What might He want to say to them?\nAs you read aloud Enos 1:1–5 , younger children could pretend to be Enos by acting out hunting, kneeling to pray, and so on. Older children could listen for a word or phrase that describes Enos’s prayers. What do these words tell us about Enos’s prayers? Share an experience when your soul “hungered” and you “cried unto” the Lord ( Enos 1:4 ).\nAs children of God, we can pray to our Heavenly Father.\nEnos 1:2–16\nHow can you help your children understand that Heavenly Father will hear and answer their prayers?

How do you “watch [yourself]”?\n## The Spirit of the Lord can cause a mighty change in my heart.\nMosiah 5:1–5\nIt’s common for people to say, “I can’t change. That’s just the way I am.” In contrast, the experience of King Benjamin’s people shows us how the Spirit of the Lord can truly change our hearts. As you read Mosiah 5:1–5 , think about how the “mighty change” leading to true conversion has happened—or can happen—in your life. Think about the subtle, gradual changes as well as the “mighty” experiences. How do these experiences help you when you face temptation?\nSee also Ezekiel 36:26–27 ; Alma 5:14 ; “A Change of Heart,” “The People of King Benjamin Make a Covenant” (videos), Gospel Library.\nA Change of Heart\nThe People of King Benjamin Make a Covenant | Mosiah 5\nHealing Hands , by Adam Abram\n## I take upon myself the name of Christ as I make covenants with Him.\nMosiah 5:5–15\nWhat do you learn from Mosiah 5:7–9 about what it means to take upon yourself the name of Christ? What do the sacrament prayers (see Moroni 4–5 ) teach about this? How can you show that you “belong” to the Savior?\nSee also D. Todd Christofferson, “ Why the Covenant Path ,” Liahona , May 2021, 116–19.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nMosiah 4:1–3, 10\nTo teach about the joy of repentance, maybe you could let your children get their hands sticky or dirty and notice how they feel after washing. Then you could compare that to the way the people in Mosiah 4:1–3 felt before and after their sins were forgiven. Share your testimony of the Savior’s power to cleanse us spiritually.\nDo your children know how to fully and sincerely repent? Help them find what King Benjamin’s people did in Mosiah 4:1–3, 10 . They could also review “ Repent, Repentance ” in Guide to the Scriptures. How does Jesus Christ make repentance possible?\nMosiah 4:12–26\nServing others makes us feel good. Perhaps your children could talk about a time when they loved or served someone and how that experience made them feel. What are some reasons people might not want to serve others? What could we say to someone to invite them to help people in need? Look for ideas in Mosiah 4:16–26 .\nKing Benjamin taught that when we come unto Christ and receive a remission of our sins, we are “filled with the love of God” ( Mosiah 4:12 ). This leads us to be loving and kind toward others. You and your children could search Mosiah 4:13–16, 26 (or a song like “ I’ll Walk with You ,” Children’s Songbook , 140–41) and find phrases that describe how we can serve others. They could then act out these things or draw pictures of them and guess each other’s phrases. How can we show love and kindness at home, at school, or at church?\nJesus Christ taught us to be kind to others.\nMosiah 5:5–15\nYour children might enjoy creating badges displaying the name “Jesus Christ” and wearing them over their hearts (see this week’s activity page). While they do so, you could read to them Mosiah 5:12 and talk about how making covenants, or promises, with God is like having the name of Christ “written always in [our] hearts.”\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Repentance brings joy.\nMosiah 4:1–3, 10\nTo teach about the joy of repentance, maybe you could let your children get their hands sticky or dirty and notice how they feel after washing.

How can He help us?\nFor more examples of how the Lord helps us, select some verses of “ Book of Mormon Stories ” or “ Nephi’s Courage ” ( Children’s Songbook , 118–19, 120–21) to sing with your children.

Then as you read Mosiah 8:17 to your children, they could put their hands up to their eyes like they’re looking through binoculars each time they hear the word “seer” (see also Moses 6:35–36 ). Talk with them about things that the Lord helps prophets “see” that we can’t. What have our prophets or seers, such as Joseph Smith, revealed to us?\nAfter reading Mosiah 8:16–18 with your children, you could help them think of ways to complete a sentence like A seer is like a … who helps us … . For example, a seer is like a traffic sign who points us to Jesus.\nYou could also make paper footprints and invite your children to draw pictures on them of things that prophets, seers, and revelators have counseled us to do. Place the footprints in a path around the room, and let your children walk on these footprints. How can a seer be “a great benefit” to us? (see Mosiah 8:17–18 ).\nMosiah 9:14–18 ; 10:10–11\nWhen children face challenges, they sometimes feel weak and helpless. How will you help your children rely on the Lord’s strength?

(see Mosiah 9:17–18 ; 10:10 ). How do we receive the strength of the Lord?

Then you could talk about how you feel about the Savior as you study these words and phrases.\nTo teach about Jesus Christ, Abinadi quoted the prophet Isaiah, who compared us to lost sheep. Perhaps your children could share experiences when they lost something or were lost themselves. How did they feel? What did they do? Then you could read together Mosiah 14:6 and 16:4–9 .

How do we write these commandments in our hearts?\nYou could also sing together a song about commandments, such as “ Keep the Commandments ” ( Children’s Songbook , 146–47). What blessings come from keeping the commandments?\nThe scriptures teach us God’s commandments.\n## Heavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to lead me back to Him.\nMosiah 14 ; 16:4–9\nThough it’s a short chapter, Mosiah 14 has several words and phrases that describe Jesus Christ. Maybe you and your children could list them as you read the chapter together. Then you could talk about how you feel about the Savior as you study these words and phrases.\nTo teach about Jesus Christ, Abinadi quoted the prophet Isaiah, who compared us to lost sheep. Perhaps your children could share experiences when they lost something or were lost themselves. How did they feel? What did they do? Then you could read together Mosiah 14:6 and 16:4–9 . How are we like sheep who wander from God? How does Jesus Christ help us come back?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

They had to meet secretly, at great risk, to learn about Him (see verse 3 ). And when given the chance to show their commitment by the covenant of baptism, “they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts” ( Mosiah 18:11 ).\nReading these verses could be a good opportunity to ponder how important your covenants are to you. As you study Mosiah 18:8–14 in particular, consider questions like these:\nWhat do you learn from these verses about the promises you made at baptism? What does God promise you? (see verses 10, 13 ).\nHow does the covenant to serve God relate to our efforts to minister to one another? (see verses 8–9 ).\nWhat does it mean to you to “stand as [a witness] of God”? ( verse 9 ).\nHow does keeping your baptismal covenant help you be “filled with the Spirit”? ( Mosiah 18:14 ). How does the Spirit help you keep your covenant?\nAnswering these questions might lead you to ponder why covenants and ordinances are important to God. You could find insights in Elder Gerrit W. Gong’s message “ Covenant Belonging ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 80–83) or President Jean B.

This could be as simple as showing the picture at the end of this week’s outline and reading about the covenant with them in Mosiah 18:9–10 . Consider inviting a child who has already been baptized to teach this to the younger children. Your children might enjoy hearing about your baptism. How has keeping your covenants with God blessed your life?\nChildren who have been baptized could use frequent reminders about the covenants they made and renew each week with the sacrament. Perhaps your children could compare the baptismal covenant described in Mosiah 18:8–10 with the sacrament prayers (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ). How can we make the sacrament a special, reverent time, just like our baptisms were?\nAlma at the Waters of Mormon\nWe make a covenant with God when we are baptized.\nMosiah 18:17–28\nDo your children know what it means to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? Consider helping them find pictures that represent things Church members did in Mosiah 18:17–28 . For example, the pictures Ordination to the Priesthood and Payment of Tithing ( Gospel Art Book , nos. 106 , 113 ) might represent verses 18 and 27–28 . Tell them why you are grateful to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ.\nHelping children feel “knit together in unity and in love” ( Mosiah 18:21 ) helps them stay connected to the Church throughout their lives. Consider inviting your children to read Mosiah 18:17–28 . What did members of Christ’s Church in Alma’s day do to love and serve one another? How can we do this in our ward, branch, or community? A song about love, such as “ I’ll Walk with You ” ( Children’s Songbook , 140), could reinforce this message.\nMosiah 24:8–17\nA simple object lesson can make learning more memorable. Consider filling a bag with heavy objects (to represent burdens) and inviting a child to hold the bag. As you read Mosiah 24:8–17 with your children, ask them to remove an item from the bag every time they hear about something Alma and his people did to seek God’s help with their burdens.

Study Alma 2:1–7 to find out what the issue was and what the Nephites did about it. What might have happened if “the people of the church” had not made their voices heard? What else do you learn from this account about how the Lord wants you to be involved in your community? (see also Mosiah 29:26–27 ).\nWhat are the important issues facing your community? Consider how you, like the Nephites, can make sure that your voice is included in “the voice of the people.” In what other ways can you, as a follower of Jesus Christ, influence your community for good?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ Love Your Enemies ,” Liahona , Nov. 2020, 26–29.\nAlma 1\nAlthough Nehor eventually confessed that what he taught was false, his teachings continued to influence the Nephites for many years. Why do you think people liked what Nehor taught? In Alma 1:2–6 , look for the lies in Nehor’s teachings—and the truths he used to hide those lies.\nGideon withstood Nehor “with the words of God” ( Alma 1:7, 9 ). Here are some scriptures that refute Nehor’s falsehoods: Matthew 7:21–23 ; 2 Nephi 26:29–31 ; Mosiah 18:24–26 ; and Helaman 12:25–26 . Try summarizing each scripture passage. What have you learned from living prophets that refutes false teachings in our day?\nAlma 1:19–31 ; 4:6–15\nChapters 1 and 4 of Alma describe periods when the Church prospered, but Church members responded to that prosperity differently. For example, compare Alma 1:19–30 with Alma 4:6–15 to see how Church members changed in just a few years. Based on what you’ve read, how do true followers of Jesus Christ feel about people who have different beliefs? What attitude do true followers of Christ have toward riches and prosperity? What do you feel inspired to change about your own attitude?\nLiken the scriptures to yourself. Consider how the stories and teachings of the scriptures apply to your life. For example, you might find similarities between problems you notice today and the problems the Nephites faced in Alma 1–4 .\nAlma 4:6–20\nMaybe you can relate to the sadness Alma felt when he saw what was happening among his people. Look for the problems he saw in Alma 4:6–15 . Have you noticed any similar problems? Perhaps you are worried about a loved one who struggles with these problems. Have you wondered what you could possibly do to help?\nSome might say that Alma, as chief judge, was the best person to solve these problems. But Alma felt there was a better way. As you read verses 16–20 , what impresses you about his approach to helping his people?\nAlma had great faith in the word of God and “pure testimony” ( verse 19 ). What examples have you seen of the power of pure testimony? As you ponder various ways you can share your testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel, you might reread Alma 4:6–14 . What do the actions of Church members in these verses reveal about their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His teachings? What do you notice about the effect of their actions—on themselves and on others?

Study Alma 2:1–7 to find out what the issue was and what the Nephites did about it. What might have happened if “the people of the church” had not made their voices heard? What else do you learn from this account about how the Lord wants you to be involved in your community? (see also Mosiah 29:26–27 ).\nWhat are the important issues facing your community? Consider how you, like the Nephites, can make sure that your voice is included in “the voice of the people.” In what other ways can you, as a follower of Jesus Christ, influence your community for good?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “ Love Your Enemies ,” Liahona , Nov. 2020, 26–29.\n## The word of God can help me recognize false doctrine.\nAlma 1\nAlthough Nehor eventually confessed that what he taught was false, his teachings continued to influence the Nephites for many years. Why do you think people liked what Nehor taught? In Alma 1:2–6 , look for the lies in Nehor’s teachings—and the truths he used to hide those lies.\nGideon withstood Nehor “with the words of God” ( Alma 1:7, 9 ). Here are some scriptures that refute Nehor’s falsehoods: Matthew 7:21–23 ; 2 Nephi 26:29–31 ; Mosiah 18:24–26 ; and Helaman 12:25–26 . Try summarizing each scripture passage. What have you learned from living prophets that refutes false teachings in our day?\n## True disciples of Jesus Christ are “humble followers of God.”\nAlma 1:19–31 ; 4:6–15\nChapters 1 and 4 of Alma describe periods when the Church prospered, but Church members responded to that prosperity differently. For example, compare Alma 1:19–30 with Alma 4:6–15 to see how Church members changed in just a few years. Based on what you’ve read, how do true followers of Jesus Christ feel about people who have different beliefs? What attitude do true followers of Christ have toward riches and prosperity? What do you feel inspired to change about your own attitude?\nLiken the scriptures to yourself. Consider how the stories and teachings of the scriptures apply to your life. For example, you might find similarities between problems you notice today and the problems the Nephites faced in Alma 1–4 .\n## My example and testimony can change hearts.\nAlma 4:6–20\nMaybe you can relate to the sadness Alma felt when he saw what was happening among his people. Look for the problems he saw in Alma 4:6–15 . Have you noticed any similar problems? Perhaps you are worried about a loved one who struggles with these problems. Have you wondered what you could possibly do to help?\nSome might say that Alma, as chief judge, was the best person to solve these problems. But Alma felt there was a better way.

Then you could talk with them about why Satan often combines truths with falsehoods. Help your children think of some examples. In verses 7–9 , how did Gideon withstand Nehor’s lies? (See also “ Chapter 20: Alma and Nehor ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 54–55.)\nGideon, Alma, and Nehor\nAlma 1:19–25\nSome members of the Lord’s Church in Alma’s day were generous and giving, and other members were unkind and prideful. To help your children learn from these experiences, you could read together Alma 1:27, 30 and make a list of the kinds of people members of the Lord’s Church helped. Who do we know who might “[stand] in need” ( Alma 1:30 ) of our love and help? You could also sing together a song about love and service, such as “ Kindness Begins with Me ” ( Children’s Songbook , 145), and help your children think of actions that could go with the song.\nWhat should we do when people are unkind to us? Consider reading with your children how followers of Christ were treated in Alma 1:19–20 . Talk about how they reacted in verses 22 and 25 . Maybe you could practice ways to respond when others are unkind.\nAlma 4:8–20\nOften the “pure testimony” ( Alma 4:19 ) of a child can have a strong influence on others. To help your children discover this, you could read with them Alma 4:8–12, 15 , helping them identify the problems that were happening in the Church. What could Alma do to solve these problems? Help them find out what Alma decided to do in Alma 4:16–20 . Maybe you could share with each other how someone else’s testimony of Christ has strengthened you.\nIf your children need examples of what a testimony is, consider showing a video clip of a speaker in general conference bearing testimony. You could also use this week’s activity page or sing together a song like “ Testimony ” ( Hymns , no. 137). What do we learn about testimonies from these resources? Let your children practice sharing their testimonies.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The Lord can help me recognize false teachings.\nAlma 1:2–9\nOne way to study Alma 1:2–4 with your children is to help them create a true-or-false quiz using statements taught by Nehor, a false teacher.

( Alma 12:14 ).\nWhat does Amulek’s experience teach you about the blessings of having a soft heart? (see Alma 10:1–11 ).\nSee also “Alma Warns Zeezrom” (video), Gospel Library.\nAlma Warns Zeezrom | Alma 12–13\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nAlma 8–10\nThis week’s activity page could help you summarize the events in Alma 8–10 for your children. You might want to help them find principles that made Alma and Amulek good missionaries. For example, they didn’t give up (see Alma 8:8–13 ), they testified of Christ (see Alma 9:26–27 ), and they worked together (see Alma 10:12 ).\nA song about missionary work, such as “ I Want to Be a Missionary Now ” ( Children’s Songbook , 168) could give your children ideas about ways to share the gospel with their friends. Invite them to list ideas they find and people they could share the gospel with. You might even let them role-play what they might say or do.\nEncourage participation. As you prepare to teach, rather than planning things to say, ask yourself, “What will the children do to learn?” Children will learn better and remember longer when they actively participate.\nAlma, Amulek, and Zeezrom\nAlma 11–12\nPerhaps your children could draw a picture representing principles of the plan of redemption, like the Fall of Adam and Eve, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, repentance, death, resurrection, and judgment. Then you could help them match their pictures to verses in Alma 11–12 that teach about these principles.\nAlma 8:18–22\nYou could invite one child to pretend to be Amulek and another to pretend to be Alma as you tell the story in Alma 8:18–22 . How was Amulek a good friend to Alma? Then your children could share how someone has been a friend to them and how that experience made them feel.\nMaybe you could make a friendship puzzle: find or draw a picture representing friendship and cut it into puzzle pieces. On the back of each piece, write something we can do to be a good friend, including things Alma and Amulek did. Your children could take turns selecting a piece and adding it to the puzzle as you read what is written on the back. Who needs our friendship?\nWe can be good friends to others.\nAlma 11:43–44\nConsider an object lesson like this one to teach about the Resurrection: your hand could represent your spirit, and a glove could represent your body. Take your hand out of the glove to show that our spirits and bodies will be separated at death. Then place your hand back in the glove to show that our spirits and bodies will be joined together again at the Resurrection. Let your children take turns putting the glove on and taking it off as you read Alma 11:43 to them. Display a picture of the resurrected Savior (see Gospel Art Book , no. 59 ), and testify that Jesus Christ made it possible for everyone to be resurrected.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## I can share the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nAlma 8–10\nThis week’s activity page could help you summarize the events in Alma 8–10 for your children.

Perhaps you could write down at least one truth for each verse in Alma 13:1–19 . Here are some ideas to get you started:\nVerse 1 . The priesthood is also called “the order of [God’s] Son” (see also Doctrine and Covenants 107:1–4 ).\nVerse 2 . God ordains priests to help people look to His Son for redemption.\nWhat else do you find? How do you feel about the priesthood as you ponder these truths?\nHave you ever thought about priesthood ordinances as a gift from God to help you “look forward to his Son for redemption”? ( verse 2 ; see also verse 16 ). Maybe you could make a list of ordinances you’ve received, such as baptism, confirmation, the sacrament, setting apart for a calling, a blessing of comfort or healing, a patriarchal blessing, and temple ordinances. Ponder your experiences with ordinances like these. Consider the symbolism involved and the Spirit you felt. How does each of these ordinances point you to Jesus Christ for redemption?\nSome people mistakenly believe that ordinances—and the priesthood authority to perform them—aren’t necessary. How would you respond to this idea? Here are two general conference messages that could inform your thinking; pick one, and write down any answers that come to you: Russell M. Nelson, “ Spiritual Treasures ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79; Dale G. Renlund, “ The Priesthood and the Savior’s Atoning Power ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2017, 64–67.\nSee also Doctrine and Covenants 84:19–22 ; Gospel Topics, “ Covenant ,” Gospel Library.\nPriesthood ordinances help us look to Jesus Christ for redemption.\nAlma 13\nThe invitation to “enter into the rest of the Lord” ( Alma 13:16 ) is repeated often in Alma 13 . Maybe you could look for every verse where the word “rest” appears and ponder what each verse teaches you about what “the rest of the Lord” might mean. How is it different from physical rest? How do we find it?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “ Overcome the World and Find Rest ,” Liahona , Nov. 2022, 95–98; “ Come unto Jesus ,” Hymns , no. 117.\nAlma 14\nYou might wonder, as many do, why terrible things happen to people who are trying to live righteously. You may not find all the answers to this difficult question in Alma 14 , but there is much to learn from the way Alma and Amulek responded to tragedy. What do their words and actions teach you about why the Lord sometimes allows righteous people to suffer? What advice might Alma and Amulek give to us when we are experiencing difficult trials?\nSee also Romans 8:35–39 ; 1 Peter 4:12–14 ; Doctrine and Covenants 122:5–9 ; Dale G.

Your children could help you think of ways Jesus used His power (see, for example, Matthew 26:26–28 ; Mark 5:22–24, 35–43 ; Gospel Art Book , nos. 38–41 ). Then you could read Alma 13:2 together and talk about how priesthood power helps us “look forward to [God’s] Son” and become more like Him.\nWhy did God give us priesthood ordinances? Help your children find an answer in Alma 13:16 . If they need help knowing what an ordinance is, there are lists in the General Handbook , 18.1 and 18.2 . Maybe you and your children could talk about your experiences receiving these ordinances. How do they help us “look forward to [Jesus Christ] for a remission of [our] sins”? A song like “ When I Am Baptized ” ( Children’s Songbook , 103) can help your children think of other reasons to be thankful for priesthood ordinances.\nAlma 13:10–12\nAfter reading these verses together, consider ways to help your children visualize what they teach. Maybe you could wash something together. How do we feel when we are dirty? How do we feel when we become clean again? How are these feelings similar to what we feel when we sin and then repent and become clean through the Savior’s Atonement?\nAlma 14:18–29\nThis week’s activity page could help you—or your children—tell the story in Alma 14:18–29 (see also “ Chapter 22: Alma’s Mission to Ammonihah ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 58–63). Emphasize that Alma and Amulek were given strength because of their “faith which [was] in Christ” ( Alma 14:26 ). You could also talk about a time when God gave you strength “according to [your] faith.” How can we be faithful like Alma and Amulek?\nAlma and Amulek in Prison\nAlma 15:3–12\nZeezrom’s change of heart through Jesus Christ is inspiring. Consider reviewing with your children what they learned last week about Zeezrom. Then you could read together Alma 15:3–12 to discover how he changed.

It might help to think of instruments or tools that you might use in your daily life. In Alma 17:6–12 , look for what the sons of Mosiah did so they could be instruments in God’s hands. How can you become a more effective instrument in helping others come unto Christ?\nWhat impresses you about Abish in Alma 19:16–36 ? What do you learn from her about helping others build faith in Christ? For example, what do you feel would help people you love “believe in the power of God”?

You could help your children find what the sons of Mosiah did to build their spiritual strength in Alma 17:2–3 . Then they could draw pictures or find objects that represent these things. Help them plan what they will do to strengthen their testimonies of the Savior.\nAlma 17–19\nTo learn about being an instrument in God’s hands, as the sons of Mosiah were, you and your children could look at an instrument or tool and talk about what it’s used for. Then you could read Alma 17:11 and talk about what it means to be Heavenly Father’s instruments to help people learn about Jesus Christ.\nThis week’s activity page has pictures representing truths Ammon taught King Lamoni. You could help your children find these truths in Alma 18:24–40 . Your children could pretend to be missionaries and share what they know about these truths.\nAfter you read about Abish with your children (see Alma 19:16–20, 28–29 ), they could pretend to be like Abish by running in place, knocking on doors, and telling about what happened in Alma 19:1–17 . How can we be like Abish and share what we know about Jesus Christ and His gospel? Your children could draw pictures of themselves sharing the gospel with someone or sing together a song about sharing the gospel, such as “ Called to Serve ” ( Children’s Songbook , 174–75).\nAbish\nAlma 17:21–25 ; 20:8–27 ; 22:1–3\nAt first, both King Lamoni and his father had hard hearts toward the gospel. Later, their hearts were softened, and they believed in Jesus Christ. How did this happen? Help your children discover answers to this question as you review with them Ammon’s experiences. They could act out “ Chapter 23: Ammon: A Great Servant ” and “ Chapter 24: Ammon Meets King Lamoni’s Father ” ( Book of Mormon Stories , 64–68, 69–70). Or perhaps your children would like to draw pictures of different parts of the story and use the pictures to tell the stories. What did Ammon do to help Lamoni and his father open their hearts to the gospel of Jesus Christ? (see Alma 17:21–25 ; 20:8–27 ; 22:1–3 ).\nAmmon\nThe King of All the Lamanites\nPerhaps you and your children could think of someone who needs to know about Jesus Christ. Help them think of ways they can be good examples and show love to that person, like Ammon did for Lamoni and his father.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## My testimony of Jesus Christ grows when I read the scriptures, pray, and fast.\nAlma 17:2–3\nHow can the examples of Mosiah’s sons help your children build their testimonies of Jesus Christ? You could help your children find what the sons of Mosiah did to build their spiritual strength in Alma 17:2–3 . Then they could draw pictures or find objects that represent these things. Help them plan what they will do to strengthen their testimonies of the Savior.\n## I can share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others.\nAlma 17–19\nTo learn about being an instrument in God’s hands, as the sons of Mosiah were, you and your children could look at an instrument or tool and talk about what it’s used for. Then you could read Alma 17:11 and talk about what it means to be Heavenly Father’s instruments to help people learn about Jesus Christ.\nThis week’s activity page has pictures representing truths Ammon taught King Lamoni. You could help your children find these truths in Alma 18:24–40 . Your children could pretend to be missionaries and share what they know about these truths.\nAfter you read about Abish with your children (see Alma 19:16–20, 28–29 ), they could pretend to be like Abish by running in place, knocking on doors, and telling about what happened in Alma 19:1–17 . How can we be like Abish and share what we know about Jesus Christ and His gospel? Your children could draw pictures of themselves sharing the gospel with someone or sing together a song about sharing the gospel, such as “ Called to Serve ” ( Children’s Songbook , 174–75).\nAbish\n## I can help others come unto Christ by showing my love for them.\nAlma 17:21–25 ; 20:8–27 ; 22:1–3\nAt first, both King Lamoni and his father had hard hearts toward the gospel. Later, their hearts were softened, and they believed in Jesus Christ. How did this happen? Help your children discover answers to this question as you review with them Ammon’s experiences. They could act out “ Chapter 23: Ammon: A Great Servant ” and “ Chapter 24: Ammon Meets King Lamoni’s Father ” ( Book of Mormon Stories , 64–68, 69–70). Or perhaps your children would like to draw pictures of different parts of the story and use the pictures to tell the stories. What did Ammon do to help Lamoni and his father open their hearts to the gospel of Jesus Christ? (see Alma 17:21–25 ; 20:8–27 ; 22:1–3 ).\nAmmon\nThe King of All the Lamanites\nPerhaps you and your children could think of someone who needs to know about Jesus Christ. Help them think of ways they can be good examples and show love to that person, like Ammon did for Lamoni and his father.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

What does it mean to be humble? Help your children find a definition of humble in the Guide to the Scriptures . What other clues about the meaning of these words can we find in Alma 32:13–16 ? Invite your children to complete a sentence like “I am being humble when I .”\nAlma 32:28–43\nSeeds, trees, and fruit are familiar objects that can help children understand abstract principles like faith and testimony. Let your children hold a seed while you read Alma 32:28 . Then you could ask them to help you think of ways that growing a testimony of Jesus Christ is like planting and nourishing a seed (see “ Chapter 29: Alma Teaches about Faith and the Word of God ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 81). Maybe you could plant your seed and talk about what is needed to help a seed—or a testimony—grow.\nChapter 29: Alma Teaches about Faith and the Word of God\nA picture of a tree accompanies this outline; you might use it to illustrate Alma’s words in Alma 32:28–43 .

Or maybe your children could draw a tree on the board and add a leaf or a fruit every time they think of something they can do to help their testimony of Jesus Christ grow.\nYou could let your children try to push a seed (representing the word of God) into a stone (representing a prideful heart) and into soft soil (representing a humble heart). Read together Alma 32:27–28 . Talk about what it means to “give place” ( verse 27 ) for the word of God in our hearts.\nDraw pictures.

But everyone must be “born of God,” though it usually happens gradually ( Alma 36:23 ; 38:6 ). As you read Alma 36 , think about what it means to be born of God.

Wilcox, “ Worthiness Is Not Flawlessness ,” Liahona , Nov. 2021, 61–67; “ Pornography ” in the “Life Help” collection of the Gospel Library.\n## What will happen after I die?\nAlma 40–41\nCorianton had some questions about what happens after death. His concerns led Alma to teach the principles found in Alma 40–41 . As you study, make a list of the truths you find about things like the spirit world, resurrection, and judgment. Consider reading these chapters from the perspective of someone who, like Corianton, needs to repent—after all, that’s true for all of us.\n## I can seek answers to my questions with faith in Jesus Christ.\nAlma 40\nSometimes we might think that prophets know the answer to every gospel question. But notice the unanswered questions Alma had in chapter 40 . What did he do to find answers? What did he do when he didn’t have answers? How can Alma’s example help you?\nPrayer is one way that we can find answers to gospel questions\n## The Atonement of Jesus Christ makes redemption possible.\nAlma 42\nCorianton believed that punishment for sins was not fair (see Alma 42:1 ). In Alma 42 , how did Alma address his concern? You might organize passages in this chapter in two groups: “God is just” and “God is merciful.” How does the Savior’s Atonement make both justice and mercy possible? Look for additional insights in the video “The Mediator” (Gospel Library).\nThe Mediator\nSee also “ How Great the Wisdom and the Love ,” Hymns , 195.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nAlma 39:1, 10–11\nAlma’s counsel to Corianton can help your children understand the importance of being a good example. Consider reading together Alma 39:1 . How was Corianton’s brother Shiblon a good example? Your children could find additional answers to this question in Alma 38:2–4 .\nYou could also play a game in which you and your children take turns following or imitating each other. Use this game to illustrate how our actions could help others make good choices. Sing together “ I Am like a Star ” ( Children’s Songbook , 163), and help your children think of ways they can be a good example.\nWith a flashlight or a picture of the sun, you could compare light to the power of a good example. You and your children could also look at pictures of Jesus doing good things and talk about the example He set for us. The videos “Shine Your Light So Others May See” and “Lessons I Learned as a Boy” can help your children discuss how their example can lead people to Christ.\nShine Your Light So Others May See\nGordon Hinckley: Lessons I Learned as a Boy\nAlma 39:9–13\nWithout going into detail about the nature of his sins, explain that Corianton made a wrong choice. What could we say to help him? Consider reading Alma 39:9 to your children, and help them understand what repent and forsake mean. Testify that repentance is possible through Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\nCorianton\nHere’s an object lesson to illustrate the joy of repentance: Give a child something heavy to hold while you tell a story about someone who did something wrong and felt bad. Tell your children that the object is like the bad feelings we may have when we make a mistake. Take the heavy object from the child as you testify that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can take away the heavy, bad feelings and help us be better as we repent.\nAlma 40:6–7, 11–14, 21–23\nIt’s natural to wonder what happens to us after we die. What can you do to help your children find inspired answers? You could write death , spirit world (paradise and spirit prison) , resurrection , and judgment on separate pieces of paper. Help your children understand what these words mean. As you read together Alma 40:6–7, 11–14, 21–23 , your children could place the words in the order in which they occur in these verses.\nOlder children may benefit from finding answers to questions by searching Alma 40:6–7, 11–14, 21–23 . Consider asking your children questions that can be answered in these verses, such as “What will my body be like when I am resurrected?” Invite them to search for answers in the appropriate verses.\nMary and the Resurrected Lord , by Harry Anderson\nDo your children know someone who has died? Maybe you could talk briefly about that person. Bear your testimony that someday they—and everyone else—will be resurrected because of Jesus Christ.

For instance, find out what they learned about afflictions and humility from boiling eggs and potatoes.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nAlma 53:20–21 ; 56:47–48\nYou can use many resources to share the story of Helaman’s soldiers, including the pictures in this outline and “ Chapter 34: Helaman and the 2,000 Young Warriors ” ( Book of Mormon Stories , 93–94). This week’s activity page can help your children think of ways they can be like the army of Helaman. Consider sharing some of the qualities of the young soldiers from Alma 53:20–21 to get them started. You could also sing together “ We’ll Bring the World His Truth ” ( Children’s Songbook , 172–73).\nA Young Army\nAlma 56:45–48 ; 57:21\nHelaman’s young soldiers looked to their mothers’ faith when they were faced with a great challenge. Perhaps you could read Alma 56:46–48 with your children and invite them to listen for what the mothers of these young men taught them about faith. You might ask them what they’ve learned from their parents—or other faithful adults—about the Savior. Why is it important to obey “with exactness”? ( Alma 57:21 ).\nMothers of a Young Army\nHow can you—like the mothers of the stripling soldiers—make sure your children know of your faith in God? One way is to share how your faith affects your life. For example, how has He “delivered” you when you “did not doubt”?\nAlma 53:10–18\nYour children might be able to talk about a time when someone made and kept a promise with them. How did they feel when the promise was kept? You could read Alma 53:10–18 and invite your children to look for how Helaman, the people of Ammon, and the sons of the people of Ammon made and kept their promises, or covenants. You might share how Heavenly Father blesses you as you keep your covenants.\nAlma 61:3–14\nConsider inviting your children to think about a time when they were accused of doing something they didn’t do. Tell them about how this happened to Pahoran (see Alma 60–61 ; see also “ Chapter 35: Captain Moroni and Pahoran ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 95–97). To learn about how Pahoran reacted, take turns reading verses from Alma 61:3–14 . What did Pahoran do when Moroni accused him? (see Alma 61:2–3, 8–9 ). What do we learn about forgiveness from the Savior’s example? (see Luke 23:34 ).\nCaptain Moroni and Pahoran\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## I can be faithful to God like Helaman’s young soldiers.\nAlma 53:20–21 ; 56:47–48\nYou can use many resources to share the story of Helaman’s soldiers, including the pictures in this outline and “ Chapter 34: Helaman and the 2,000 Young Warriors ” ( Book of Mormon Stories , 93–94).

When they are righteous, God blesses them, and they prosper. After a time, they become prideful and wicked, making choices that lead to destruction and suffering. Then they are humbled and inspired to repent, and God blesses them once again. The pattern repeats itself so often that some call it the “pride cycle.”\nThe “pride cycle”\nLook for examples of this cycle as you read Helaman 1–6 . Here are some questions to help you understand this pattern:\nWhat evidence of pride do you see among the Nephites? (see, for example, Helaman 3:33–34 ; 4:11–13 ). Do you see similar evidence of pride in yourself?\nWhat are the consequences of pride and wickedness? (see Helaman 4:23–26 ). What are the consequences of humility and repentance? (see Helaman 3:27–30, 35 ; 4:14–16 ).\nWhat things did Helaman want his sons to remember? (see Helaman 5:4–12 ). In what ways can remembering these truths help you avoid becoming prideful?\nSee also “ Chapter 18: Beware of Pride ,” Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson (2014), 229–40; “ I Need Thee Every Hour ,” Hymns , no. 98.\nHelaman 3:24–35\nIn Helaman 3 , Mormon described a time of rejoicing when the Church was so blessed that even the leaders were surprised. Based on what you read in verses 24–32 , what do you think led to that joyful state? Not all members continued in the joy, though. Note the differences between the people described in verses 33–35 . What do you learn from their example?\nLook for personal application. The prophet Mormon used the phrase “thus we see” to emphasize important truths as he abridged the Book of Mormon. For example, what did he want us to see in Helaman 3:27–30 ? As you study the scriptures, you might pause occasionally to complete the phrase “and thus we see” regarding what you have read.\nHelaman 5:6–7\nReading Helaman 5:6–7 may inspire you to consider the names you have been given, including family names. What do these names mean to you? How can you honor them? Even more important, consider what it means to bear the Savior’s name (see Moroni 4:3 ). How do you honor that sacred name?\nHelaman 5:12–52\nWhat does it mean to you to “build your foundation” on “the rock of our Redeemer”? ( Helaman 5:12 ). How have you found safety from life’s storms in Jesus Christ? As you read Helaman 5:12–52 , identify how Nephi and Lehi were blessed for building their faith on the rock of their Redeemer.\nSome people find it helpful to visualize what they’re studying. To depict Helaman 5:12 , you could build a small structure on different kinds of foundations. You could then create a “mighty storm” by spraying water on it and using a fan to create wind. What insights does this give you about building your foundation on Jesus Christ? What else do you learn from the video “A Secure Anchor”? (Gospel Library).\nA Secure Anchor\nVerse 50 mentions “the greatness of the evidences” that the Lamanites received. Reading Helaman 5:12–52 might bring to your mind the evidences that God has given you. For example, maybe “a whisper” from the Spirit has strengthened your faith in the Savior ( Helaman 5:30 ; see also Doctrine and Covenants 88:66 ). Or perhaps you’ve been in darkness and cried out to God for greater faith (see Helaman 5:40–47 ). What other experiences have helped you build your foundation on Jesus Christ?\nSee also Russell M.

How can we choose to be humble—and remain that way?\nHelaman 5:12\nConsider using a picture of a temple to start a conversation about why buildings need strong foundations. Or you could look at the foundation of your home or Church building. To emphasize the strength of a rock-solid foundation, your children could try to move a rock by blowing on it. As you read together Helaman 5:12 , ask your children why Jesus Christ is “a sure foundation” for our lives. How can we build our lives on Him? (see Helaman 3:27–29, 35 and Articles of Faith 1:4 ).\nInvite your children to build a tower using blocks or other materials on different kinds of foundations (such as cotton balls or a flat stone). How is the solid foundation like Jesus Christ? They could add a block to the structure for each idea they share about what they can do to follow Him.\nHelaman 5:21–52\nThe voice described in Helaman 5:29–30, 45–47 teaches us one way that the Holy Ghost speaks to us. To help your children understand this truth, consider reading “ Chapter 37: Nephi and Lehi in Prison ” ( Book of Mormon Stories , 99–102). When you talk about the voice the people heard, speak in a soft voice. Repeat the story a few times, and invite the children to whisper with you. Help them think of other ways that the Holy Ghost can speak to us. To reinforce this principle, you could sing together “ The Still Small Voice ” ( Children’s Songbook , 106–7).\nChapter 37: Nephi and Lehi in Prison\nHelaman 5:20–52\nTo emphasize what Helaman 5:20–41 teaches about darkness and light, try reading or summarizing these verses in the dark, using just a flashlight for light. Your children could listen for what the people needed to do so the darkness would be removed. Then turn the lights on, and read verses 42–48 together. What do these verses teach us about repentance?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Heavenly Father wants me to be humble.\nHelaman 3:24, 33–34 ; 4:11–15\nConsider inviting your children to draw their own version of the “pride cycle,” based on the diagram above.

As you read these chapters, pay attention to Nephi’s actions, thoughts, and interactions with the Lord. How does Nephi’s ministry help you understand the role of prophets? Here are a few examples.

Then see what you would add to your definition after reading the entry for “ Prophet ” in the Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library) or “ Follow the Living Prophet ” ( Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson [2014], 147–55).\nDid you notice how bold Nephi was in Helaman 7:11–29 ? Why do you feel prophets sometimes need to speak with boldness like Nephi did? Consider looking for answers in the section titled “ Don’t Be Surprised ” in Elder Neil L. Andersen’s message “ The Prophet of God ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 26).\nWith all of these truths in mind, ponder how the Lord has blessed you through the ministry of His prophets.

But that didn’t happen. Notice the various ways people reacted to the miracle in Helaman 9–10 . For example, you might compare the responses of the five men and the chief judges in Helaman 9:1–20 (see also Helaman 9:39–41 ; 10:12–15 ).

Let them share similar experiences of their own. Then you could read together Helaman 7:20–21 and ask your children what they think it means to forget God. Maybe your children could draw pictures of things that could cause us to forget the Lord and use their drawings to cover a picture of Jesus. Then they could think of things they can do to remember Him. As they share their thoughts, they could take away the drawings one by one until the picture of the Savior is revealed.\nHelaman 8:13–23\nHelp your children search Helaman 8:13–23 to find names of prophets who taught about Jesus Christ. Maybe they can pass around a picture of Jesus each time they find one. What has our living prophet taught about the Savior?\nYou could also sing together a song about prophets, such as “ Follow the Prophet ” ( Children’s Songbook , 110–11). Maybe you and your children could pick a key phrase from the song and write one word from the phrase on each of several paper footprints. Then you could lay the footprints on the floor leading to a picture of the Savior, and your children could follow the footprints toward the picture. How has following the prophet led us to Jesus Christ?\nHelaman 10:1–4\nTo help your children understand what it means to ponder, you could read together “ Ponder ” in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library). What are some other words that are similar to ponder ? Perhaps you could read Helaman 10:1–3 together and replace the word ponder with those other words. Talk with your children about ways to make pondering part of their scripture study.\nHelaman 10:11–12\nNephi obeyed Heavenly Father even when it meant doing something difficult. For an example of this, you and your children could read Helaman 10:2, 11–12 . Maybe your children could act out what Nephi did—walk toward one side of the room (as if they are going home), stop, turn around, and walk toward the other side of the room (as if they are returning to teach the people). What are some things Heavenly Father wants us to do?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\nNephi the Prophet\n## The Lord wants me to remember Him.\nHelaman 7:20–21\nTo start a conversation about remembering the Lord, you could tell your children about a time when you forgot something.

How has following the prophet led us to Jesus Christ?\n## Pondering the words of God invites revelation.\nHelaman 10:1–4\nTo help your children understand what it means to ponder, you could read together “ Ponder ” in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library). What are some other words that are similar to ponder ? Perhaps you could read Helaman 10:1–3 together and replace the word ponder with those other words. Talk with your children about ways to make pondering part of their scripture study.\n## I will obey Heavenly Father.\nHelaman 10:11–12\nNephi obeyed Heavenly Father even when it meant doing something difficult. For an example of this, you and your children could read Helaman 10:2, 11–12 . Maybe your children could act out what Nephi did—walk toward one side of the room (as if they are going home), stop, turn around, and walk toward the other side of the room (as if they are returning to teach the people).

As you study Samuel’s words in Helaman 13 , consider how he is like a watchman for you. What did he say that seems relevant to our day? (see especially verses 8, 21–22, 26–29, 31, and 38 ). For example, what did Samuel teach about repentance? about humility and wealth? about seeking happiness “in doing iniquity”?\nYou might also search recent conference messages for similar warnings the Lord has given through modern prophets. What do you feel inspired to do about these warnings?\nLook for patterns. A pattern is a plan or model that can be used as a guide for accomplishing a task.

Look for these invitations throughout Helaman 13–15 (see especially Helaman 13:6–11 ; 14:15–19 ; 15:7–8 ). What do you learn from these verses about repentance? Some people see repentance as a harsh punishment—something to avoid. In your opinion, how did Samuel want the Nephites to see repentance?\nTo deepen your study, you could read President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ We Can Do Better and Be Better ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 67). How does he define repentance? What blessings of sincere repentance do you find in his message? You might also look for specific things the prophet invited us to change. What is the Holy Ghost telling you that you need to change? Consider writing down the personal revelation you receive.\nHow is repentance different than just changing your behavior? Why is it important to accept God’s invitation to repent?

Perhaps you could ask them to show you different ways to communicate without words (such as gestures or facial expressions). This could lead to a discussion about different ways that Heavenly Father communicates with us. As part of this discussion, you and your children could look at a picture of Samuel the Lamanite (this outline has two) and read Helaman 13:2–5 as your children listen for how God told Samuel what to say.\nMany of us—especially children—need help learning to recognize how and when God is speaking to us. You might tell your children about a time when the Holy Ghost helped you know in your heart what God wanted you to do or say. Explain how you knew that God was communicating with you. Perhaps your children could also share any similar experiences they have had.\nHelaman 14:2–7, 20–25\nSinging together “ Samuel Tells of the Baby Jesus ” ( Children’s Songbook , 36) may be a good way to teach your children what Samuel taught about Jesus Christ.

Perhaps you could also share what modern prophets teach about Him. How do their words build our faith in Him?\nChapter 40: Samuel the Lamanite Tells about Jesus Christ\nHelaman 16:1–6\nYou can build your children’s trust in the prophet by showing them examples of people who were faithful. Some of these are found in Helaman 16:1, 5 . As you read, your children could stand up when they hear something the people did when they believed Samuel’s words. Then, as you read verses 2 and 6 , your children could sit down when they hear something the people did when they did not believe. How can we show that we believe the words of the living prophet?

You could also sing together a song that encourages the children to shine like a light, such as “ I Am like a Star ” ( Children’s Songbook , 163).\nTo encourage your children not to hide their light (see 3 Nephi 12:15 ), let them take turns hiding or covering a lamp or other light. They could uncover the light each time they name something they can do to be a good example to others.\nSophia Stands for Right\n3 Nephi 13:19–21\nReading these verses could prompt a discussion about the things we treasure.

Why is the sacrament sacred to you?\nIn his message “ Always Remember Him ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Feb. 2018, 4–6), President Henry B.

Why is the gift of the Holy Ghost so desirable? As you read these passages, ponder your own desire for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. How can you earnestly seek for that companionship?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## The Savior is my perfect example of ministering.\n3 Nephi 17 ; 18:24–25, 28–32\nAbout 2,500 people were present when the Savior appeared, yet He found a way to minister to them one by one. What do you notice about the way He ministered in 3 Nephi 17 ; 18:24–25, 28–32 ? What needs did He minister to? What attributes made His ministering effective? You might also think about how He ministers to you. How can you follow His example?

How would such an experience affect how you pray? Ponder this as you study 3 Nephi 17:13–22 ; 18:15–25 ; and 19:6–9, 15–36 . What do you learn from Jesus Christ’s example and teachings about prayer? Consider looking for insights about how, when, where, for whom, and why to pray. What other insights do you gain from these verses?\nSee also Doctrine and Covenants 10:5 .\n## I can be filled with the Spirit as I take the sacrament.\n3 Nephi 18:1–12\nWhen we do something often, it can become routine or casual. We sometimes end up doing it without even thinking. How can you keep this from happening with the weekly ordinance of the sacrament? As you read 3 Nephi 18:1–12 , ponder how you can be spiritually “filled” each time you take the sacrament (see also 3 Nephi 20:1–9 ). According to verses 5–7, 11 , what are some things you should “always” do? You might also ponder why Jesus gave us the ordinance of the sacrament—and whether the sacrament is accomplishing His purposes in your life. Why is the sacrament sacred to you?\nIn his message “ Always Remember Him ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Feb. 2018, 4–6), President Henry B. Eyring gave “three suggestions about what you could remember each week when you partake of the sacred emblems of the sacrament.” What stands out to you about his suggestions? What can you do to improve your worship during the sacrament and throughout the week?\nWhat else can you do to worship more meaningfully? You could ask yourself questions like these: “How is the Savior’s sacrifice influencing my daily life?” “What am I doing well as His disciple, and what can I improve?”\nSee also Matthew 26:26–28 ; Jeffrey R. Holland, “ Behold the Lamb of God ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 44–46; “ As Now We Take the Sacrament ,” Hymns , no. 169; “Jesus Christ Introduces the Sacrament” (video), Gospel Library; Gospel Topics, “ Sacrament ,” Gospel Library.\nJesus Christ Introduces the Sacrament to the People  | 3 Nephi 18\nAllow time to ponder. Sometimes, studying the scriptures becomes a blend of reading, praying, and pondering. When you allow quiet time to reflect and speak with God about what you are learning, you can increase the power of His word in your life.\n## I can “hold up” the light of Jesus Christ.\n3 Nephi 18:22–25\nSuppose you had a friend who knew nothing about Jesus Christ except that you are one of His followers. What would your friend conclude about Him, based on your actions? What does it mean to you to “hold up your light that it may shine unto the world”? ( 3 Nephi 18:24 ).

How does the Book of Mormon strengthen your faith in these things?\n## Following the teachings of Jesus Christ leads to unity and happiness.\n4 Nephi 1:1–18\nWhat would it have been like to live in the years following the Savior’s visit? As you study 4 Nephi 1:1–18 , consider listing the blessings the people received. You might also mark or note the choices they made that helped lead to this blessed life. What did Jesus teach them that could have inspired their righteous choices? Here are some examples, but you may find others: 3 Nephi 11:28–30 ; 12:8–9, 21–24, 40–44 ; 13:19–21, 28–33 ; 14:12 ; 18:22–25 .\nPonder what you can do to help your family, ward, or community live in greater unity and happiness. What can you do to help overcome divisions and truly become “one” with other children of God? What teachings of Jesus Christ help you accomplish this goal?\nSadly, the Zion society described in 4 Nephi eventually fell into wickedness. As you read 4 Nephi 1:19–49 , look for the attitudes and behaviors that ended their happiness and unity. What can you do to help eliminate these attitudes or behaviors?\nSee also Moses 7:18 ; D. Todd Christofferson, “ Sustainable Societies ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 32–35; Reyna I.

Why are our names important? Then you could read 3 Nephi 27:3 together, looking for the question that Jesus’s disciples had. Help your children find the answer in 3 Nephi 27:5–8 . Why is the name of the Church important?\nYou could also help your children think of different groups they belong to, such as a family or a Primary class. Ask them what they like about belonging to each group. Then you could sing “ The Church of Jesus Christ ” ( Children’s Songbook , 77) together and talk about why you are thankful to belong to the Savior’s Church.\n3 Nephi 27:13–16\nThe Savior summarized His gospel in 3 Nephi 27 . You might explain to your children that the word gospel means “good news.” What good news do we find in 3 Nephi 27:13–16 ? Use this week’s activity page to teach that the Savior’s Church is built upon His gospel.\n3 Nephi 27:30–31\nConsider playing a game in which someone hides and others try to find him or her. This could lead to a conversation about the joy we feel when someone who was lost is found. After reading 3 Nephi 27:30–31 , you could talk about how to help each other stay close to Heavenly Father so that “none … are lost.”\n4 Nephi\nTo help your children learn about the happiness of the people described in 4 Nephi, you could show them pictures of happy people. Then, as you read together verses 2–3 and 15–17 (or “ Chapter 48: Peace in America ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 136–37), they could point to the pictures when you get to something in the story that brings happiness.\nJesus Goes Back to His Father\nTo help your children practice what is taught in 4 Nephi 1:15–16 , you could present them with situations where people are angry with each other. Invite them to role-play what the situation might be like if we have the “love of God” in our hearts.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ.\n3 Nephi 27:3–8\nTo introduce the importance of the name of Jesus’s Church, talk with your children about their own names.

As you read Mormon 1–6 , look for ways that Mormon’s faith in Jesus Christ made him unique and gave him opportunities to serve and bless others. The following verses might get you started:\nMormon 1:2–3, 13–17 . What differences do you notice between Mormon and his people? What qualities did he have that helped him stay spiritually strong in such a difficult time?\nMormon 2:18–19 . What words did Mormon use to describe the world he lived in? How did he maintain hope despite his surroundings?\nMormon 3:12 . How did Mormon feel about the people around him? What can you do to develop the kind of love he had?\nWhat other verses in Mormon 1–6 highlight Mormon’s faith in Jesus Christ? What opportunities was he given because he chose to stay faithful?\nConsider studying President Thomas S. Monson’s message “ Be an Example and a Light ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2015, 86–88), looking for reasons why it is important for followers of Jesus Christ to stand out or be different. How would you complete sentences like these? “ was an example to me when he [or she] . This helped me want to .”\nMormon could have felt that his example wasn’t making a difference with his people. If you had a chance to talk to Mormon, what would you tell him about how his example has made a difference for you?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “ Quick to Observe ,” Ensign , Dec. 2006, 30–36, or Liahona , Dec. 2006, 14–20; “Something Different about Us: Example” (video), Gospel Library.\nSomething Different About Us: Example\nHelp others share what they learn. When people share what they’ve learned, they strengthen their own faith and the faith of others (see Doctrine and Covenants 88:122 ). Try asking your family or class what experiences they had as they studied God’s word.\nMormon 2:10–15\nWhen Mormon saw his people’s sorrow, he hoped they would repent. But “their sorrowing was not unto repentance” ( Mormon 2:13 )—it was not godly sorrow but worldly sorrow. To understand the difference, consider recording what you learn from Mormon 2:10–15 in a chart like this one:\nGodly Sorrow\nWorldly Sorrow\nComes to Jesus ( verse 14 )\nCurses God ( verse 14 )\nHow do you know if your sorrow is godly or worldly? If you are experiencing worldly sorrow, how can you change it into godly sorrow?\nSee also 2 Corinthians 7:8–11 ; Michelle D. Craig, “ Divine Discontent ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 52–55.\nMormon 3:3, 9\nMormon observed that the Nephites did not acknowledge the ways that the Lord had blessed them. As you read Mormon 3:3, 9 , you might ponder how you are acknowledging God’s influence in your life. What blessings come when you acknowledge His influence? What are the consequences of not acknowledging Him? (see Mormon 2:26 ; Doctrine and Covenants 59:21 ).\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “ O Remember, Remember ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2007, 66–69.\nMormon 5:8–24 ; 6:16–22\nIf you ever feel discouraged about your own sins, Mormon’s description of the Savior standing “with open arms to receive you” could provide reassurance. As you read Mormon 5:8–24 and 6:16–22 , what do you learn about Heavenly Father’s and Jesus’s feelings toward you, even when you sin? How have you felt Jesus Christ reaching out to you with open arms? What do you feel inspired to do as a result?\nSee also “ Come unto Jesus ,” Hymns , no. 117.\n## I can follow Jesus Christ regardless of what other people do.\nMormon 1–6\nBy the time he was only about 10 years old, Mormon was remarkably different from the people around him.

Perhaps you could read Mormon 1:1–3 and your children could listen for how old Mormon was when Ammaron gave him a special mission. You could also help them find in these verses the qualities that Ammaron saw in Mormon. How do these qualities help us follow Jesus Christ?\nBecause Mormon followed Jesus Christ, he was given opportunities to serve and bless others. You could invite your children to read one or more of the following passages and help them share what they learn about Mormon: Mormon 1:1–3 ; 2:1, 23–24 ; and 3:1–3, 12, 20–22 (see also “ Chapter 49: Mormon and His Teachings ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 138–42). How did he follow Jesus Christ? How did his faith in Jesus Christ help or bless others? How can our faith help people we know?\nMormon the Prophet\nMormon 2:8–15\nPerhaps you could make a chart like the one in “Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church” to help your children understand the difference between godly and worldly sorrow as they read Mormon 2:8, 10–15 . Then they could also search Mormon 2:12 to find reasons why repentance should make our “heart[s] … rejoice.” How can we make sure that the sorrow we feel for our sins leads us to seek God’s help to change?\nMormon 3:3, 9\nInviting your children to list (or draw pictures of) some things they are grateful for might be a good way to help them feel gratitude for God. After they have made a list, you could read Mormon 3:3, 9 and explain that Heavenly Father had blessed the Nephites too, but they had not recognized it. What can we do to show we are thankful to Heavenly Father for our blessings?\nMormon 3:12\nEven though the Nephites were wicked, Mormon never stopped loving them. Help your children find the words “loved” and “love” in Mormon 3:12 . You could also sing a song together about loving others, such as “ Jesus Said Love Everyone ” ( Children’s Songbook , 61), while showing pictures of children from around the world. Testify of God’s love for all His children.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Like Mormon, I can follow Jesus Christ.\nMormon 1:1–3 ; 2:1, 23–24 ; 3:1–3, 12, 17–22\nBecause Mormon was quite young when he developed his faith in Christ, he can be an inspiration to your children.

You could also choose several events that both the Bible and the Book of Mormon testify of—such as Jesus’s birth, death, and Resurrection—and invite your children to find pictures of these events (for example, in the Gospel Art Book ).\nTo help your children learn the eighth article of faith , you could write each word on separate pieces of paper. Invite your children to work together to put the words in the correct order and repeat it several times.\nMormon 8:1–7\nMoroni’s example could inspire your children to obey God’s commandments even when they feel alone. After you read Mormon 8:1–7 with them, they could share how they would have felt if they had been Moroni. In verses 1, 3, and 4 , what was Moroni commanded to do, and how did he obey? How can we be more like Moroni?\nMaybe you and your children could talk about situations where they must choose between right and wrong when no one is watching. How does having faith in Jesus Christ help us in these situations? A song like “ Stand for the Right ” ( Children’s Songbook , 159) could add to this discussion.\nMormon 8:24–26 ; 9:7–26\nYou might want to explain to your children that a miracle is something God does to show His power and bless our lives. Then you could read phrases from Mormon 9:11–13, 17 that describe some of God’s miracles, and your children could think of other miracles (pictures from the Gospel Art Book , such as nos. 26 , 40 , 41 , and 83 , can help). Talk about miracles that God has done in your life.\nShow your children a recipe, and talk about what would happen if you left out an essential ingredient. Read together Mormon 8:24 and 9:20–21 to find the “ingredients” that can lead to miracles from God.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The Book of Mormon and the Bible testify of Jesus Christ.\nMormon 7:8–10\nTo emphasize the relationship between the Bible and the Book of Mormon, as Moroni did, you could play a game like this one with your children: Ask them to say “Old Testament, New Testament” when you hold up a copy of the Bible and “Another Testament” when you hold up a copy of the Book of Mormon.

After you read Mormon 8:1–7 with them, they could share how they would have felt if they had been Moroni. In verses 1, 3, and 4 , what was Moroni commanded to do, and how did he obey? How can we be more like Moroni?\nMaybe you and your children could talk about situations where they must choose between right and wrong when no one is watching. How does having faith in Jesus Christ help us in these situations? A song like “ Stand for the Right ” ( Children’s Songbook , 159) could add to this discussion.\n## Jesus Christ is “a God of miracles.”\nMormon 8:24–26 ; 9:7–26\nYou might want to explain to your children that a miracle is something God does to show His power and bless our lives. Then you could read phrases from Mormon 9:11–13, 17 that describe some of God’s miracles, and your children could think of other miracles (pictures from the Gospel Art Book , such as nos. 26 , 40 , 41 , and 83 , can help). Talk about miracles that God has done in your life.\nShow your children a recipe, and talk about what would happen if you left out an essential ingredient. Read together Mormon 8:24 and 9:20–21 to find the “ingredients” that can lead to miracles from God.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine."

You might ask them to help you find truths about these topics in Ether 3:6–16 . To emphasize the truth taught in Ether 3:13, 15 , you could look at a picture of the Savior together and invite your children to point to various parts of His body. They could then point to the same part of their own bodies. You could also sing together a song related to our bodies, such as “ The Lord Gave Me a Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 153). You and your children could talk about why you are grateful for your bodies.\nWe are created in God’s image\nEther 5\nMoroni prophesied that the Three Witnesses would help establish the truth of the Book of Mormon. To teach what a witness is, you could ask your children to describe something they have seen or experienced that others have not. Then as you read Ether 5 together, you could talk about why God uses witnesses in His work. You could also share with each other how you know the Book of Mormon is true and how you can share your witness with others.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Heavenly Father hears and answers my prayers.\nEther 1:33–37 ; 2:16–25 ; 3:1–6\nIf you know a language that your children don’t, give them some simple directions in that language (or play a recording of another language).

What do you learn from Ether 12:5–6 about this idea?\nAs you read Ether 12 , you might make note of every time you find the word “faith.” Consider what each instance teaches about faith. Questions like these may help: What is faith? What does it mean to exercise faith? What are the fruits of faith in Jesus Christ? You could also record your thoughts about witnesses you have gained “after the trial of your faith” ( Ether 12:6 ).\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “ Christ Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains ,” Liahona , May 2021, 101–4.\nLet others share, and sometimes teach. People learn best when they have opportunities to share what they are learning or even teach in a formal setting. Whether at home or at church, consider allowing others, including youth, to teach a part of the lesson.\nEther 12:1–9, 28, 32\nIn addition to profound insights about faith, Ether 12 also has a lot to say about hope. Let these questions guide your study:\nWhat were the reasons that Ether had to “hope for a better world”? (see Ether 12:2–5 ).\nWhat is the purpose of an anchor? What does hope do for your soul that’s similar to what an anchor does for a boat? (see Ether 12:4 ).\nWhat should we hope for? (see Ether 12:4 ; Moroni 7:41 ).\nHow has the gospel of Jesus Christ given you “a more excellent hope”? ( Ether 12:32 ).\nSee also Moroni 7:40–41 ; Jeffrey R. Holland, “ A Perfect Brightness of Hope ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 81–84.\nEther 12:23–29\nWhen we read Moroni’s powerful writings, it’s easy to forget that he worried about his “weakness in writing” and feared that people would mock his words (see Ether 12:23–25 ). If you have ever felt anxious about your own weakness, read about Moroni’s struggles—and the Savior’s response—in Ether 12:23–29 . You might also ponder times when Jesus Christ has helped you recognize your weakness and made you strong—even if He didn’t completely remove it. Also think about weaknesses you are currently struggling with. What do you need to do to receive the Savior’s promise to “make weak things become strong”? ( Ether 12:27 ).\nConsider searching the following passages to see how others in the scriptures gained strength through the grace of Jesus Christ:\nEnoch ( Moses 6:31–34 ; 7:13 )\nMoses ( Exodus 4:10–12 ; 14:31 )\nGideon ( Judges 6:12–16 ; 8:22–23 )\nPeter ( Luke 5:8–10 ; 22:55–62 ; Acts 4:13–21 )\nMoroni ( Ether 12:23–29 )\nJoseph Smith ( Joseph Smith—History 1:28 ; Doctrine and Covenants 35:17 ; 135:3 )\nSee also Gospel Topics, “ Grace ,” Gospel Library; “ The Lord Is My Light ,” Hymns , no. 89.\nEther 13:13–22 ; 14–15\nBeing king of the Jaredites was, historically, a dangerous position. This was especially true for Coriantumr, as many “mighty men … sought to destroy him” ( Ether 13:15–16 ). In Ether 13:15–22 , notice what Coriantumr did to protect himself and what the prophet Ether counseled him to do instead. As you read the rest of the book of Ether, ponder the consequences of rejecting the prophets. What happens to people when “the Spirit of the Lord [ceases] striving with them”? ( Ether 15:19 ). What might the Lord want you to learn from these accounts? Consider what you will do to follow His prophets.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Faith in Jesus Christ can lead to miracles.\nEther 12\nIt’s common today, as it was in Ether’s day, for people to want to see evidence before believing in God and His power. What do you learn from Ether 12:5–6 about this idea?\nAs you read Ether 12 , you might make note of every time you find the word “faith.” Consider what each instance teaches about faith. Questions like these may help: What is faith? What does it mean to exercise faith? What are the fruits of faith in Jesus Christ? You could also record your thoughts about witnesses you have gained “after the trial of your faith” ( Ether 12:6 ).\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “ Christ Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains ,” Liahona , May 2021, 101–4.\nLet others share, and sometimes teach. People learn best when they have opportunities to share what they are learning or even teach in a formal setting. Whether at home or at church, consider allowing others, including youth, to teach a part of the lesson.\n## Jesus Christ gives us “a more excellent hope.”\nEther 12:1–9, 28, 32\nIn addition to profound insights about faith, Ether 12 also has a lot to say about hope. Let these questions guide your study:\nWhat were the reasons that Ether had to “hope for a better world”? (see Ether 12:2–5 ).\nWhat is the purpose of an anchor? What does hope do for your soul that’s similar to what an anchor does for a boat? (see Ether 12:4 ).\nWhat should we hope for? (see Ether 12:4 ; Moroni 7:41 ).\nHow has the gospel of Jesus Christ given you “a more excellent hope”? ( Ether 12:32 ).\nSee also Moroni 7:40–41 ; Jeffrey R. Holland, “ A Perfect Brightness of Hope ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2020, 81–84.\n## Jesus Christ can turn my weakness into strength.\nEther 12:23–29\nWhen we read Moroni’s powerful writings, it’s easy to forget that he worried about his “weakness in writing” and feared that people would mock his words (see Ether 12:23–25 ). If you have ever felt anxious about your own weakness, read about Moroni’s struggles—and the Savior’s response—in Ether 12:23–29 . You might also ponder times when Jesus Christ has helped you recognize your weakness and made you strong—even if He didn’t completely remove it. Also think about weaknesses you are currently struggling with. What do you need to do to receive the Savior’s promise to “make weak things become strong”? ( Ether 12:27 ).\nConsider searching the following passages to see how others in the scriptures gained strength through the grace of Jesus Christ:\nEnoch ( Moses 6:31–34 ; 7:13 )\nMoses ( Exodus 4:10–12 ; 14:31 )\nGideon ( Judges 6:12–16 ; 8:22–23 )\nPeter ( Luke 5:8–10 ; 22:55–62 ; Acts 4:13–21 )\nMoroni ( Ether 12:23–29 )\nJoseph Smith ( Joseph Smith—History 1:28 ; Doctrine and Covenants 35:17 ; 135:3 )\nSee also Gospel Topics, “ Grace ,” Gospel Library; “ The Lord Is My Light ,” Hymns , no. 89.\n## Rejecting the Lord’s prophets puts me in spiritual danger.\nEther 13:13–22 ; 14–15\nBeing king of the Jaredites was, historically, a dangerous position. This was especially true for Coriantumr, as many “mighty men … sought to destroy him” ( Ether 13:15–16 ). In Ether 13:15–22 , notice what Coriantumr did to protect himself and what the prophet Ether counseled him to do instead. As you read the rest of the book of Ether, ponder the consequences of rejecting the prophets. What happens to people when “the Spirit of the Lord [ceases] striving with them”? ( Ether 15:19 ). What might the Lord want you to learn from these accounts? Consider what you will do to follow His prophets.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the Liahona and For the Strength of Youth magazines.\n## Ideas for Teaching Children\nEther 12:6–22\nConsider helping your children repeat with you “Faith is things which are hoped for and not seen” from Ether 12:6 . They might enjoy looking at pictures that show the examples of faith in Ether 12:13–15, 19–21 (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 78 , 85 , and this week’s activity page ). Let your children explain what they know about each story. Here are some questions to help you discuss these examples of faith:\nWhat did these people hope for?\nHow was their faith tested?\nWhat happened because of their faith?\nYou could also share your own experiences exercising faith.\nEther 12:4, 32\nTo understand what Ether 12:4 teaches about hope, you and your children could look at a picture of a boat and an anchor. Why do boats need anchors? What would happen to a boat that does not have an anchor? As you read Ether 12:4 together, talk about how hope helps us the way an anchor helps a boat. Invite your children to draw pictures of a boat and anchor so they can teach others about hope.\nIf your children need a definition of hope , help them find one in Guide to the Scriptures, “ Hope ” (Gospel Library). According to this definition and Ether 12:4, 32 , what should we hope for? (see also Moroni 7:40–42 ). Help your children think of other words for hope , along with words that mean the opposite of hope . You could also share with each other some gospel truths that give you hope.\nEther 12:23–29\nChildren sometimes face situations in which they feel weak, just as Moroni did. Help your children find out why Moroni felt this way in Ether 12:23–25 , and ask them if they have ever had similar feelings. Then invite them to read verses 26–27 to find out how the Lord helped Moroni.\nPerhaps your children could draw a picture of something weak and something strong. Then they could add to their drawing some words and phrases from Ether 12:23–29 that teach them about how the Savior can turn our weakness into strength. Encourage your children to think about a weakness they have and then seek the Savior’s help to become strong. You could also share an experience when the Savior helped you become strong enough to do something hard.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## Faith is believing in things I cannot see.\nEther 12:6–22\nConsider helping your children repeat with you “Faith is things which are hoped for and not seen” from Ether 12:6 . They might enjoy looking at pictures that show the examples of faith in Ether 12:13–15, 19–21 (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 78 , 85 , and this week’s activity page ).

Here are some questions to help you discuss these examples of faith:\nWhat did these people hope for?\nHow was their faith tested?\nWhat happened because of their faith?\nYou could also share your own experiences exercising faith.\n## Hope is like an anchor to my soul.\nEther 12:4, 32\nTo understand what Ether 12:4 teaches about hope, you and your children could look at a picture of a boat and an anchor. Why do boats need anchors? What would happen to a boat that does not have an anchor? As you read Ether 12:4 together, talk about how hope helps us the way an anchor helps a boat.

You could also share with each other some gospel truths that give you hope.\n## Jesus Christ can help me become spiritually strong.\nEther 12:23–29\nChildren sometimes face situations in which they feel weak, just as Moroni did. Help your children find out why Moroni felt this way in Ether 12:23–25 , and ask them if they have ever had similar feelings.

What are some ways a person might “deny the Christ”? ( Moroni 1:2–3 ). Ponder how you can be faithful to Jesus Christ, even when you face trials and opposition.\nMoroni 2–6\nMoroni was running for his life when he wrote these chapters. Why would he bother to write about administrative details like how to perform ordinances? Ponder this as you read Moroni 2–6 . Why do you think these details are important to the Lord? Here are some questions that could guide your study:\nConfirmation ( Moroni 2 ; 6:4 ). What do the Savior’s instructions in Moroni 2:2 teach you about the ordinance of confirmation? How would you explain what it means to be “wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost”? ( Moroni 6:4 ).\nPriesthood ordination ( Moroni 3 ). What do you find in this chapter that could help someone prepare to be ordained to the priesthood? What do you find that would help someone prepare to perform an ordination?\nThe sacrament ( Moroni 4–5 ; 6:6 ). What can you do to make the sacrament the spiritual highlight of your week?\nBaptism ( Moroni 6:1–3 ). What are you doing to continue to meet the qualifications for baptism?\nJesus taught how ordinances should be performed\nBased on what you have learned, how will you change the ways you think about, participate in, or prepare others for these ordinances?\nSee also Doctrine and Covenants 84:20 .\nRole-play. One great way to remember what you are learning is to explain it to others. For example, try role-playing scenarios like this one: A friend isn’t sure she’s ready to be baptized.

What did Church members in Moroni’s time do to strengthen each other? As you read Moroni 6:4–9 , ponder the blessings that come from being “numbered among the people of the church of Christ” ( Moroni 6:4 ).\nYou might also think about the people who attend your ward or branch. Is there anyone who might have special need of your love—perhaps someone who is new or recently returning? How could you help make their experiences at church more like what Moroni described?

Oaks’s message “ The Need for a Church ” ( Liahona , Nov. 2021, 24–25).\nAs you ponder what it means to be “nourished by the good word of God” ( Moroni 6:4 ), it might help to think about the nourishment that a seedling or a baby needs—and what happens if it is neglected. Search Moroni 6:4–9 for ideas about how you can help “nourish” others spiritually. How have fellow disciples helped to nourish you?\nIt’s not obvious to everyone why it’s important to be “numbered among the people of the church of Christ” and to “meet together oft” in Church meetings.

Maybe you could ask your children to find every verse that mentions Him, read these verses, and list what your children learn about the Holy Ghost. You could also share with each other experiences when you felt the Spirit’s influence.\nMoroni 4–5\nReading the sacrament prayers with your children could lead to a discussion about how to have more meaningful experiences with the sacrament. It might help for them to imagine that a friend is coming to sacrament meeting for the first time. How would we explain to our friend what the sacrament is and why it is sacred? Encourage your children to use something from Moroni 4 or 5 in their explanations. Younger children could use this week’s activity page or Gospel Art Book , no. 108 .\nConsider singing a song together that helps your children think about the Savior (such as “ Reverently, Quietly ,” Children’s Songbook , 26). You could also practice sitting reverently during the sacrament.\nMoroni 6:1–3\nWho can be baptized? Help your children find answers to this question in Moroni 6:1–3 . What does it mean to have a “broken heart and a contrite spirit”? ( Moroni 6:2 ). How does this help us prepare for baptism? Consider telling your children how you prepared to be baptized.\nSophia's Baptism Promises\nMoroni 6:4–6, 9\nDo your children know why you like going to church? Reading Moroni 6:4–6, 9 can give you an opportunity to discuss together some of the things we do at church. Maybe they could draw pictures of themselves doing these things (such as praying, teaching, singing, and taking the sacrament).\nAfter reading Moroni 6:4 together, you and your children could look at pictures or examples of nourishing foods and compare nourishing our bodies to being “nourished by the good word of God.” You could also watch the video “Children Sharing the Gospel” (Gospel Library).\nChildren Sharing the Gospel\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.\n## The Holy Ghost is a sacred gift.\nMoroni 2–6\nThe Holy Ghost or the Spirit is mentioned several times in Moroni 2–6 .

You could examine each phrase, asking yourself questions like these: What does this mean? How can I do this better? What experiences have I had with this?\nAs you ponder your personal search for spiritual truth, it might help to learn how others have found truth by the power of the Holy Ghost. Elder Mathias Held described his experience as a new member of the Church (see “ Seeking Knowledge by the Spirit ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 31–33). Elder David F.

Consider giving them slips of paper with the words Read , Remember , Ponder , and Ask written on them. Your children could find these words in Moroni 10:3–4 . What should we read, remember, ponder, and ask to gain or strengthen our testimonies of the Book of Mormon? Your children could also look for similarities between these verses and the song “ Search, Ponder, and Pray ” ( Children’s Songbook , 109).\nYour children could use the picture at the end of this outline to talk about Moroni burying the gold plates (see also “ Chapter 54: The Promise of the Book of Mormon ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 156).

Your children could take turns unwrapping the gifts, reading verses from Moroni 10:9–16 that correspond with the numbers, and identifying each spiritual gift. You could talk about how Heavenly Father wants us to use these gifts to bless His children. You could also help your children notice the gifts that Heavenly Father has given them.\nMoroni 10:32–33\nDo your children know what it means to “come unto Christ”? Maybe you could read Moroni 10:32 and invite them to repeat the phrase with you. They could then close their eyes while you place a picture of Jesus somewhere in the room. Then let them open their eyes, find the picture, gather around it, and talk about ways that we can come unto Christ. Maybe it would help to write down the question What does it mean to come unto Christ? Help them search Moroni 10:32–33 to find possible answers (see also Articles of Faith 1:3–4 ). Work together to list what Christ wants us to do and what He promises to do for us.\nMaybe your children would enjoy making and decorating heart-shaped badges that say “I love God with all my might, mind, and strength” (see Moroni 10:32 ).

What impressions about Jesus Christ come to you as you read these passages and contemplate the symbolism of the signs of His birth? How do the testimonies of these prophets strengthen your testimony of Christ and His mission?\nHere are some other suggestions to help you focus on Jesus Christ at Christmastime:\nDid you know that you can watch messages from previous First Presidency Christmas devotionals in the Gospel Library? Look for them in the “ Christmas Videos ” collection. Consider sharing these messages and music to spread Christmas cheer.\nYou and your family might also enjoy listening to selections from the “ Christmas Music ” collection in the Gospel Library.\nConsider planning activities that you or your family can do in the days leading up to Christmas to feel the Spirit of Christ, such as serving someone or singing Christmas hymns together.

What have you learned from the Book of Mormon this year about the Savior’s power to redeem you? Do any accounts or teachings stand out to you? Consider what the following passages teach you about the Savior’s redeeming mission: 2 Nephi 2:6 ; Alma 7:7–13 ; 11:40 ; and Helaman 5:9 ; 14:16–17 .

You and your children could talk about favorite Christmas gifts you have received or hope to receive. Then they could unwrap the picture of Christ and discuss how He has been a precious gift for us.

Why are we thankful to have the Book of Mormon as a second witness of Jesus’s birth?\nChildren love stories. Stories are one of the best ways to help children learn and remember truths. As you share the story of Jesus’s birth, consider also sharing stories from your life that have helped to strengthen your faith in the Savior.\nAs you and your children conclude your study of the Book of Mormon this year, it might be a good time to share with each other your favorite stories or passages from this sacred book. Looking at some of the pictures in Come, Follow Me or Book of Mormon Stories could help your children remember what they’ve been learning this year. Help them see what these stories teach us about Jesus Christ.\nYou could also give your children a picture of Jesus, or let them draw their own.

Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenants by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nHere are some resources that can help you: 2 Nephi 31 ; special issue of the Friend magazine about baptism; Gospel Topics, “ Baptism ,” Gospel Library.\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child. Help them understand that faith is something that can grow stronger and stronger throughout life. What are some things your child can do to develop stronger faith in Christ before they are baptized?\nWhen your child makes a wrong choice, speak joyfully about the gift of repentance. And when you make a wrong choice, share the joy that comes when you repent. Testify that because Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, He gave us power to change. When your child seeks forgiveness, forgive freely and joyfully.\nTell your child about your baptism. Show pictures and share memories. Talk about how you felt, how your baptismal covenants have helped you come to know Jesus Christ better, and how they continue to bless your life. Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like the following: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something they promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (see Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 ).\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell them about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have. Invite your child to share how they feel. Note the variety of ways the Spirit can speak to people, including ways He speaks to you personally. Help your child recognize moments when they may be experiencing the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nWatch together a few of the videos in the Gospel Library collection titled “ Hear Him! ” Talk together about the different ways the Lord’s servants hear His voice. Invite your child to draw a picture or make a video about how they hear the Savior’s voice.\nTalk about how becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has blessed you. How have you come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you have served others and as others have served you? Help your child think of ways to serve and strengthen others as a member of the Church.\nMake the sacrament a sacred and joyful event in your family. Help your child plan ways to focus on Jesus Christ during the sacrament. How will we show that the sacrament is sacred to us?\nMany issues of the Friend magazine include articles, stories, and activities to help children prepare for baptism and confirmation. Let your child choose some to read and enjoy with you. (See also the collection “ Preparing for Baptism ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library.)\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” ( 2 Nephi 31:17 ).\n## Priesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nThe priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All Church members who keep their covenants—including children—are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families (see General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 3.5 , Gospel Library). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see General Handbook , 2.2 ).\nWe receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. When men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. All of Heavenly Father’s children—His sons and His daughters—will be blessed as they come to better understand the priesthood.\nTo learn more about the priesthood, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Spiritual Treasures ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79; Russell M. Nelson, “ The Price of Priesthood Power ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 66–69; “ Priesthood Principles ,” chapter 3 in General Handbook .\nMake priesthood ordinances a consistent part of your family life. For example, help your child prepare spiritually for the sacrament each week. Encourage your child to seek priesthood blessings when they are sick or need comfort or direction. Make it a habit to point out ways the Lord is blessing your family through priesthood power.\nAs you read the scriptures together, watch for opportunities to discuss how God blesses people through His power. Share your own experiences of when God has blessed you through His priesthood. For examples of blessings we receive from God through the priesthood, see General Handbook , 3.2 , 3.5 .\nLearn the priesthood line of authority of someone in your family. (Melchizedek Priesthood holders can receive a copy of their line of authority by sending an email to LineofAuthority@ChurchofJesusChrist.org ; see also “ Request a Priesthood Line of Authority ” in the Help Center on ChurchofJesusChrist.org .) Talk about why it’s important to know that priesthood authority comes from Jesus Christ Himself. Why does He share it with us?\nTeach your child that after baptism, they can receive priesthood power by keeping the baptismal covenant. Review together President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ Spiritual Treasures ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 76–79). Tell your child how priesthood ordinances have brought God’s power into your life. For a list of some of the ways we are blessed by priesthood power, see General Handbook , 3.5 .\nDiscuss the question “What is a servant of the Lord like?” Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:36–42 , and look for answers. Whenever you notice your child (or someone else) applying one of the principles or attributes in these verses, point it out.\nWhen you or your child uses keys to unlock a door or start a car, take a moment to compare those keys to the keys that priesthood leaders hold. (For a definition of priesthood keys, see General Handbook , 3.4.1 ). What do priesthood keys “unlock” or “start” for us? See also Gary E. Stevenson, “ Where Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood? ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 29–32; “ Where Are the Keys? ” (video), Gospel Library.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nWhen you are set apart for a calling, invite your child to be present, if possible. Let your child see you fulfilling your calling. You might even look for appropriate ways they can help you. Describe how you feel the Lord’s power in your calling.\n## Going to the Temple—Baptisms and Confirmations for the Dead\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including people who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year they turn 12, your child is old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors.\nAttend the temple as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the temple recommend questions together. Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together Malachi 4:6 . Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on FamilySearch.org . Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “ Temple ” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “ Preparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations ” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org .)\n## Receiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel from Heavenly Father to us and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching them the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Gospel Topics, “ Patriarchal Blessings ,” Gospel Library.\nShare with your child your experience of receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how you use the blessing in your life. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nTake time to review together some of the resources in Gospel Topics, “ Patriarchal Blessings .” To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see General Handbook , 18.17 .\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to ChurchofJesusChrist.org , click the account icon at the top right corner of the screen, and select “Patriarchal Blessing.”\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and to share them with your child.\n## Going to the Temple—the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” ( Doctrine and Covenants 95:8 ). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the temple. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there.\nExplore together temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org . Read together articles like “ About the Temple Endowment ” and “ Prepare for the House of the Lord .” Let your child ask any questions they have about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “ Prepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “ Home-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation ”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how they are keeping the baptismal covenant described in Mosiah 18:8–10, 13 . Also help your child notice how the Lord is blessing them. Build your child’s confidence in their ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ. You could use General Handbook , 27.2 , to review the covenants we make in the temple.\n## Serving a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to become a missionary long before you go on a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“ Becoming a Missionary ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2005, 45–46). The experiences your child has becoming a missionary will bless them eternally, not just for the period of time they may serve as a missionary.\nTo learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “ Preaching the Gospel of Peace ,” Liahona , May 2022, 6–7; M. Russell Ballard, “ Missionary Service Blessed My Life Forever ,” Liahona , May 2022, 8–10; Missionary Preparation: Adjusting to Missionary Life , Gospel Library.\nModel how to share the gospel in natural ways. Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive as a member of His Church. Invite others to join your family in Church- and family-related activities.\nLook for opportunities for your family to interact with missionaries. Invite them to teach your friends, or offer to let them teach people in your home. Ask the missionaries about the experiences they’re having and how missionary service is helping them draw closer to Jesus Christ. Also ask what they did (or wish they had done) to prepare to be missionaries.\nIf you served a mission, talk openly and often about your experiences. Or invite friends or family members who served missions to talk about theirs. You could also talk about ways you’ve shared the gospel with others throughout your life. Help your child think of ways they can share the gospel.\nGive your child opportunities to teach your family principles of the gospel. Your child could also practice sharing their beliefs with others. For example, you could discuss questions like “How would we introduce the Book of Mormon to someone who has never heard of it?” or “How would we describe the need for the Savior to someone who is not a Christian?”\nHelp your child become comfortable talking to people. What are some good ways to start a conversation? Encourage your child to learn how to listen to what others say, understand what is in their hearts, and share truths of the gospel that could bless their lives.\nLook for opportunities for your child to learn about other cultures and faiths. Help them recognize and respect the good and true principles in others’ beliefs.\n## Going to the Temple—Sealing\nIn the temple, a husband and wife can be married for eternity. This occurs in an ordinance called sealing. Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your daughter or son, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help them prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nRead together “ The Family: A Proclamation to the World ” in Gospel Library. What does this proclamation teach about happiness in family life and about successful marriages? With your child, choose one of the principles listed in the proclamation to study. You could look up scriptures related to that principle in the Guide to the Scriptures . You could also set goals to apply that principle more fully in your family. As you work on your goals, discuss together the effect that living that principle has on family life.\nWith your child, read President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “ In Praise of Those Who Save ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 77–80). When you get to the section titled “ A Society of Disposables ,” you might look for things in your home that are disposable and other things that are not. Talk about how you treat things differently when you want them to last a long time. What does this suggest about how we should treat marriage and family relationships? What else do we learn from President Uchtdorf’s message about how the Savior can help us build strong marriages and families?\nIf you are married, be open with your child about the things you feel you’re doing well as a couple, the things you’re learning, and the ways you’re trying to improve. If you and your spouse have been sealed in the temple, show your child by example how you strive to keep your covenants with each other and with the Lord. Tell your child how you strive to make Heavenly Father and the Savior the center of your relationship and how They are helping you.\nWhen family decisions need to be made, hold family councils and discussions. Make sure that all family members’ opinions are heard and valued. Use these discussions as an opportunity to model healthy communication and kindness in family relationships, even when not everyone sees things the same way.\nWhen there is disagreement or conflict in the family, demonstrate patience and compassion. Help your child see how handling conflict in Christlike ways can help them prepare for a happy marriage. Read together Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–42 , and talk about how the principles in these verses can be applied to marriage."

Help them think of things that help the seed grow into a large tree, such as water, soil, and sunlight. Help them see that these are like the things we do to grow closer to God throughout our lives—building our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting each day, living our baptismal covenants, and listening to the Holy Ghost.\nShare with the children the story about the firecracker from Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “ How Can Repenting Help Me Feel Happy? ” ( Friend , Dec. 2017, 12–13, or Liahona , Dec. 2017, 70–71; see also the video “Repentance: A Joyful Choice” [Gospel Library]).\nRepentance: A Joyful Choice\nAt various points during the story, invite the children to think about how Elder Renlund might have felt.

Read together Matthew 3:13–17 or “ Chapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized ” in New Testament Stories , 26–29, or watch the corresponding video on Gospel Library.\nChapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized\nLet the children point to things in the pictures that are mentioned in the reading or the video. Tell the children about your love for the Savior and your desire to follow Him.\nListen to or sing a song about baptism, such as “ When Jesus Christ Was Baptized ” ( Children’s Songbook , 102). What do we learn about baptism from the song? Read 2 Nephi 31:9–10 , and invite the children to listen for why Jesus Christ was baptized. Invite them to draw a picture of themselves on their baptism day.\nPreparing for baptism means much more than preparing for an event. It means preparing to make a covenant and then keeping that covenant for a lifetime. Ponder how you can help the children understand the covenant they will make with Heavenly Father when they are baptized, which includes the promises He makes to them and the promises they make to Him.\nExplain that a covenant is a promise between a person and Heavenly Father. As we strive to keep our promises to God, God promises to bless us. Write on the board My Promises to God and God’s Promises to Me . Read together Mosiah 18:10, 13 and Doctrine and Covenants 20:37 , and help the children make a list of the promises they find under the appropriate headings (see also Dallin H.

Stevenson, “ How Does the Holy Ghost Help You? ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2017, 117–20; Gospel Topics, “ Holy Ghost ,” Gospel Library.\nInvite someone who was recently baptized and confirmed to come to class and share what it was like to be confirmed. What does it mean to this person to become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? Help the children think of ways they can keep their baptismal covenant as members of the Church (such as serving others, inviting others to learn more about Jesus, saying prayers in meetings, and so on). Share how doing these things has helped you feel the joy of being a member of Christ’s Church.\nShow a picture of the people at the Waters of Mormon (see Gospel Art Book , no. 76 ), and ask the children to describe what they see in the picture. Tell the story of Alma and his people being baptized there (see Mosiah 18:1–17 ; “ Chapter 15: Alma Teaches and Baptizes ,” Book of Mormon Stories , 43–44, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library).\nChapter 15: Alma Teaches and Baptizes\nReview Mosiah 18:8–9 and invite the children to do actions to help them remember the things the people were willing to do as members of Christ’s Church. Share an experience when you have witnessed members of the Church serving in these ways.\nWhen we are baptized and confirmed, Heavenly Father promises that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]” ( Doctrine and Covenants 20:77 ). This wonderful gift from God is called the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nRead Doctrine and Covenants 33:15 , and ask the children to listen for the special gift that Heavenly Father gives us when we are baptized and confirmed. To help them learn more about how the gift of the Holy Ghost will help them, review together John 14:26 ; Galatians 5:22–23 ; 2 Nephi 32:5 ; 3 Nephi 27:20 . You could also review the article “ The Holy Ghost Is … ” ( Friend , June 2019, 24–25; Liahona , June 2019, F12–F13).\nBefore class, ask the parents of one or more of the children to share how they have been blessed because they have the gift of the Holy Ghost. How does He help them? How do they hear His voice?\nSing together a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “ The Holy Ghost ” ( Children’s Songbook , 105). Help the children understand what the song teaches us about how the Holy Ghost can help us.\nChildren who can recognize the voice of the Spirit will be prepared to receive personal revelation to guide them throughout their lives. Teach them that there are many ways the Holy Ghost can speak to us.\nHelp the children think of different ways we could talk to a friend who lives far away, such as writing a letter, sending an email, or talking on the phone. Teach them that Heavenly Father can speak to us through the Holy Ghost. Use President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “ How Does Heavenly Father Speak to Us? ” to help the children understand the different ways the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds and hearts ( Friend , Mar. 2020, 2–3; Liahona , Mar. 2020, F2–F3).\nShare an experience when the Holy Ghost communicated with you, either through thoughts in your mind or through a feeling in your heart (see Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23 ; 8:2–3 ; see also Henry B. Eyring, “ Open Your Heart to the Holy Ghost ,” Friend , Aug. 2019, 2–3; Liahona , Aug. 2019, F2–F3). Testify to the children that the Holy Ghost can help them in similar ways.\nHelp the children think of times they may have felt the Spirit—for example, when singing a song about the Savior or when doing something kind for others. Help them recognize the spiritual feelings that the Holy Ghost brings. Why do you think the Holy Ghost gives us these feelings?

Teach them that there are many ways the Holy Ghost can speak to us.\nHelp the children think of different ways we could talk to a friend who lives far away, such as writing a letter, sending an email, or talking on the phone. Teach them that Heavenly Father can speak to us through the Holy Ghost. Use President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “ How Does Heavenly Father Speak to Us? ” to help the children understand the different ways the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds and hearts ( Friend , Mar. 2020, 2–3; Liahona , Mar. 2020, F2–F3).\nShare an experience when the Holy Ghost communicated with you, either through thoughts in your mind or through a feeling in your heart (see Doctrine and Covenants 6:22–23 ; 8:2–3 ; see also Henry B.

What can we do to remember Jesus Christ during the sacrament?\nChapter 45: Jesus Christ Teaches About The Sacrament And Prayer\nAsk the children to tell you some things they should always remember to do, such as tying their shoes or washing their hands before they eat. Why is it important to remember these things? Read Moroni 4:3 to the children, and invite them to listen for what we promise to always remember when we take the sacrament. Why is it important to remember Jesus Christ? Help the children understand how the bread and water of the sacrament help us remember what Jesus has done for us (see Moroni 4:3 ; 5:2 ).\nWrite on the board “I promise to …” Read the sacrament prayers to the children (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ). When they hear a promise we make to God, pause and help them complete the sentence on the board with the promise they heard. Help them understand that when we take the sacrament, we are making the same promises we made at baptism.\nWhat does it mean to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ? To help the children answer this question, share an example of something that we put our names on. Why do we put our names on these things? Why would Jesus Christ want to put His name upon us?

Why are these blessings important to us? Testify that these blessings come to us because of Jesus Christ and His priesthood power.\nWrite the following headings on the board: God’s power and God’s power and authority given to men on earth . Ask the children to place pictures under the first heading that help us understand how God has used His power to bless us, such as by creating the world, guiding and directing us, showing us that He loves and knows us, and hearing and answering our prayers (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 3 , 68 , 90 , 111 ). Ask them to place pictures under the second heading that help us understand how worthy men on earth use God’s power and authority to bless us, such as by blessing the sick, baptizing, confirming, administering the sacrament, and sealing families (see Gospel Art Book , nos. 46 , 104 , 105 , 107 , 120 ). Share why you are grateful for the priesthood and the blessings it brings.\nOne of the main ways we receive the blessings of God’s power in our lives is through priesthood ordinances (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:20 ). To help the children learn this truth, you could list the following scriptures on the board: 3 Nephi 11:21–26, 33 (baptism); Moroni 2 (confirmation); Moroni 4–5 (sacrament).

Ask the children how this power could help them.\nWorthy male Church members can be ordained to an office in the priesthood. In addition, whenever a person is set apart for a calling or assigned to help in God’s work, they can exercise delegated priesthood authority. The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by individuals who hold priesthood keys, such as the stake president, the bishop, and quorum presidents. Priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood in doing the work of the Lord.\nRead with the children Mark 3:14–15 , and show them a picture of the event described there (such as Gospel Art Book , no. 38 ). Ask the children if they have ever seen someone be ordained to a priesthood office or get set apart for a calling (or tell them about experiences you have had). How is that similar to what the Savior did with His Apostles? Help the children list on the board priesthood offices or callings that can be given to members of the Church, such as a teacher or leader in an organization. Next to each office or calling, you could write what someone with that office or calling has the authority to do. Tell the children how being set apart by someone with the direction of priesthood keys has helped you serve.\nInvite the children to think of something that you need a key for, such as a car or a door.

In temples, we make sacred covenants with Him, are endowed with priesthood power, receive revelation, perform ordinances for our deceased ancestors, and are sealed to our families for eternity. All of this is possible because of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.\nHow can you help the children you teach recognize the sacredness of the Lord’s house and prepare themselves to be worthy to participate in temple ordinances? Consider reviewing these resources: Doctrine and Covenants 97:15–17 ; Russell M.

Ask the children to look for what the Lord expects of people who enter His holy house. Why do we need to be worthy to enter His house? As part of this conversation, talk to the children about temple recommends, including how to receive one. You could invite a member of the bishopric to share with them what a temple recommend interview is like and the questions that are asked in one.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “Jesus Christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our Heavenly Parents and be with those we love” (“ Come, Follow Me ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 91). Help the children understand that the covenant path includes baptism, confirmation, and the temple endowment and sealing.\nAsk the children to help you review the covenant that we make with God when we are baptized and that we renew when we partake of the sacrament (see Mosiah 18:10 ; Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ). Show a picture of the temple and explain that Heavenly Father has more blessings He wants to give us in the temple.\nDraw a gate leading to a path. Ask the children why they think it is helpful to have a path to walk on. Read together 2 Nephi 31:17–20 , where Nephi compares the covenant of baptism to a gate and invites us to continue on the path after baptism. There are more covenants to make after baptism, including covenants made in the temple. Explain that President Nelson has called this path the “covenant path.”\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for all of God’s children to return to live with Him, even if they die without knowing the gospel. In the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ on their behalf.\nTalk about a time when someone did something for you that you could not do for yourself. Invite the children to share similar experiences. Explain that when we go to the temple, we can receive sacred ordinances such as baptism for others who have died. How are we being like Jesus when we are doing work for the dead? What has He done for us that we couldn’t do for ourselves?\nInvite one or more youth who have been baptized for their ancestors to share their experience. Ask them what it was like in the temple. Encourage them to share how they felt doing this work for their ancestors.\nDraw a tree on the board, including the roots and branches. Ask the children to think of how a family is like a tree. Label the roots Ancestors , label the branches Descendants , and label the trunk of the tree You . Read together this sentence from Doctrine and Covenants 128:18 : “For we without them [our ancestors] cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.” Ask questions like the following: “Why do we need our ancestors? Why do our descendants need us? How have our parents, grandparents, and other ancestors helped us?” Invite the children to search the rest of Doctrine and Covenants 128:18 for a phrase that describes how we can help our ancestors.\nConsider working with the parents of each child to find an ancestor’s name for the child to take to the temple (see FamilySearch.org ).\n## The temple is the house of the Lord.\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children.

If you have been to the temple, share how you have felt the Lord’s presence there, and talk about why the temple is a sacred place to you.\nRead together Doctrine and Covenants 97:15–17 . Ask the children to look for what the Lord expects of people who enter His holy house. Why do we need to be worthy to enter His house? As part of this conversation, talk to the children about temple recommends, including how to receive one. You could invite a member of the bishopric to share with them what a temple recommend interview is like and the questions that are asked in one.\n## In the temple, we make covenants with God.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “Jesus Christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our Heavenly Parents and be with those we love” (“ Come, Follow Me ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 91). Help the children understand that the covenant path includes baptism, confirmation, and the temple endowment and sealing.\nAsk the children to help you review the covenant that we make with God when we are baptized and that we renew when we partake of the sacrament (see Mosiah 18:10 ; Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ). Show a picture of the temple and explain that Heavenly Father has more blessings He wants to give us in the temple.\nDraw a gate leading to a path. Ask the children why they think it is helpful to have a path to walk on. Read together 2 Nephi 31:17–20 , where Nephi compares the covenant of baptism to a gate and invites us to continue on the path after baptism. There are more covenants to make after baptism, including covenants made in the temple. Explain that President Nelson has called this path the “covenant path.”\nAsk the children to help you review the covenant that we make with God when we are baptized and that we renew when we partake of the sacrament (see Mosiah 18:10 ; Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79 ).

In the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ on their behalf.\nTalk about a time when someone did something for you that you could not do for yourself. Invite the children to share similar experiences. Explain that when we go to the temple, we can receive sacred ordinances such as baptism for others who have died. How are we being like Jesus when we are doing work for the dead? What has He done for us that we couldn’t do for ourselves?\nInvite one or more youth who have been baptized for their ancestors to share their experience. Ask them what it was like in the temple. Encourage them to share how they felt doing this work for their ancestors.\nDraw a tree on the board, including the roots and branches. Ask the children to think of how a family is like a tree. Label the roots Ancestors , label the branches Descendants , and label the trunk of the tree You . Read together this sentence from Doctrine and Covenants 128:18 : “For we without them [our ancestors] cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.” Ask questions like the following: “Why do we need our ancestors? Why do our descendants need us? How have our parents, grandparents, and other ancestors helped us?” Invite the children to search the rest of Doctrine and Covenants 128:18 for a phrase that describes how we can help our ancestors.\nConsider working with the parents of each child to find an ancestor’s name for the child to take to the temple (see FamilySearch.org ).\nTalk about a time when someone did something for you that you could not do for yourself.

  55-appendix-c,For Primary—Instructions for Singing Time and the Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation,"","","## Guidelines for the Sacrament Meeting Presentation\nWith the direction of the bishop, the children’s sacrament meeting presentation is normally held during the fourth quarter of the year. As the Primary presidency and music leader, work with the counselor in the bishopric who oversees Primary to plan the presentation.\nThe presentation should allow the children to present what they and their families have learned from the Book of Mormon at home and in Primary, including the Primary songs they have sung during the year. As you plan the presentation, think of ways it can help the congregation focus on the Savior and His teachings.\nUnits with small numbers of children may consider ways in which family members can participate with their children. A member of the bishopric may conclude the meeting with brief remarks.\nAs you prepare the presentation, remember the following guidelines:\nPractices should not take unnecessary time away from Primary classes or families.\nVisuals, costumes, and media presentations are not appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSee General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 12.2.1.2 .\n## Instructions for Singing Time\n5 minutes (Primary presidency): Opening prayer, scripture or article of faith, and one talk\n20 minutes (music leader): Singing time\nThe Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. A list of songs that reinforce these principles is included in this guide.\nAs you teach songs to the children, invite them to share what they have already learned about the stories and doctrinal principles the songs teach. Invite the children to share their thoughts and feelings about the truths found in the songs.\nThe Children’s Songbook is the basic resource for music in Primary. Hymns from the hymnbook and songs from the Friend are also appropriate. The use of any other music in Primary must be approved by the bishopric (see General Handbook , 12.3.4 ).\n## Music for Singing Time\n“ Book of Mormon Stories ,” Children’s Songbook , 118–19\n“ Keep the Commandments ,” Children’s Songbook , 146–47\n“ The Iron Rod ,” Hymns , no. 274\n“ Nephi’s Courage ,” Children’s Songbook , 120–21\n“ I Feel My Savior’s Love ,” Children’s Songbook , 74–75\n“ Choose the Right ,” Hymns , no. 239\n“ I Love to See the Temple ,” Children’s Songbook , 95\n“ When I Am Baptized ,” Children’s Songbook , 103\n“ Easter Hosanna ,” Children’s Songbook , 68–69\n“ A Child’s Prayer ,” Children’s Songbook , 12–13\n“ Have I Done Any Good? ,” Hymns , no. 223\n“ Love One Another ,” Children’s Songbook , 136–37\n“ I Will Be Valiant ,” Children’s Songbook , 162\n“ Help Me, Dear Father ,” Children’s Songbook , 99\n“ Testimony ,” Hymns , no. 137\n“ We’ll Bring the World His Truth ,” Children’s Songbook , 172–73\n“ Follow the Prophet ,” Children’s Songbook , 110–11\n“ I Want to Be a Missionary Now ,” Children’s Songbook , 168\n“ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ,” Children’s Songbook , 228–29\n“ Faith ,” Children’s Songbook , 96–97\n“ As I Search the Holy Scriptures ,” Hymns , no. 277\n“ Home Can Be a Heaven on Earth ,” Hymns , no. 298\n“ The Still Small Voice ,” Children’s Songbook , 106–7\n“ Samuel Tells of the Baby Jesus ,” Children’s Songbook , 36\n“ I’m Trying to Be like Jesus ,” Children’s Songbook , 78–79\n“ Families Can Be Together Forever ,” Children’s Songbook , 188\n“ The Church of Jesus Christ ,” Children’s Songbook , 77\n“ Dare to Do Right ,” Children’s Songbook , 158\n“ I Believe in Christ ,” Hymns , no. 134\n“ Search, Ponder, and Pray ,” Children’s Songbook , 109\n“ Away in a Manger ,” Children’s Songbook , 42–43\n“ He Sent His Son ,” Children’s Songbook , 34–35\n## January\n“ Book of Mormon Stories ,” Children’s Songbook , 118–19\n“ Keep the Commandments ,” Children’s Songbook , 146–47\n“ The Iron Rod ,” Hymns , no. 274\n## February\n“ Nephi’s Courage ,” Children’s Songbook , 120–21\n“ I Feel My Savior’s Love ,” Children’s Songbook , 74–75\n“ Choose the Right ,” Hymns , no. 239\n## March\n“ I Love to See the Temple ,” Children’s Songbook , 95\n“ When I Am Baptized ,” Children’s Songbook , 103\n“ Easter Hosanna ,” Children’s Songbook , 68–69\n## April\n“ A Child’s Prayer ,” Children’s Songbook , 12–13\n“ Have I Done Any Good? ,” Hymns , no. 223\n## May\n“ Love One Another ,” Children’s Songbook , 136–37\n“ I Will Be Valiant ,” Children’s Songbook , 162\n“ Help Me, Dear Father ,” Children’s Songbook , 99\n## June\n“ Testimony ,” Hymns , no. 137\n“ We’ll Bring the World His Truth ,” Children’s Songbook , 172–73\n“ Follow the Prophet ,” Children’s Songbook , 110–11\n## July\n“ I Want to Be a Missionary Now ,” Children’s Songbook , 168\n“ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ,” Children’s Songbook , 228–29\n“ Faith ,” Children’s Songbook , 96–97\n## August\n“ As I Search the Holy Scriptures ,” Hymns , no. 277\n“ Home Can Be a Heaven on Earth ,” Hymns , no. 298\n## September\n“ The Still Small Voice ,” Children’s Songbook , 106–7\n“ Samuel Tells of the Baby Jesus ,” Children’s Songbook , 36\n“ I’m Trying to Be like Jesus ,” Children’s Songbook , 78–79\n## October\n“ Families Can Be Together Forever ,” Children’s Songbook , 188\n“ The Church of Jesus Christ ,” Children’s Songbook , 77\n## November\n“ Dare to Do Right ,” Children’s Songbook , 158\n“ I Believe in Christ ,” Hymns , no. 134\n## December\n“ Search, Ponder, and Pray ,” Children’s Songbook , 109\n“ Away in a Manger ,” Children’s Songbook , 42–43\n“ He Sent His Son ,” Children’s Songbook , 34–35\n## Using Music to Teach Doctrine\nSinging time is intended to help the children learn the truths of the gospel. The following ideas can inspire you as you plan ways to teach the gospel principles found in hymns and Primary songs.\nRead related scriptures. For many of the songs in the Children’s Songbook and the hymnbook, references to related scriptures are listed. Help the children read some of these passages, and talk about how the scriptures are related to the song. You could also list a few scripture references on the board and invite the children to match each reference to a song or a verse from a song.\nFill in the blank. Write a verse of the song on the board with several key words missing. Then ask the children to sing the song, listening for the words that fill in the blanks. As they fill in each blank, discuss what gospel principles you learn from the missing words.\nTestify. Bear brief testimony to the children of gospel truths found in the Primary song. Help the children understand that singing is one way they can bear testimony and feel the Spirit.\nStand as a witness. Invite children to take turns standing and sharing what they learn from the song they are singing or how they feel about the truths taught in the song. Ask them how they feel as they sing the song, and help them identify the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nUse pictures. Ask the children to help you find or create pictures that go with important words or phrases in the song. Invite them to share how the pictures relate to the song and what the song teaches. For example, if you are teaching the song “ The Iron Rod ” ( Hymns , no. 274), you could put pictures throughout the room or under chairs depicting important words from the song (such as iron rod , word of God , guide , temptation , and heaven ). Ask the children to gather the pictures and hold them up in the correct order as you sing the song together.\nShare an object lesson. You could use an object to inspire discussion about a song. For example, the song “ Faith ” ( Children’s Songbook , 96–97) mentions a little seed. You could show the children a seed and talk about how we show faith when we plant a seed; this could lead to a discussion about ways we show faith in Jesus Christ, as described in the song.\nInvite sharing of personal experiences. Help the children connect the principles taught in the song with experiences they have had with these principles. For example, before singing “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95), you could ask the children to raise their hands if they have seen a temple. Invite them, as they sing, to think about how they feel when they see a temple.\nAsk questions. There are many questions you can ask as you sing songs. For example, you can ask the children what they learn from each verse in the song. You can also ask them to think of questions that the song answers. This can lead to a discussion about the truths taught in the song.\nUse simple hand actions. Invite the children to think of simple hand actions to help them remember the words and messages of a song. For example, when you sing the second verse of “ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ” ( Children’s Songbook , 228–29), you could invite the children to point to their eyes, act like butterflies, and cup their hands behind their ears. Ask them to place their hands on their hearts as they sing “Yes, I know Heavenly Father loves me.”"
