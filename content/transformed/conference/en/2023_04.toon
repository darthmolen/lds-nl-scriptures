  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,4,"​You likely remember hearing a letter from the First Presidency read in your ward or branch several weeks ago. That letter announced that next Sunday—Easter Sunday—all wards and branches are to meet for sacrament meeting only, leaving additional time for worship at home as families to commemorate this most important holiday."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,5,"The First Presidency’s letter caught my attention, and it caused me to reflect on the way our family has celebrated Easter through the years. The more I thought about our celebrations, the more I found myself wondering if we are inadvertently shortchanging the true meaning of this holiday, so central to all believers in Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,6,"​Those thoughts led me to ponder the difference between the way we have celebrated Christmas as compared with Easter. During December, we somehow manage to incorporate the fun of “Jingle Bells,” Christmas stockings, and gifts alongside other, more thoughtful traditions—such as caring for those in need, singing our favorite Christmas carols and hymns, and of course opening the scriptures and reading the Christmas story inLuke 2. Every year as we read this beloved story from a large old Bible, our family does what your family probably does—dressed with towels on our heads and shoulders and donning bathrobes to represent Joseph, Mary, and the many who came to worship the baby Jesus, we reenact the treasured Christmas story of the Savior’s birth."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,7,"​Our family celebrations at Easter, however, have been somewhat different. I feel our family has relied more on “going to church” to provide the meaningful, Christ-centered part of Easter; and then, as a family, we have gathered to share in other Easter-related traditions. I have loved watching our children and now our grandchildren hunt for Easter eggs and dig through their Easter baskets."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,8,"But the First Presidency letter was a wake-up call. Not only did they invite all of us to make sure our celebration of the most important event to ever happen on this earth—the Atonement and Resurrection of Jesus Christ—includes the reverence and respect the Lord deserves, but they also gave us more time with our families and friends on Easter Sunday to do so."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,9,"These words of the Prophet Joseph Smith add additional context to the significance of the events surrounding Easter: “The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; andall other thingswhich pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,10,"Lesa and I have discussed ways that our family can do better during the Easter season. Perhaps the question we have asked ourselves is one we could all contemplate: How do we model the teaching and celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Easter story, with the same balance, fulness, and rich religious tradition of the birth of Jesus Christ, the Christmas story?"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,11,It seems we are all trying. I observe a growing effort among Latter-day Saints toward a more Christ-centered Easter. This includes a greater and more thoughtful recognition of Palm Sunday and Good Friday as practiced by some of our Christian cousins. We might also adopt appropriate Christ-centered Easter traditions found in the cultures and practices of countries worldwide.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,12,"New Testament scholar N. T. Wright suggested: “We should be taking steps to celebrate Easter in creative new ways: in art, literature, children’s games, poetry, music, dance, festivals, bells, special concerts. … This is our greatest festival. TakeChristmas away, and in biblical terms you lose two chapters at the front of Matthew and Luke, nothing else. Take Easter away, and you don’t have a New Testament; you don’t have a Christianity.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,13,"​We cherish the Bible for all it teaches us about the birth, ministry, Crucifixion, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ. No three words embody more hope and eternal consequence for all of humankind than those uttered by a heavenly angel on Easter morning at the Garden Tomb: “He is risen.”We are deeply grateful for New Testament scripture that preserves the story of Easter and the Savior’s Easter ministry in Judea and Galilee."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,14,"As Lesa and I continued to ponder and seek ways to expand our family Easter celebration to be more Christ-centered, we discussed what scripture reading tradition we might introduce to our family—theLuke 2equivalent for Easter, if you will."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,15,"And then we had this heavenly epiphany: In addition to the important verses about Easter in the New Testament, we as Latter-day Saints are endowed with a most remarkable Easter gift! A gift of unique witness, another testament of the Easter miracle that contains perhaps the most magnificent Easter scriptures in all of Christianity. I am referring of course to the Book of Mormon and, more specifically, to the account of Jesus Christ appearing to inhabitants in the New World in His resurrected glory."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,16,"The Prophet Joseph Smith described the Book of Mormon as “the most correct of any book,”and beginning with3 Nephi 11, it tells the magnificent story of the resurrectedChrist’s visit to the Nephites, the Savior’s Easter ministry. These Easter scriptures bear record of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,17,"In these chapters, Christ calls twelve disciples, teaches as He did in His Sermon on the Mount, announces that He has fulfilled the law of Moses, and prophesies about the latter-day gathering of Israel. He heals the sick and prays for the people in such a glorious way that “no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,18,"This Easter, our family is going to focus on thefirst 17 verses of 3 Nephi 11, with which you are familiar. You recall the great multitude round about the temple in the land Bountiful who heard the voice of God the Father and saw Jesus Christ descending out of heaven to extend the most beautiful Easter invitation:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,19,"“Arise and come forth unto me, … that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am … the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,20,"“And … the multitude went forth, … one by one … and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, … and did bear record, that it was he. …"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,21,"“And … they did cry out with one accord, saying:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,22,"“Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,23,"Imagine: the Nephites at the temple actually touched the hands of the risen Lord! We hope to make these chapters in 3 Nephi as much a part of our Easter tradition asLuke 2is of our Christmas tradition. In reality, the Book of Mormon shares the greatest Easter story ever told. Let it not be the greatest Easter story never told."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,24,I invite you to look at the Book of Mormon in a new light and consider the profound witness it bears of the reality of the risen Christ as well as the richness and depth of the doctrine of Christ.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,25,"We might ask, How can reading Book of Mormon scriptures at Easter bless our lives and those of our loved ones in a meaningful way? More than one might realize. Anytime we read and study from the Book of Mormon, we can expect remarkable outcomes."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,26,"Recently, Lesa and I attended the viewing of a dear friend, a woman of faith whose life was cut short by illness. We gathered with her family and close friends, exchanging fond memories of this beautiful soul who had enriched our lives."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,27,"While standing away some distance from the casket, conversing with others, I noticed two young Primary-age girls approach the casket and stretch up on their tiptoes—eyes just reaching its edge—to pay their final respects to their beloved aunt. With no one else nearby, Lesa slipped over and crouched down beside them to offer comfort and teaching. She asked how they were doing and if they knew where their aunt was now. They shared their sadness, but then these precious daughters of God, with confidence brimming in their eyes, said they knew their aunt was now happy and she could be with Jesus."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,28,"At this tender age, they found peace in the great plan of happiness and, in their own childlike way, testified of the profound reality and simple beauty of the Resurrection of the Savior. They knew this in their hearts because of thoughtful teachings of loving parents, family, andPrimary leaders planting a seed of faith in Jesus Christ and eternal life. Wise beyond their years, these young girls understood truths that come to us through the Easter message and ministry of the resurrected Savior and the words of the prophets as told in the Book of Mormon."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,29,"I have observed that when President Russell M. Nelson gives a gift of the Book of Mormon to someone not of our faith, including world leaders, he often turns to 3 Nephi and reads about the appearance of the resurrected Christ to the Nephites. In doing so, thelivingprophet is in essence bearing witness of thelivingChrist."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,30,"We cannotstandas witnesses of Jesus Christ until we canbearwitness of Him. The Book of Mormon is another witness of Jesus Christ because throughout its sacred pages, one prophet after another testifies not only that Christ would come but that Hedidcome."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,31,"​I am holding in my hand a copy of the first edition of the Book of Mormon. Doing soalwaysmoves me. For much of my adult life, I have been fascinated, enthralled, and riveted with what young Joseph Smith did to get this sacred book of scripture translated and published. The miracles that had to occur are staggering to contemplate."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,32,"​But that is not why this book moves me. It is because this book, more than any other ever published on this earth, bears witness of the life, the ministry, the teachings, the Atonement, and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. My dear brothers and sisters, studying regularly from this book about Jesus Christ will change your life. It will open your eyes to new possibilities. It will increase your hope and fill you with charity. Most of all, it will build and strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ and bless you with a sure knowledge that He and our Father know you, love you, and want you to find your way back home, with a capitalH."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,33,"Dear brothers and sisters, the time has come, foretold by prophets of old, “when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.”We are seeing the fulfillment of this prophecy before our very eyes, through the witness of Jesus Christ found in the Book of Mormon."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,34,"No book does more to show that:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,35,"Because of Jesus Christ, everything changed."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,36,"Because of Him, everything is better."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,37,"Because of Him, life is manageable—especially the painful moments."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,38,"Because of Him, everything is possible."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,39,"His visit as a resurrected Savior, introduced by God the Father, is a most glorious and triumphant Easter message. It will help our family members gain a personal testimony of Jesus Christ as our Savior and Redeemer, who broke the bands of death."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/11stevenson,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,40,"I close with my testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon and of Jesus Christ as the Son of the living God. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,4,"Five years ago today, we raised our hands to sustain our beloved prophet, President Russell M. Nelson, as President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints―the Lord’s mouthpiece for this remarkable season of growth and revelation. Through him, we have received countless invitations and have been promised glorious blessings if we will center our lives on our Savior, Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,5,"In 2011, while I was serving with my husband as mission leaders in beautiful Curitiba, Brazil, my phone rang during a meeting. Rushing to silence it, I noticed the call was from my father. I quickly left the meeting to answer: “Hi, Dad!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,6,"Unexpectedly, his voice was filled with emotion: “Hi, Bonnie. I need to tell you something. I’ve been diagnosed with ALS.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,7,"My mind swirled with confusion, “Wait! What is ALS?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,8,"Dad was already explaining, “My mind will stay alert while my body slowly shuts down.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,9,"I felt my whole world shift as I began to wrestle with the implications of this grievous news. But on that unforgettable day, it was his last sentence that found a permanent place in my heart. My dear father said with urgency, “Bonnie, never give up an opportunity to testify of Christ.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,10,I have pondered and prayed over Dad’s counsel. I have often asked myself if I fully know what it means to never give up an opportunity to testify of Jesus Christ.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,11,"Like you, I have occasionally stood on the first Sunday of the month and borne a witness of Christ. Many times I have testified of gospel truths as part of a lesson. I have boldly taught truth and declared the divinity of Christ as a missionary."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,12,"Yet this plea felt more personal! It seemed as though he was saying, “Bonnie, don’t let the world overtake you! Stay true to your covenants withthe Savior. Seek to experience His blessings every day, and be able to testify through the Holy Ghost of His power and presence in your life!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,13,"We live in a fallen world, with distractions coaxing our eyes and hearts downward instead of heavenward. Much like the Nephites in3 Nephi 11,we need Jesus Christ. Can you imagine yourself there, among people who had experienced so much chaos and destruction? What would it be like to hear the Lord’s personal invitation:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,14,"“Arise and come forth unto me, that ye maythrustyour hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye mayknowthat I am … the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,15,"“And … the multitude went forth … one by one … and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and did know …and had witnessed for themselves.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,16,"These Nephites eagerly went forward to thrust their hands into His side and feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet so they could witness for themselves that this was the Christ. Similarly, many faithful people we have studied in the New Testament this year had anxiously awaited Christ’s coming. Then they stepped from their fields, workbenches, and dinner tables and followed Him, pressed upon Him, thronged Him, and sat with Him. Are we as anxious to witness for ourselves as the multitudes in the scriptures? Are the blessings we seek less needful than theirs?"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,17,"When Christ physically visited the Nephites at their temple, His invitation was not to stand at a distance and look upon Him, but to touch Him, to feel for themselves the reality of the Savior of humankind. How can we draw close enough to gain a personal witness of Jesus Christ? This may be part of what my father was trying to teach me. While we may not enjoy the same physical proximity as those who walked with Christ during His earthly ministry, through the Holy Ghost we can experience His power every day! As much as we need!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,18,"The young women around the world have taught me so much about seeking Christ and gaining a daily, personal witness of Him. Let me share the wisdom of two of them:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,19,"Livvyhas watched general conference her entire life. In fact, in her home they traditionally watch all five sessions as a family. In the past, conference for Livvy had meant doodling or drifting into the occasional unintended nap. But this past October general conference was different. It became personal."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,20,"This time, Livvy decided to be an active recipient. She silenced notifications on her phone and took notes of impressions from the Spirit. She was amazed as she felt specific things God wanted her to hear and do. This decision made a difference in her life almost immediately."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,21,"Just days later her friends invited her to an inappropriate movie. She reflected, “I felt the words and spirit of conference return into my heart, and I heard myself declining their invitation.” She also had the courage to share her testimony of the Savior in her ward."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,22,"After these events she stated, “The amazing thing is, when I heard myself testify that Jesus is the Christ, I felt the Holy Ghost confirm it again for me.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,23,"Livvy did not skip like a stone over the surface of conference weekend; she dove in, mind and spirit, and found the Savior there."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,24,"And then there isMaddy. When her family stopped attending church, Maddy was confused and not certainwhat to do. She realized something significant was missing. So at age 13, Maddy began attending church alone. Even though being alone was sometimes hard and uncomfortable, she knew she could find the Savior at church and she wanted to be where He was. She said, “In church my soul felt like it was at home.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,25,Maddy held onto the fact that her family had been sealed together for eternity. She started bringing her younger brothers with her to church and studying scriptures with them at home. Eventually her mom began joining them. Maddy told her mom of her desire to serve a mission and asked if her mom could be ready to attend the temple with her.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,26,Today Maddy is in the MTC. She is serving. She is witnessing of Christ. Her example helped leadbothof her parents back to the temple and back to Christ.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,27,"Like Livvy and Maddy, as we choose to seek Christ, the Spirit will witness of Him in many different situations. These witnesses of the Spirit occur as we fast, pray, wait, and continue forward. Our closeness to Christ grows through worshipping frequently in the temple, repenting daily, studying scriptures, attending church and seminary, pondering our patriarchal blessings, worthily receiving ordinances, and honoring sacred covenants. All of these invite the Spirit to enlighten our minds, and they bring added peace and protection. But do we honor them as sacred opportunities to testify of Christ?"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,28,"I have attended the temple many times, but when Iworship in the house of the Lord, it changes me. Sometimes while fasting, I find myself simply going hungry, but other times, Ifeast on the Spirit with purpose. I sometimes have mumbled prayers that are repetitive and routine, but I have also comeeager to receive counsel from the Lord through prayer."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,29,"There is power in making these holy habits less of a checklist and more of a witness. The process will be gradual but will grow with daily, active participation and purposeful experiences with Christ. As we consistently act on His teaching, we gain a testimony of Him; we build a relationship with Him and our Heavenly Father. We begin to become like Them."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,30,"The adversary creates so much noise that it can be difficult to hear the Lord’s voice. Our world, our challenges, our circumstances will not get quieter, but we can and must hunger and thirst after the things of Christ to “hear Him” with clarity.We want to create muscle memory of discipleship and testimony that will bring into focus our reliance on our Savior each day."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,31,"My father has been gone for over 11 years now, but his words are alive in me. “Bonnie, never give up an opportunity to testify of Christ.” I invite you to join me in accepting his invitation. Look for Christ everywhere―I promise He is there!True joy rests on our willingness to come closer to Christ and witness for ourselves."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,32,"We know that in the last days, “every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess” that Jesus is the Christ.I pray this witness will become a normal and natural experience for usnow—that we will take every opportunity to joyfully testify: Jesus Christ lives!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/12cordon,President Bonnie H. Cordon,33,"Oh, how I love Him. How grateful we are for His infinite Atonement, which has “made eternal life a possibility and immortality a reality for [us] all.”I testify of our Savior’s goodness and great glory in His sacred name, even Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,4,"Elder George A. Smith, an Apostle, received counsel from the Prophet Joseph Smith at a time of great difficulty: “He told me I should never get discouraged, whatever difficulties might surround me. If I was sunk in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me, I ought not to be discouraged but hang on, exercise faith, and keep up good courage and I should come out on the top of the heap at last.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,5,"How could the Prophet Joseph say that—to someone who was suffering? Because he knew it was true. He lived it. Joseph repeatedly experienced severe difficulties in his life. However, as he exercised faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement and just kept going, he overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,6,"Today I would like to renew Joseph’s plea not to let discouragement overwhelm us when we face disappointment, painful experiences, our own inadequacies, or other challenges."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,7,"When I say discouragement, I’m not talking about the more debilitating challenges of clinical depression, anxiety disorders, or other illnesses that require special treatment.I’m just talking about plain old discouragement that comes with the ups and downs of life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,8,"I am inspired by my heroes who just keep going—with faith—no matter what.In the Book of Mormon, we read of Zoram, the servant of Laban. When Nephi obtained the brass plates, Zoram was faced with the choice to follow Nephi and his brothers into the wilderness or possibly lose his life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,9,"What a choice! Zoram’s first inclination was to run, but Nephi held him and made an oath that if he would go with them, he would be free and have a place with their family. Zoram took courage and went with them."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,10,"Zoram suffered many afflictions in his new life, yet he pressed forward with faith. We have no indication that Zoram clung to his past or harbored resentment toward God or others.He was a true friend to Nephi, a prophet, and he and his seed dwelt in freedom and prosperity in the promised land. What had been a huge obstacle in Zoram’s path eventually led to rich blessings, due to his faithfulness and willingness to just keep going—with faith."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,11,"Recently I listened to a courageous sister share how she persevered through difficulties.She had some challenges, and one Sunday she was sitting in Relief Society, listening to a teacher who she thought lived a picture-perfect life—totally different from her own. She was tired and discouraged. She felt like she didn’t measure up—or even belong—so she got up and left, planning to never return to church again. Walking to her car,she felt a distinct impression: “Go into the chapel and listen to the sacrament meeting speaker.” She questioned the prompting but felt it again strongly, so she went into the meeting."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,12,"The message was exactly what she needed. She felt the Spirit. She knew the Lord wanted her to stay with Him, to be His disciple, and to attend church, so she did."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,13,"Do you know what she was grateful for? That she didn’t give up. She just kept going—with faith in Jesus Christ, even when it stretched her, and she and her family are being abundantly blessed as she presses forward."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,14,"The God of heaven and earth will help us overcome discouragement and whatever obstacles we encounter if we look to Him, follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost,and just keep going—with faith."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,15,"Thankfully, when we are weak or incapable, the Lord can strengthen our faith. He can increase our capacity beyond our own. I have experienced that. More than 20 years ago, I was unexpectedly called as an Area Seventy, and I felt very inadequate. Following my training assignments, I was to preside at my first stake conference.The stake president and I meticulously planned every detail. Shortly before the conference, President Boyd K. Packer, then–Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, called to see if he could accompany me. I was surprised and, of course, agreed. I asked how he would like to proceed since he would preside. He suggested that we undo the plans and prepare to follow the Spirit. Thankfully, I still had 10 days to study, pray, and prepare."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,16,"With an open agenda, we were on the stand 20 minutes before the leadership meeting began. I leaned over to the stake president and whispered, “This is a wonderful stake.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,17,"President Packer elbowed me gently and said, “No talking.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,18,"I stopped talking, and his general conference talk “Reverence Invites Revelation”came to mind. I observed that President Packer was writing down scripture references. The Spirit confirmed to me that he was receiving impressions for the meeting. My learning experience had just begun."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,19,"President Packer spoke for the first 15 minutes and emphasized the importance of conducting all meetings as guided by the Holy Spirit.He then said, “We will now hear from Elder Cook.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,20,"On my way to the pulpit, I asked how long he would like me to take and if there was a topic he would like me to address. He said, “Take 15 minutes and carry on as you feel inspired.” I took about 14 minutes and shared everything I had on my mind."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,21,"President Packer stood again and spoke for another 15 minutes. He shared this scripture:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,22,"“Speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,23,"“For it shall be given you … in the very moment, what ye shall say.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,24,"Then he said, “We will now hear from Elder Cook.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,25,"I was shocked. I had never considered the possibility that I would be asked to speak twice in one meeting. I didn’t have anything in mind to say. Praying fervently and relying on the Lord for help, somehow, I was blessed with a thought, a scripture, and I was able to speak for another 15 minutes. I sat down totally exhausted."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,26,"President Packer spoke again for 15 minutes about following the Spirit and shared Paul’s teachings that we should not speak “words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.”As you can imagine, I was overwhelmed when he was impressed to say for the third time, “We will now hear from Elder Cook.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,27,"I was empty. I had nothing. I knew it was time to exercise more faith. Slowly, I made my way to the pulpit, pleading to God for help. As I stepped up to the microphone, the Lordmiraculously blessed me to somehow give another 15-minute message."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,28,"The meeting finally ended, but I quickly realized that the adult session would start in one hour. Oh, no! Like Zoram, I sincerely wanted to run, but just as Nephi caught him, I knew President Packer would catch me. The adult meeting followed the very same pattern. I spoke three more times. The next day during the general session, I spoke once."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,29,"After the conference, President Packer said with affection, “Let’s do it again sometime.” I love President Boyd K. Packer and appreciate all that I learned."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,30,"Do you know what I am grateful for? That I didn’t give up—or resist. If I had given in to my desperate desire to escape from those meetings, I would have missed an opportunity to increase my faith and receive a rich outpouring of love and support from my Heavenly Father. I learned of His mercy, the miraculous enabling power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement, and the powerful influence of the Holy Ghost. In spite of my weakness,I learned that I can serve; I can contribute when the Lord is by my side if I just keep going—with faith."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,31,"Regardless of the size, scope, and seriousness of the challenges we face in life, we all have times when we feel like stopping, leaving, escaping, or possibly giving up. But exercising faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ, helps us overcome discouragement no matter what obstacles we encounter."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,32,"Just as the Savior finished the work He was given to do, He has the power to help us finish the work we have been given.We can be blessed to move forward along the covenant path, no matter how rocky it becomes, and eventually receive eternal life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/13cook,Elder Carl B. Cook,33,"As the Prophet Joseph Smith said, “Stand fast, ye Saints of God, hold on a little while longer, and the storm of life will be past, and you will be rewarded by that God whose servants you are.”In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

When Elder Perry and his companion arrived, the sister cautiously directed, “Slide your temple recommends under the door.” Only after seeing the temple recommends would she unbolt multiple locks and open the door.Of course, I am not saying ministering companionships need temple recommends. But I love the thought that as those who honor covenants minister, homes unlock and hearts open."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,27,"Elder Perry also offered practical advice. He said, “Give companionships a reasonable number of assignments, prayerfully chosen, clustered geographically where appropriate so travel time is used well.” He would counsel, “Start with those who most need visits. Build from those most likely to welcome and respond well to visits.” He concluded, “Faithful consistency brings miracles.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,28,"Higher and holier ministeringcomes when we pray for “the pure love of Christ”and follow the Spirit. It also comes as elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies, under the bishop’s direction, oversee ministering efforts, including assigning ministering companionships. Please give our young men and young women needed opportunity to accompany and be mentored by experienced ministering brothers and sisters. And please let our young rising generation inspire ministering brother and sister companions."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,29,"In some places in the Church, we have a ministering gap. More say they are ministering than say they are being ministered to. We do not want checklist concern. But often we need more than a sincere hello in the hall or a casual “Can I help you?” in the parking lot. In many places, we can reach out, understand others where they are, and build relationships when we regularly visit members in their homes. Inspired invitations change lives. When invitations help us make and keep sacred covenants, we draw closer to the Lord and each other."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,30,"It is said that those who understand the true spirit of ministering do more than before, while those who do not understand do less. Let’s do more, as our Savior would. As our hymn says, it is “a blessing of duty and love.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,31,"Ward councils, elders quorums, and Relief Societies, please hearken to the Good Shepherd and help Him “seek that which was lost, … bring again that which was driven away, … bind up that which was broken, … strengthen that which was sick.”We may entertain “angels unawares”as we make room in His inn for all."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,32,"Inspired ministering blesses families and individuals; it also strengthens wards and branches. Think of your ward or branch as a spiritual ecosystem. In the spirit of the Book of Mormon allegory of the olive trees, the Lord of the vineyard and his servants bring forth precious fruit and strengthen each tree by binding together the strengths and weaknesses of all the trees.The Lord of the vineyard and his servants repeatedly ask, “What more can I do?”Together, they bless hearts and homes, wards and branches, through inspired, consistent ministering."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,33,"Ministering—shepherding—makes our vineyard “one body”—a sacred grove. Each tree in our grove is a living family tree. Roots and branches intertwine. Ministering blesses generations. When service is needed, wise bishops and elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies ask, “Who are the ministering brothers and sisters?” Ward councils and ministering interviews ask not only about challenges or problems but also look with eyes to see and rejoice in the Lord’s many tender mercies in our lives as we minister as He would."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,34,"Our Savior is our perfect example.Because He is good, He can go about doing good.He blesses the one and the 99. He is ministering personified. We become more like Jesus Christ when we do “unto … the least of these” as we would unto Him,when we love ourneighbor as ourselves,when we “love one another; as I have loved you,”and when “whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,35,"Jesus Christ ministers. Angels minister.Followers of Jesus Christ “minister one to another,”“rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep,”“watch over [and] … nourish [the people] with things pertaining to righteousness,”“remember … the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted,”let His name be known through our ministry.As we minister as He would, we witness His miracles, His blessings.We obtain “a more excellent ministry.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W. Gong,36,"We may tire physically. But in His service we do “not weary in well-doing.”We diligently do our best, do not run faster than we have strength,but trust, as the Apostle Paul teaches, that “God loveth a cheerful giver.”For God who “ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown.”In other words, God enriches “every thing to all bountifulness.”They “which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/14gong,Elder Gerrit W.

Nelson, our beloved prophet, has profoundly emphasized that our unique responsibility is to help gather scattered Israel and prepare the world for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.The Father of our spirits desires His children to besafely gathered home."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,5,"Our Heavenly Father’s plan for safely gathering His children to our heavenly home is not based on worldly success, economic status, education, race, or gender. Father’s plan is based on righteousness, keeping His commandments, and receiving sacred ordinances and honoring the covenants we make."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,6,"The divinely inspired doctrine that we are all brothers and sisters and “all are alike unto God” underlies this great work of gathering. This doctrine accords with those who deeply desire for people of diverse economic and racial status to experience better lives. We applaud and join in such efforts. Moreover, we desire for all of God’s children to come unto Him and receive the eternal blessings He offers through His gospel.In the Lord’s preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, He declares, “Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,7,"I love that the very first verse in the Doctrine and Covenants includes the people who are on “the islands of the sea.” I have had three specific calls to serve and live on the islands of the sea. I first served as a young missionary to the British Isles, second as a new General Authority in the Philippine Islands, and then as Area President in the Pacific Islands, which includes many Polynesian islands."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,8,"All three of these areas have successfully gathered believers to the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Missionaries first arrived in the British Isles in 1837. This was one year after Joseph Smith’s dedication of the Kirtland Temple, where Moses committed “the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north.”The early success in the British Isles is legendary. By 1851, over half the members of the Church were baptized converts living in the British Isles."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,9,"In 1961, Elder Gordon B. Hinckley visited and initiated full-time missionary efforts in the Philippine Islands. At that time there was only one Filipino Melchizedek Priesthood holder. Amazingly, there are over 850,000 members of the Church today in the Philippine Islands. I admire the Filipino people; they have a deep and abiding love for the Savior."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,10,"Perhaps less well known is the ongoing missionary effort to the Polynesian Islands. It commenced in 1844 when Addison Pratt arrived in what is now French Polynesia.Many Polynesians already believed in eternal families and accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. Today almost 25 percent of Polynesians, in the Polynesian Islands, are members of the Church."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,11,"I once listened to a 17-year-old girl on a distant Tahitian island who was a seventh-generation member. She paid tribute to her ancestors who had been converted in 1845 on Tubuai, twoyears before early Church members arrived in the Salt Lake Valley."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,12,"Our doctrine is clear that there will be a time and a season for all people to receive and to respond to the gospel message. These examples are just a part of a much larger picture. President Nelson has continuously emphasized that the gathering of Israel is “the greatestchallenge, … cause, and … work on earth today.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,13,"Until the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ, including the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the revelation and priesthood keys given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, understanding of the gathering of Israel was fragmentary and limited."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,14,"The distinctive name “Israel” was the title conferred upon Jacob.It came to represent the posterity of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob. The original promise and covenant to Father Abraham is set forth inAbraham 2:9–10, which reads in part:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,15,"“And I will make of thee a great nation, …"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,16,"“And I will bless [all nations] through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,17,"During the Council in Heaven in the premortal existence, the plan of salvation was discussed andsustained. It included certain laws and ordinances of the priesthood instituted before the foundation of the world and predicated upon the gathering.It also included the overriding principle of agency."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,18,"After several centuries as a powerful people, including the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon, Israel was divided. The tribe of Judah and part of the tribe of Benjamin became the kingdom of Judah. The remainder, identified as the ten tribes, became the kingdom of Israel.After 200 years of separate existence, the first scattering of Israel occurred in 721 BC when the ten tribes of Israel were carried away captive by theAssyrian king.They later went to the north countries."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,19,"In 600 BC at the commencement of the Book of Mormon, Father Lehi led a colony of Israelites to the Americas. Lehi understood the scattering of Israel of which he was a part. He is quoted by Nephi as saying that the house of Israel “should be compared like unto an olive tree, whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,20,"In the so-called New World, the history of the Nephites and Lamanites as set forth in the Book of Mormon ends in approximately AD 400. Descendants of Father Lehi are spread throughout the Americas."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,21,"This is clearly described by Mormon in3 Nephi 5:20, which reads: “I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,22,"Clearly the high point in Israel’s chronological history is the birth, message, ministry, and mission of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,23,"After the Savior’s eternity-shaping death and Resurrection, a second well-known scattering of Judah occurred between AD 70 and AD 135 when, due to Roman oppression and persecution, the Jews dispersed throughout the then-known world."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,24,"President Nelson has taught, “The Book of Mormon came forth as a sign that the Lord had commenced to gather [the] children of the covenant.”Thus, the Book of Mormon, translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God, is directed to Lehi’s descendants, scattered Israel, and Gentiles who are adopted into the tribes of Israel. The chapter heading to1 Nephi 22reads in part, “Israel will be scattered upon all the face of the earth—The Gentiles will nurse and nourish Israel with the gospel in the last days.” TheBook of Mormon title pagereads that one of the book’s purposes is for “the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ.” With the Restoration and Book of Mormon, the concept of gathering Israel has greatly expanded."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,25,"Those who accept the gospel of Jesus Christ, regardless of lineage, become part of gathered Israel.With that gathering and the numerous temples built and announced, we are in a unique position to gather Israel on both sides of the veil as never before under the Father’s plan."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,26,"President Spencer W. Kimball, speaking of the literal gathering of Israel, stated: “Now, the gathering of Israel consists of joining the true church and … coming to a knowledge of the true God. … Any person, therefore, who has accepted the restored gospel, and who now seeks to worship the Lord in his own tongue and with the Saints in the nations where he lives, has complied with the law of the gathering of Israel and is heir to all of the blessings promised the Saints in these last days.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,27,“The gathering of Israel now involves conversion.”
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,28,"As viewed through a clear lens, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have the great privilege of loving, sharing, inviting, and helping gather Israel to receive the fulness of the Lord’s covenant blessings. This includes Africans and Europeans, South and North Americans, Asians, Australians, and those upon the isles of the sea. “For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men.”“This gathering shall continue until the righteous are assembled in the congregations of the Saints in the nations of the world.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,29,"No one has addressed the gathering more directly than President Russell M. Nelson: “Anytimeyou doanythingthat helpsanyone﻿—on either side of the veil﻿—take a step toward making covenants with God and receiving their essential baptismal andtemple ordinances, you are helping to gather Israel. It is as simple as that.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,30,"Where is the Church today? In the 62 years since I commenced serving a mission in 1960, the number of full-time missionaries serving under a call from the prophet has increased from 7,683 to 62,544. The number of missions has increased from 58 to 411. The number of members has increased from approximately 1,700,000 to approximately 17,000,000."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,31,"The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily impacted some of our opportunities to share the gospel. It also provided experience using new technology, which will greatly enhance the gathering. We are grateful that members and missionaries are now expanding efforts to gather scattered Israel. Growth continues everywhere, especially South America and Africa. We also appreciate that so many across the world have responded to President Nelson’s powerful invitation for increased missionary service. Nevertheless, our commitment to love, share, and invite can be greatly expanded."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,32,"An essential part of this missionary effort is for individual members to become beacon-light exampleswherever we live.We cannot be in camouflage. Our Christlike example of kindness, righteousness, happiness, and sincere love for all peoples can create not only a guiding beacon light for them but also an understanding that there is a safe harbor in the ordinances of salvation and exaltation of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,33,"Please understand that there are remarkable blessings in sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ. The scriptures speak of joy and peace, forgiveness of sins, protection from temptations, and sustaining power from God.Looking beyond this mortal life, we will be prepared to share the gospel with those “in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,34,"My specific prayer today is for every child, young man, young woman, family, quorum, Relief Society, and class to review how we individually and collectively accept dramatic counsel to help gather Israel that has been issued by the Lord and our beloved prophet."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,35,"We respect agency. In this secular world, many will not respond and participate in the gathering of Israel. But many will, and the Lord expects those who have received His gospel to urgently strive to be a beacon-light example that will help others come to God. This allows our brothers and sisters across the earth to enjoy the supernal blessings and ordinances of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and besafely gathered home."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/15cook,Elder Quentin L. Cook,36,"I bear my sure and certain apostolic witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and our Father in Heaven’s plan for us in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,4,"When I was a young boy, I loved Saturday because everything I did on that day seemed like an adventure. But no matter what I did, it was always preceded by the most important thing of all—watching cartoons on television. One such Saturday morning, as I was standing by the television and flipping through channels, I discovered that the cartoon I expected to find had been replaced by a broadcast of the general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While looking at the television and lamenting that there was no cartoon, I saw a white-haired man in a suit and tie sitting in a nice chair."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,5,"There was something different about him, so I asked my oldest brother, “Who is that?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,6,"He said, “That’s President David O. McKay; he’s a prophet.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,7,"I remember feeling something and somehow knowing that he was a prophet. Then, because I was a cartoon-crazed young boy, I changed the channel. But I’ve never forgotten what I felt during that brief, unexpected revelatory moment. With a prophet, sometimes it only takes a moment to know."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,8,"Knowing by revelation that there is a living prophet on the earth changes everything.It causes one to be uninterested in the debate about when is a prophet speaking as a prophet or whether one is ever justified in selective rejection of prophetic counsel.Such revealed knowledge invites one to trust the counsel of a living prophet, even if we do not fully understand it.After all, a perfect and loving Father in Heaven has chosen the pattern of revealing truth to His children through a prophet, someone who never sought such a sacred calling and who has no need of our help to be aware of his own imperfections.A prophet is someone God has personally prepared, called, corrected, inspired, rebuked, sanctified, and sustained.That is why we are never spiritually at risk in following prophetic counsel."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,9,"Whether we like it or not, all of us were chosen in some fashion in the pre-earth life to be born in these latter days. There are two realities that are associated with the latter days. The first reality is that Christ’s Church will be reestablished on the earth. The second reality is that things are going to get really challenging. The scriptures reveal that in the last days there will be “a great hailstorm sent forth to destroy the crops of the earth,”plagues,“wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, … and iniquity shall abound.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,10,"When I was a child, those prophecies of the last days scared me and caused me to pray that the Second Coming would not come in my lifetime—with some success I might addso far. But now I pray for the opposite, even though the prophesied challenges are assured,because when Christ returns to reign, all of His creations will “lie down safely.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,11,"Current conditions in the world have caused some to panic. As God’s covenant children, we do not need to chase after this or that to know how to navigate through these troubled times. We do not need to fear.The doctrine and principles that we must follow to survive spiritually and endure physically are found in the words of a living prophet.That is why President M. Russell Ballard declared that “it is no small thing … to have a prophet of God in our midst.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,12,"President Russell M. Nelson has testified that “God’s long-established pattern of teaching His children through prophets assures us that He will bless each prophet and that He will bless those who heed prophetic counsel.”So the key is to follow the living prophet.Brothers and sisters, unlike vintage comic books and classic cars, prophetic teachings do not become more valuable with age. That is why we should not seek to use the words of past prophets to dismiss the teachings of living prophets."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,13,I love the parables used by Jesus Christ to teach gospel principles. I would like to share a real-life parable of sorts with you this morning.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,14,"One day I walked into the cafeteria at Church headquarters to have some lunch. After getting a tray of food, I entered the dining area and noticed a table at which all three members of the First Presidency were seated, along with one empty chair. My insecurities caused me to make a quick detour away from that table, and then I heard the voice of our prophet, President Russell M. Nelson, saying, “Allen, there’s an empty chair right here. Come and sit down with us.” And so I did."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,15,"Near the end of the lunch, I was surprised to hear a loud crunching noise, and when I looked up, I saw that President Nelson had stood his plastic water bottle straight up and then flattened it and replaced the lid."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,16,"President Dallin H. Oaks then asked the question I wanted to ask, “President Nelson, why did you flatten your plastic water bottle?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,17,"He replied, “It makes it easier for those who are handling recyclable materials because it doesn’t take up as much space in the recycling container.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,18,"While pondering that response, I heard the same crunching sound again. I looked to my right, and President Oaks had flattened his plastic water bottle just like President Nelson. I then heard some noise to my left, and President Henry B. Eyring was flattening his plastic water bottle, although he had adopted a different strategy by doing it while the bottle was horizontal, which took more effort than with the bottle straight up. Noticing this, President Nelson kindly showed him the bottle-straight-up technique to more easily flatten the bottle."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,19,"At that point, I leaned over to President Oaks and quietly asked, “Is flattening your plastic water bottle a new recycling requirement of the cafeteria?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,20,"President Oaks responded, with a smile on his face, “Well, Allen, you need to follow the prophet.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,21,I’m confident that President Nelson was not declaring some new recycling-based doctrine in the cafeteria that day. But we can learn from the prompt responseof President Oaks and President Eyring to President Nelson’s example and President Nelson’s attentiveness to help teach those involved a better way.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,22,"A number of years ago, Elder Neal A. Maxwell shared some observations and counsel that are prophetically on point with respect to our day:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,23,"“In the months and years ahead, events are likely to require each member to decide whether or not he [or she] will follow the First Presidency. Members will find it more difficult to halt longer between two opinions. …"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,24,"“… Let us leave a record so that the choices are clear, letting others do as they will in the face of prophetic counsel. …"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,25,"“Jesus said that when the fig trees put forth their leaves, ‘summer is nigh.’ … Thus warned that summer is upon us, let us not then complain of the heat!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,26,"The rising generation is growing up in a time when there are more fig leaves and there is more heat. That reality imposes a weightier responsibility on the already risen generation, particularly when it comes to following prophetic counsel. When parents ignore the counsel of the living prophet, they not only lose the promised blessings for themselves but even more tragically teach their children that what a prophet says is insignificant or that prophetic counsel can be picked through in a smorgasbord fashion without concern for the resulting spiritual malnutrition."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,27,"Elder Richard L. Evans once observed: “Some parents mistakenly feel that they can relax a little as to conduct and conformity … that they can ease up a little on the fundamentals without affecting their family or their family’s future. But if a parent goes a little off course, the children are likely to exceed the parent’s example.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,28,"As a generation that has the sacred charge to prepare the rising generation for its prophesied role in the latter days,which role must be fulfilled in a time when the adversary’s influence is at its peak,we cannot be a source of confusion about the importance of following prophetic counsel. It is that very counsel that will allow the rising generation to see “the enemy while he [is] yet afar off; and then [they can make] ready” to withstand the enemy’s attack.Our seemingly small deviations, quiet neglect, or whispered criticisms in response to prophetic counsel may result in our only walking dangerously near the edge of the covenant path; but when magnified by the adversary in the lives of the rising generation, such actions may influence them to leave that path altogether. Such a result is a generational price that is too high."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,29,"Some of you may feel you have fallen short in your efforts to follow the counsel of President Russell M. Nelson. If that is the case, then repent; begin again to follow the counsel of God’s chosen prophet. Set aside the distraction of childish cartoons and trust the Lord’s anointed. Rejoice because once again “there is a prophet in Israel.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,30,"Even if you are unsure, I witness that we can withstand the heat of the latter days and even thrive in them. We are the Saints of the latter days, and these are great days. We were anxious to come to the earth at this time, having confidence that we would not be left to stumble when confronted by the adversary’s increasingly darker and more confusing mistsbut rather to take counsel and direction from he who is authorized to say to us and the entire world, “Thus saith the Lord God.”In the sacred name of the prophet whom God raised up, the Holy One of Israel,even Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/16haynie,Elder Allen D. Haynie,32,"President Russell M. Nelson recently invited the students at Brigham Young University to have the same personal revelatory experience: “Ask your Heavenly Father if we truly are the Lord’s apostles and prophets. Ask if we have received revelation on this and other matters” (“The Love and Laws of God” [Brigham Young University devotional, Sept. 17, 2019], speeches.byu.edu). See also Neil L. Andersen, “The Prophet of God,”EnsignorLiahona, May 2018, 26–27: “We have the privilege as Latter-day Saints to receive a personal witness that President Nelson’s call is from God.” The story of Alma’s conversion from listening to the prophet Abinadi provides further evidence that revelation concerning a prophet is available to all of us (seeMosiah 13:5;17:2)."

If someone you trusted handed you what appeared to be nothing more than sand with the promise that it contained gold, you might wisely hold it in your hand awhile, shaking it gently. Every time I have done that with counsel from a prophet, after a time the gold flakes have begun to appear and I have been grateful” (Henry B.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,22,"First, the gift of peace is givenafterwe have the faith to keep His commandments. For those who are covenant members of the Lord’s Church,obedience is what we have already promised to do."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,23,"Second, the Holy Ghost will come and abide with us. The Lord says that as we continue to be faithful, the Holy Ghost will dwell in us. That is the promise in the sacramental prayer that the Spirit will be our companion and that we will feel, in our hearts and minds, His comfort."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,24,"Third, the Savior promises that as we keep our covenants, we can feel the love of the Father and the Son for each other and for us. We can feel Their closeness in our mortal lives, just as we will when we are blessed to be with Them forever."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,25,"Fourth, keeping the Lord’s commandments requires more than obedience. We are to love God with all our heart, might, mind, and soul."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,26,Those who do not love Him do not keep His commandments. And so they will not have the gift of peace in this life and in the world to come.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,27,"Fifth, it is clear that the Lord loved us enough to pay the price of our sins so that we can—through our faith in Him and our repentance, through the effects of His Atonement—have the gift of the peace that “passeth all understanding,”in this life and with Him eternally."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,28,"Some of you, perhaps many, are not feeling the peace the Lord promised. You may have prayed for personal peace and spiritual comfort. Yet you may feel that the heavens are silent to your pleading for peace."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,29,There is an enemy of your soul who does not want you and those you love to find peace. He cannot enjoy it. He works to prevent you from even wanting to find the peace the Savior and our Heavenly Father desire you to have.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,30,"Satan’s efforts to sow hatred and contention all around us seem to be increasing. We see evidence of it happening among nations and cities, in neighborhoods, in electronic media, and all across the world."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,31,"Yet there is reason for optimism: it is that the Light of Christ is placed in every newborn child. With that universal gift comes a sense of what is right, a desire to love and be loved. There is an inborn sense of justice and truth in every child of God as he or she comes into mortality."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,32,"Our optimism for personal peace for those children lies in the people who care for them. If those who rear them and serve them have worked to receive the gift of peace from the Savior, they will, by personal example and effort, encourage the faith of the child to qualify for the supernal gift of peace."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,33,"That is what the scripture promises: “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”It will require the one charged with the child’s careand nurturing to be worthy of the gift of peace."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,34,"Sadly, we all have felt the pain when children raised by inspired parents—sometimes one parent alone—choose, after a lifetime of faith and peace, to take the path of sorrow."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,35,"Even when that sadness occurs, my optimism rests in another gift from the Lord. It is this: that He raises up many peacemakers among His trusted disciples. They have felt the peace and the love of God. They have the Holy Ghost in their hearts, and the Lord can guide them to reach out to the wandering sheep."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,36,"I have seen it over my lifetime and across the world. You have seen it as well. At times, when you are being led to the rescue, it may seem accidental."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,37,"Once, I simply asked someone I met on a trip, “Would you tell me a little about your family?” The conversation led me to ask to see a picture of her adult daughter, who she said was struggling. I was struck with the goodness in the face of that girl in the picture. I felt impressed to ask if I could have her email address. The daughter was at that moment lost and wondering if God had any message for her. He did. It was this: “The Lord loves you. He always has. The Lord wants you to come back. Your promised blessings are still in place.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,38,"Members across the Church have felt the Lord’s gift of personal peace. He is encouraging everyone to help others have opportunities to come unto Him and qualify for that same peace themselves. They, in turn, will choose to seek inspiration to know how they can pass that gift along to others."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,39,"The rising generation will become the nurturers of the generation to follow. The multiplier effect will produce a miracle. It will spread and grow over time, and the Lord’s kingdom on earth will be prepared and ready to greet Him with shouts of hosanna. There will be peace on earth."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,40,I bear my sure witness the Savior lives and that He leads this Church. I have felt His love in my life and His love and concern for all of Heavenly Father’s children. The Savior’s invitation to come to Him is an offer of peace.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,41,"President Russell M. Nelson is the living prophet of God in all the earth. He has said, “I give you my assurance that regardless of the world’s condition and your personal circumstances, you can face the future with optimism and joy.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,42,I express my love to you. Your great faith and love are reaching people and allowing the Lord to change hearts and so gain a desire to offer others the gift of peace that passes all understanding.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/17eyring,President Henry B. Eyring,43,"I pray that you may find peace, help many others to find it, and pass it along. There will be a wonderful thousand years of peace when the Lord comes again. I so testify in joy and in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,4,"Last November, I had the privilege of dedicating the Belém Brazil Temple. It was a joy to be with the consecrated members of the Church in northern Brazil. At that time, I learned that Belém is the gateway to the region that includes the most powerful river in the world, the Amazon River."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,5,"Despite the river’s strength, twice a year something seemingly unnatural happens. When the sun, moon, and earth are aligned just so, a powerful tidal wave flows up the river, against the natural flow of the water. Waves up to 6 meters hightraveling as far as 50 kilometersupstream have been documented. This phenomenon, known generally as a tidal bore, is referred to locally aspororoca, or “great roar,” because of the loud noise it makes. We can correctly conclude that even the mighty Amazon must yield to heavenly powers."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,6,"Like the Amazon, we have a natural flow to our lives; we tend to do what comes naturally. Like the Amazon, with heavenly help we can do seemingly unnatural things. After all, it is not natural for us to be humble, meek, or willing to submit our wills to God. Yet only by doing so can we be transformed, return to live in the presence of God, and achieve our eternal destiny."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,7,"Unlike the Amazon, we can choose whether we yield to heavenly powers or “go with the flow.”Going against the flow may be difficult. But when we yield “to the enticings of the Holy Spirit” and put off the selfish tendencies of the natural man or woman,we can receive the Savior’s transforming power in our lives, the power to do difficult things."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,8,"President Russell M. Nelson taught us how to do this. He promised, “Each person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples—and keeps them—has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ … [to lift] us above the pull of this fallen world.”In other words, we can access the power of God, but only when we connect with Him through sacred covenants."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,9,"Before the earth was created, God established covenants as the mechanism by which we, His children, could unite ourselves to Him. Based on eternal, unchanging law, He specified the nonnegotiable conditions whereby we are transformed, saved, and exalted. In this life, we make these covenants by participating in priesthood ordinances and promising to do what God asks us to do, and in return, God promises us certain blessings."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,10,"A covenant is a pledge that we should prepare for, clearly understand, and absolutely honor.Making a covenant with God is different than casually making a promise. First, priesthood authority is required. Second, a feeble promise does not have the connecting strength to liftus above the pull of the natural flow. We make a covenant only when we intend to commit ourselves quite exceptionally to fulfilling it.We become covenant children of God and inheritors of His kingdom, especially when we identify ourselves completely with the covenant."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,11,"The termcovenant pathrefers to a series of covenants whereby we come to Christ and connect to Him. Through this covenant bond, we have access to His eternal power. The path begins with faith in Jesus Christ and repentance, followed by baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost.Jesus Christ showed us how to enter the path when He was baptized.According to the New Testament Gospel accounts in Mark and Luke, Heavenly Father spoke directly to Jesus at His baptism, saying, “Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.” When we embark on the covenant path through baptism, I can imagine Heavenly Father saying a similar thing to each of us: “Thou art my dear child in whom I delight. Keep going.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,12,"At baptism and when we partake of the sacrament,we witness that we are willing to take on ourselves the name of Jesus Christ.In this context, let us be mindful of the Old Testament commandment, “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.”To our modern ears, this sounds like a prohibition against irreverently using the Lord’s name. The commandment includes that, but its injunction is even more profound. The Hebrew word translated as “take” means to “lift up” or “carry,” as one would a banner that identifies oneself with an individual or group.The word translated as “vain” means “empty” or “deceptive.”The commandment to not take the Lord’s name in vain can thus mean, “You should not identify yourself as a disciple of Jesus Christ unless you intend to represent Him well.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,13,We become His disciples and represent Him well when we intentionally and incrementally take on ourselves the name of Jesus Christ through covenants. Our covenants give us power to stay on the covenant path because our relationship with Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father is changed. We are connected to Them by a covenantal bond.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,14,"The covenant path leads to the ordinances of the temple, such as the temple endowment.The endowment is God’s gift of sacred covenants that connect us more fully to Him. In the endowment, we covenant, first, to strive to keep the commandments of God; second, to repent with a broken heart and contrite spirit; third, to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. We do this by exercising faith in Him, making covenants with God as we receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation, keeping those covenants throughout our lives, and striving to live the two great commandments to love God and neighbor. We covenant, fourth, to keep the law of chastity and, fifth, to dedicate ourselves and everything the Lord blesses us with to build up His Church."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,15,"By making and keeping temple covenants, we learn more about the Lord’s purposes and receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost.We receive direction for our lives. We mature in our discipleship so that we do not remain perpetual, unknowing children.Rather, we live with an eternal perspective and are more motivated to serve God and others. We receive increased capacity to fulfill our purposes in mortality. We are protected from evil,and we gain greater power to resist temptation and to repent when we stumble.When we falter, the memory of our covenants with God helps us return to the path. By connecting to God’s power, we become our ownpororoca, able to go against the flow of the world, throughout our lives and into the eternities. Ultimately, our destinies are changed because the covenant path leads to exaltation and eternal life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,16,"Keeping covenants made in baptismal fonts and in temples also provides us with strength to withstand mortality’s trials and heartaches.The doctrine associated with these covenants eases our way and provides hope, comfort, and peace."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,17,My grandparents Lena Sofia and Matts Leander Renlund received God’s power through their baptismal covenant when they joined the Church in 1912 in Finland. They were happy to be part of the first branch of the Church in Finland.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,18,"Leander died from tuberculosis five years later when Lena was pregnant with their tenth child. That child, my father, was born two months after Leander’s death. Lena eventually buried not just her husband but also seven of her ten children. As an impoverished widow, she struggled. For 20 years she did not get a good night’s rest. During the day, she scrambled to provide food for her family. At night, she took care of dying family members. It is hard to imagine how she coped."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,19,"Lena persevered because she knew that her deceased husband and children could be hers through the eternities. The doctrine of temple blessings, including that of eternal families, brought her peace because she trusted in the sealing power. While in mortality, she neither received her endowment nor was she sealed to Leander, but Leander remained a vital influence in her life and part of her great hope for the future."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,20,"In 1938, Lena submitted records so that temple ordinances could be performed for her deceased family members, some of the earliest submitted from Finland. After she died, temple ordinances were performed by others for her, Leander, and her deceased children. By proxy, she was endowed, Lena and Leander were sealed to each other, and their deceased children and my father were sealed to them. Like others, Lena “died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, … [was] persuaded of them, and embraced them.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,21,"Lena lived as though she had already made these covenants in her life. She knew that her baptismal and sacramental covenants connected her to the Savior. She “let the sweet longing for [the Redeemer’s] holy place bring hope to [her] desolate heart.”Lena considered it one of God’s great mercies that she learned about eternal families before experiencing the tragedies in her life. Through covenant, she received the power of God to endure and rise above the depressive pull of her challenges and hardships."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,22,"As you walk the covenant path, from baptism to the temple and throughout life, I promise you power to go against the natural worldly flow—power to learn, power to repent and be sanctified, and power to find hope, comfort, and even joy as you face life’s challenges. I promise you and your family protection against the influence of the adversary, especially when you make the temple a major focus in your life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/23renlund,Elder Dale G. Renlund,23,"As you come to Christ and are connected to Him and our Heavenly Father by covenant, something seemingly unnatural happens. You are transformed and become perfected in Jesus Christ.You become a covenant child of God and an inheritor in His kingdom.I can imagine Him saying to you, “Thou art my dear child in whom I delight. Welcome home.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Scott taught, “The Lord sees weaknesses differently than He [sees] rebellion … [because] when the Lord speaks of weaknesses, it is always with mercy” (“Personal Strength through the Atonement of Jesus Christ,”EnsignorLiahona, Nov. 2013, 83). Thus, we should not doubt the Savior’s ability to help us with our weaknesses. However, consciously breaking a covenant with the callous plan to repent afterwards—in other words, preplanned sin and repentance—is repugnant to the Lord (seeHebrews 6:4–6)."

Mark records, “And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Mark 1:11). William Tyndale’s translation is even more vivid and intimate than the King James Version. In his translation, the voice of Heavenly Father says, “Thou arte my dear Son in whom I delyghte” (in Brian Moynahan,God’s Bestseller: William Tyndale, Thomas More, and the Writing of the English Bible—A Story of Martyrdom and Betrayal[2002], 58). Only Matthew reports that the voice was more generally directed, saying, “And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17). The Gospel of John reports only of the baptism by John the Baptist: “And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God” (John 1:34)."

Oaks explained the importance of the term “willing” as we renew our baptismal covenant with the sacrament: “It is significant that when we partake of the sacrament we do not witness that wetake upon usthe name of Jesus Christ. We witness that we arewillingto do so. [SeeDoctrine and Covenants 20:77.] The fact that we only witness to our willingness suggests that something else must happen before we actually take that sacred name upon us in the most important sense” (“Taking upon Us the Name of Jesus Christ,”Ensign, May 1985, 81).

As we stand in the waters of baptism, we look to the temple. As we partake of the sacrament, we look to the temple. We pledge to always remember the Savior and to keep His commandments as preparation to participate in the sacred ordinances of the temple and receive the highest blessings available through the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, in the ordinances of the holy temple we more completely and fully take upon us the name of Jesus Christ” (“Honorably Hold a Name and Standing,”EnsignorLiahona, May 2009, 98).

He invited the people to come forth to put their hands into His side and to feel the prints of the nails in His hands and in His feet.

After enjoying a wonderful day playing as a family, we packed everyone into the car and headed home. While driving, I momentarily fell asleep and caused a head-on car accident. After some moments of recovery, I looked around the vehicle. My wife, Maxine, had a badly broken leg and was struggling to breathe. She had a broken sternum. Our three daughters were in shock but thankfully appeared to be OK. I had some minor injuries. But our five-month-old son was unresponsive."

Maxine couldn’t be moved. Carefully I picked Jarom up; then, while lying on the ground on my back, I gently placed him on my chest and gave him a priesthood blessing. By the time the ambulance arrived about 40 minutes later, Jarom was conscious."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,12,"Our beloved President Russell M. Nelson has repeatedly taught about the importance of a patriarchal blessing,that it gives each recipient “a declaration of lineage back to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob”and that each blessing “is personal scripture to you.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,13,"My patriarchal blessing was critically important to me when I was young for numerous reasons. First, through the power of the Holy Ghost, my patriarchal blessing helped me understand my true eternal identity—who I really was and who I could become. It helped me know, as President Nelson has taught, that I was “asonof God,” “a[child]of the covenant,” and “adiscipleof Jesus Christ.”I knew that I was known and loved by my Heavenly Father and my Savior and that They were personally involved in my life. This helped me desire to draw closer to Them and increase my faith and trust in Them."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,14,"A dear friend who joined the Church as a young adult shared:“When the patriarch placed his hands on my head and spoke my name, everything changed, … not just then but for the rest of my life. I immediately sensed that—through the power by which he spoke—I was known intimately and deeply. The words he spoke penetrated my entire being. I knew that Heavenly Father knew me, inside and out.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,15,Knowing who I really was helped me understand and desire to do what God expected of me.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,16,This led me to study the covenants I had made and the promised blessings in God’s covenant with Abraham.It gave me an eternal perspective that inspired me to more fully keep my covenants.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,17,"I studied my patriarchal blessing frequently and, as a youth, often daily, which helped me feel the comforting, guiding influence of the Holy Ghost, who helped reduce my anxiety as I followed His promptings. This increased my desire to actively invite light, truth, and the Holy Ghost by studying my scriptures and praying daily and trying to more diligently study and follow the teachings of God’s prophet and apostles. My patriarchal blessing also helped me desire to be more submissive to the will of my Heavenly Father, and that focus helped me experience great joy, despite my personal circumstances."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,18,"I received spiritual strength each time I studied my patriarchal blessing. When my parents finally did divorce, my patriarchal blessing, as President Thomas S. Monson taught, had for me become “a precious and priceless personal treasure,” even “a personal Liahona.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,19,"Now, please don’t misunderstand. I wasn’t perfect. I made all sorts of mistakes. My eternal companion would confirm that I still do. But my patriarchal blessing helped me and continues to help me desire to do better and be better.Frequently studying my patriarchal blessing increased my desire to withstand temptation. It helped me have the desire and courage to repent, and repentance increasingly became a joyful process."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,20,It was vital for me to receive my patriarchal blessing while I was young and while my testimony was still growing. And I am forever grateful that my parents and bishop understood that my desire indicated I was ready.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,21,"When I was 12, the world was far less confusing and distracting than the world today. President Nelson has described today as “a most complicated time in the history of the world,” a world that is “sin-saturated” and “self-centered.”Fortunately our youth today are much more mature than I was at 12, and they too have critically important decisions to make while they are young! They also need to know who they really are and that God loves them and is perfectly aware of them!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,22,"Not everyone will desire their patriarchal blessing when I did. But I pray that members who have not yet received their patriarchal blessing will prayerfully seek to know when they are ready. I promise that if you prepare spiritually, your experience, like mine, will be sacred to you. I also pray that those who have already received their patriarchal blessing will study it and treasure it. Cherishing my patriarchal blessing while I was young blessed me with courage when I was discouraged, comfort when I was fearful, peace when I felt anxious, hope when I felt hopeless, and joy when I needed it most. My patriarchal blessing helped increase my faith and trust in my Heavenly Father and my Savior. It also increased my love for Them—and it still does."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/25bennett,Elder Randall K. Bennett,23,"I testify that patriarchal blessings do provide inspired direction from Heavenly Father. I bear my witness of the living reality of our Father in Heaven and His Son—our Savior, Jesus Christ—who know us, love us, and desire to bless us. I also know with certainty that President Russell M. Nelson is God’s prophet on the earth today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,4,"Throughout His mortal ministry, the Savior showed great compassion for all of God’s children—especially for those who were suffering or had fallen away. When criticized by the Pharisees for associating with and eating among sinners, Jesus responded by teaching three familiar parables.In each of these parables, He emphasized the importance of seeking out those who had strayed and the joy that is felt when they return. For example, in the parable of the lost sheep, He said, “[Great] joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,5,"My desire today is to strengthen the connection between joy and repentance—more specifically, the joy that comes when we repent and the feelings of joy we experience as we invite others to come unto Christ and receive His atoning sacrifice in their lives."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,6,"In the scriptures, the wordjoytypically means much more than passing moments of contentment or even feelings of happiness. Joy in this context is a godly attribute, found in its fulness when we return to dwell in the presence of God.It is more profound, elevating, enduring, and life-changing than any pleasure or comfort this world can offer."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,7,"We were created to have joy. It is our intended destiny as children of a loving Heavenly Father. He wants to share His joy with us. The prophet Lehi taught that God’s plan for each of us is that we “might have joy.”Because we live in a fallen world, enduring joy or everlasting joy often seems beyond our reach. Yet in the very next verse, Lehi continues by explaining that “the Messiah [came to] … redeem [us] from the fall.”Redemption, by and through the Savior Jesus Christ, makes joy possible."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,8,"The gospel message is a message of hope, of “good tidings of great joy,”and the means whereby all can experience peace and occasions of joy inthis life and receive a fulness of joy in the life to come."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,9,"The joy we speak of is a gift for the faithful, yet it comes with a price. Joy is not cheap or casually given. Rather, it is bought “with the precious blood of [Jesus] Christ.”If we really understood the value of true, godly joy, we would not hesitate to sacrifice any worldly possession or make any necessary life changes to receive it."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,10,"A powerful but humble king in the Book of Mormon understood this. “What shall I do,” he asked, “that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy … ? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,11,"In response to the king’s question, the missionary Aaron said, “If thou desirest this thing, … bow down before God … [and] repent of all thy sins.”Repentance is the pathway to joybecause it is the pathway that leads to the Savior Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,12,"For some, to think of repentance as the pathway to joy might seem contradictory. Repentance, at times, can be painful and difficult. It requires admitting that some of our thoughts and actions—even some of our beliefs—have been wrong. Repentance also requires change, which, at times, can be uncomfortable. But joy and comfort are not the same thing. Sin—including the sin of complacency—limits our joy."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,13,"As stated by the psalmist, “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”As we repent of our sins, we must focus on the great joy that follows. The nights may seem long, but the morning does come, and oh, how exquisite is the peace and resplendent joy we feel as the Savior’s Atonement frees us from sin and suffering."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,14,"Consider the experience of Alma in the Book of Mormon. He was “racked with eternal torment,” and his soul was “harrowed up” because of his sins. But once he turned to the Savior for mercy, he “could remember [his] pains no more.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,15,"“And oh, what joy,” he declared, “and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, … there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,16,"This is the kind of joy available to those who come unto Jesus Christ through repentance.As President Russell M. Nelson has taught:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,17,“Repentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. …
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,18,"“When we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves. We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy—the joy of redemption in Him. When we choose to repent, we choose to become more like Jesus Christ!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,19,"Repentance brings joy because it prepares our hearts to receive the influence of the Holy Ghost. To be filled with the Holy Ghost means to be filled with joy. And to be filled with joy means to be filled with the Holy Ghost.Our joy increases as we work daily to bring the Spirit into our lives. As taught by the prophet Mormon, “Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in [their] faith [in] Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation.”The Lord promises all who work to follow Him, “I will impart unto you … my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,20,"After we have felt the joy that comes from sincere repentance, we quite naturally want to share that joy with others. As we do, our joy multiplies. That’s exactly what happened to Alma."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,21,"“This is my glory,” he said, “that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,22,"“And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, … yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended [to] me.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,23,"Helping others repent is a natural expression of our gratitude toward the Savior, and it is a source of great joy. The Lord has promised:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,24,"“If it so be that you should … bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,25,"“And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought unto me … , how great will be your joy if you should bring many souls unto me!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,26,"I find it helpful to try to imagine the joy the Savior must feel each time we receive the blessings of His atoning sacrifice in our lives.As cited by President Nelson,the Apostle Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews shared this tender insight: “Lay aside every … sin which doth so easily beset us, … looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith;who for the joy that was set before himendured the cross … and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”We speak often of the pain and suffering of Gethsemane and Calvary, but seldom do we speak of the great joy the Savior must have anticipated as He offered His life for us. Clearly, His pain and His suffering were for us, that we might experience the joy of returning with Him to the presence of God."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,27,"After teaching the people in ancient America, the Savior expressed His great love for them by saying:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,28,"“Now, behold, my joy is great, even unto fulness, because of you … ; yea, and even the Father rejoiceth, and also all the holy angels. …"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,29,"“… In [you] I have [a] fulness of joy.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/26christensen,Elder Craig C. Christensen,30,"Brothers and sisters, I conclude by sharing my personal witness, which I consider a sacred gift. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. I know that He loves each of us. His singular focus, His “work and [His] glory,”is to help us receive a fulness of joy in Him. I am a personal witness that repenting daily and coming unto Jesus Christ is the way to experience joy—joy beyond our imagination.That is why we are here on earth. That is why God prepared His great plan of happiness for us. Jesus Christ truly is “the way, the truth, and the life”and the only “name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.”I so testify in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,9,But the importance of the doctrine of Christ is not just for missionaries! And it is much more profound than a mere summary repetition of its fivekey elements. It encompasses the law of the gospel. It is the great plan for eternal life.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,10,"Brothers and sisters, if we are to accept President Nelson’s invitation to have the doctrine of Christ rooted in the marrow ofourbones, we must deepen our conversion to the Lord by study, prayer, faithful living, and continual repentance. We must invite the Holy Ghost to engrave the doctrine of Christ in the “fleshy tables of [our] heart[s]”as deeply and as permanently as it was engraved by Nephi upon the plates of gold."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,11,"Last October, President Nelson asked, “What does it mean to overcome the world?” Among other things, he said, “It meanstrustingthe doctrine of Christ more than the philosophies of men.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,12,"The wordtrustis defined as an “assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something.”That someone is Jesus Christ, and that something is His doctrine."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,13,So how would intentionallytrustingthe doctrine of Christ change the way we live our lives?
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,14,"If wetrustthe doctrine of Christ, we will trust Christ enough to live by His every word.We will make a lifelong study of Jesus Christ,His ministry, His teachings, and His infinite Atonement, including His glorious Resurrection. We will study His promises and the conditions upon which those promises are given.As we study, we will be filled with greater love for the Lord."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,15,"If wetrustthe doctrine of Christ, we will approach our Heavenly Father every day in humble, secret prayer, where we can express gratitude for the gift of His Son and for all of our blessings.We can pray for the revelatory companionship of the Holy Ghost,pray to align our will with His,pray to reflect upon our covenants and renew our commitment to keep them.We can pray to sustain and express love for our prophets, seers, and revelators;pray for the cleansing power of forgiveness;and pray for the strength to resist temptation.I invite you to make prayer a priority in your life, seeking each day to improve your communication with God."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,16,"If wetrustthe doctrine of Christ, we will set aside the shiny things of the world so that we can focus on the Redeemer of the world.We will limit or eliminate time spent on social media; digital games; wasteful, excessive, or inappropriate entertainment; the allure of this world’s treasures and vanities; and any other activities that give place to the false traditions and misguided philosophies of men. It is only in Christ we find truth and lasting fulfillment."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,17,"Sincere repentancewill become a joyfulpart of our lives—both to be forgiven for sin and to be changed in the image of Christ.Repentance with faith in Christ gives us access to the Atonement of Christ. President Dallin H. Oaks has taught that when the Savior forgives, He “does more than cleanse [us] from sin. He also gives [us] new strength.”Each one of us needs this strength to keep the commandments of God and to fulfill the eternal purpose of our lives."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,18,"In Jesus and in His doctrine, we find strength. He said, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, thatthis is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth uponthisbuildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,19,"We see this promise fulfilled in the lives of faithful people. It was a little over a year ago that I was privileged to meet Travis and Kacie. They were married civilly in 2007. At the time, Travis was not a member of the Church. Kacie, though raised in an active Latter-day Saint home, had drifted from her faith in her teens and had strayed from her foundation."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,20,"In 2018, Travis met the missionaries, and he was baptized in 2019. Travis became a missionary to Kacie, who also experienced a life-changing conversion. They were sealed in the temple in September 2020. About two years after his baptism, Travis was called to serve in the bishopric."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,21,"Travis has a rare disease that continuously forms clusters of tumors in his internal organs. He has undergone many surgeries to remove the recurring tumors, but the disease is incurable. Several years ago, Travis was given fewer than 10 years to live."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,22,"Kacie hasretinitis pigmentosa, a rare genetic disease that causes irreversible narrowing of the field of vision until complete blindness sets in."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,23,"Kacie spoke to me of her future. She anticipated the time, not far distant, when she would be widowed, blind, without financial support, and left alone to raise four growing children. I asked Kacie how she could handle such a bleak future. She smiled peacefully and said, “I have never been happier or more hopeful in my life. We hold to the promises we received in the temple.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,24,"Travis is now the bishop. Two months ago he had another major surgery. But he is optimistic and peaceful. Kacie’s vision has worsened. She now has a guide dog and is unable to drive. But she is content, raising her children and serving as a counselor in the Young Women presidency."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,25,"Travis and Kacie are building their house on the rock. Travis and Kacie trust the doctrine of Christ and the promise that God “shall consecrate [their] afflictions for [their] gain.”In God’s perfect plan, suffering with faith in Christ is linked to our becoming perfected in Christ.Like the wise man in the parable who built his house upon a rock,when the rain descends and the floods come and the winds blow and beat upon the house Travis and Kacie are building, it will fall not, for it will be founded upon a rock."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,26,Jesus did not speak of thepossibilityof rain and flood and wind in our lives; He spoke of thecertaintythat storms will arise. The variable in this parable is not whether storms will come but how we have responded to His loving invitation to both hear and do what He has taught.There is no other way to survive.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,27,"When we have built our houses on the foundation of a covenantal relationship with Christ, we aretrustingthe doctrine of Christ, and as we come unto Him, we have His promise of eternal life. People who trust the doctrine of Christ press forward with steadfastness in Christ and endure to the end. There is no other way to be saved in the kingdom of heaven."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/27schmutz,Elder Evan A. Schmutz,28,"I bear my personal witness of the living, resurrected reality of Jesus Christ. I testify that God our Father so loved the world He sent His Son to redeem us from sinand heal us from sorrow.I testify that He has called a prophet of God in our time, even President Russell M. Nelson, through whom He speaks and guides us."

Since the early days of the Restoration, faithful Saints have made many sacrifices to receive temple ordinances and covenants. Following their great example, in 1975, after many economic sacrifices to travel from Mexico City, my dear wife, Evelia, and I, being accompanied by our dear parents, were sealed as an eternal husband and wife in the Mesa Arizona Temple. That day, as we were united by the authority of the priesthood in the house of the Lord, we truly experienced a glimpse of heaven."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/28de-hoyos,Elder Benjamín De Hoyos,5,"That experience has permitted me to appreciate much better how, after three years of hard work and great sacrifice, the Saints in Kirtland, Ohio, finally completed their beautiful temple in the spring of 1836—the first in this dispensation. In March of that same year, over a thousand people gathered in the temple and at its entrances for the dedicatory service. The Prophet Joseph Smith arose to offer the dedicatory prayer, which he had received by revelation (seeDoctrine and Covenants 109). In it he described many of the extraordinary blessings that are bestowed upon those who worthily enter the temples of the Lord. Then the choir sang the hymn “The Spirit of God,” and the congregation stood and gave the Hosanna Shout “with such [force that it] seemed … to raise the roof from the building” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith[2007], 307)."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/28de-hoyos,Elder Benjamín De Hoyos,6,"One week later the Prophet described the appearance of the Lord in the temple, who said:"

After the dedication of the Salt Lake Temple in 1893, President Wilford Woodruff encouraged the members of the Church to find the records of their ancestors and to record their genealogy by going as far back as possible in order to bring the names into the temple and perform the ordinances of salvation and exaltation (seeTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff[2004], 174)."

That is a central focus of the plan of our Heavenly Father: uniting family for this life and for eternity."

These FamilySearchcenters have been designed so that almost everyone, with little help, can find their ancestors’ information and organize it properly so that they can take it to the house of the Lord. Please contact the family history consultants in your ward or branch, who will guide you every step of the way."

The Spirit will flood our hearts, awaken our faculties to do it, and guide us as we search for the names of our ancestors. But let us remember that family history is more than just looking for names, dates, and places. It is uniting families and feeling the joy that comes from extending to them the ordinances of the gospel."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/28de-hoyos,Elder Benjamín De Hoyos,22,"I love the inspired teaching of our beloved prophet, President Russell M.

Everything taught in the temple, through instruction and through the Spirit, increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. His essential ordinances bind us to Him through sacred priesthood covenants. Then, as we keep our covenants, He endows us withHishealing, strengthening power” (“The Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation,”Liahona, Nov. 2021, 93–94)."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,11,"But as this girl seemed to understand, there’s something equally sacred—something irreplaceable—about a parent nurturing a child. It reflects the pattern of heaven.Our Father in Heaven, our Divine Parent, surely rejoices when His children are taught and nurtured by their parents on earth."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,12,"Parents, thank you for everything you’re doing to raise your children. And children, thank you for everything you’re doing to raise your parents, because as every parent knows, we often learn as much from our children about faith, hope, and charity as they learn from us!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,13,"Have you ever thought about the tremendous risk our Father in Heaven takes each time He sends a child to earth? These are His spirit sons and daughters. They have limitless potential. They are destined to become glorious beings of goodness, grace, and truth. And yet they come to earth completely helpless, barely able to do anything besides cry for help. The memory of their time in God’s presence is veiled over, along with the knowledge of who they really are and who they can become. They form their understanding of life, love, God, and His plan based on what they observe from the people around them—especially their parents, who, honestly, are still tryingto figure things out for themselves."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,14,"God has given parents the “sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, and to teach them to … observe the commandments of God.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,15,That’s enough to keep even the best parents awake at night.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,16,"My message to all parents is this:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,17,The Lord loves you.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,18,He is with you.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,19,He stands beside you.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,20,He is your strength in guiding your children to make righteous choices.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,21,"Accept this privilege and responsibility courageously and joyfully. Don’t delegate this source of heavenly blessings to anyone else. Within the framework of gospel values and principles, you are the ones to guide your child in the details of daily decisions. Help your children build faith in Jesus Christ, love His gospel and His Church, and prepare for a lifetime of righteous choices. In fact, that is God’s plan for parents."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,22,"Satan will oppose you, distract you, try to discourage you."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,23,"But every child has received the Light of Christ as a direct line to heaven. And the Savior will help you, guide you, and encourage you. Seek His help. Inquire of the Lord!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,24,"Just as Jesus Christ is the strength of youth, Jesus Christ is also the strength of parents."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,25,"Sometimes we might wonder if someone else might be better qualified to guide and teach our children. But no matter how inadequate you may feel, you have something that uniquely qualifies you: your love for your child."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,26,A parent’s love for a child is one of the strongest forces in the universe. It’s one of the few things on this earth that can truly be eternal.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,27,"Now, perhaps you feel that your relationship with your child is less than ideal. That’s where the Savior’s power comes in. He heals the sick, and He can heal relationships. He multiplies bread and fish, and He can multiply the love and the joy in your home."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,28,"Your love for your children creates a rich environment for teaching truth and building faith. Make your home a house of prayer, learning, and faith; a house of joyful experiences; a place of belonging; a house of God.And “pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that [you] may be filled with [His] love, which he [bestows] upon … followers of his Son, Jesus Christ.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,29,"Another strength you have, as a parent, is the opportunity for daily,ongoing influence. Peers, teachers, and media influencers come and go. But you can be the most constant, steady influence in your child’s life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,30,"Your efforts may seem small compared to the loud voices your children hear in the world. At times it may feel that you’re not accomplishing much. But remember that “by small means the Lord can bring about great things.”One home evening, one gospel conversation, or one good example may not change your child’s life in a moment, any more than one drop of rain causes a plant immediately to grow. But the consistency of small and simple things, day after day, nourishes your children much better than an occasional flood."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,31,"That is the Lord’s way. He speaks to you and your child with a still, small voice, not a voice of thunder.He healed Naaman not through “some great thing” but through the simple, repeated act of washing.The children of Israel enjoyed the feast of quail in the wilderness, but what kept them alive was the small and simple miracle of manna—their daily bread."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,32,"Brothers and sisters, daily bread is best prepared and served at home. Faith and testimony are best fostered in normal and natural ways, one bite at a time, in small and simple moments, in the constant flow of daily living."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,33,Every moment is a teaching moment. Every word and action can be a guide for making choices.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,34,"You may not see the immediate effects of your efforts. But don’t give up. “All things must come to pass in their time,” the Lord said. “Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for [you] are laying the foundation of a great work.”What work could be greater than helping God’s precious children learn who they really are and build their faith in Jesus Christ, His gospel, and His Church? Jesus Christ will bless and magnify your consistent efforts."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,35,Another powerful way the Lord supports parents is through the gift of personal revelation. God is eager to pour out His Spirit to guide parents.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,36,"As you are prayerful and sensitive to the Spirit, He will warn you of hidden dangers.He will reveal your children’s gifts, their strengths, and their unspoken concerns.God will help you see your children as He sees them—beyond their outward appearance and into their hearts."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,37,"With God’s help, you can learn to know your children in a pure and heavenly way. I invite you to accept God’s offer to guide your family by personal revelation. Seek His guidance in your prayers."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,38,Perhaps the most important help Jesus Christ offers to parents is the “mighty change” of heart.It’s a miracle every one of us needs.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,39,"For a moment, imagine this situation: You’re at church, listening to a talk about families. The speaker describes a perfect home and an even more perfect family. Husband and wife never quarrel. Children stop reading their scriptures only when it’s time to do homework. And the music of “Love One Another”is playing in the background. Before the speaker gets to the part about everyone cheerfully joining to clean the bathroom, you’re already thinking, “My family is hopeless.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,40,"Dear brothers and sisters, relax! Everyone in the congregation is thinking the same thing! The fact is, all parents worry about not being good enough."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,41,"Fortunately, there is a divine source of help for parents: It is Jesus Christ. He is the source of our mighty change of heart."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,42,"As you open your heart to the Savior and His teachings, He will show you your weakness. If you trust Jesus Christ with a humble heart, He will make weak things become strong.He is the God of miracles."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,43,"Does that mean you and your family will be picture-perfect? No. But you will get better. Through the Savior’s grace, little by little, you’ll develop more of the attributes parents need:love for God and His children, patience, selflessness, faith in Christ, and courage to make righteous choices."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,44,"Our effort to build faith in Jesus Christ is home centered, focused on the individual. And it is Church supported. Besides providing the sacred scriptures and the words of prophets, the Savior’s Church offers many resources to help parents and children make righteous choices:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,45,"For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choicesdoes not give you a list of dos or don’ts. It teaches eternal truths to help make choices centered on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Read it with your children. Let them talk about it. Help them to have these eternal and divine truths guide their choices."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,46,FSY conferences are another wonderful resource. I hope every youth will attend. I invite young single adults to join these conferences as mentors and counselors. I invite parents to build on the spiritual momentum their youth bring home from FSY conferences.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,47,"Children and youth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have teachers, advisers, and mentors. Often you enter a young person’s life at a crucial moment to build and support faith and testimony. Some of you are single adults. Some never had children of your own. Your joyful service to God’s children is sacred in God’s eyes."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,48,"My dear friends, my dear brothers and sisters, building faith in a child is somewhat like helping a flower grow. You cannot tug on the stem to make it taller. You cannot pry open the bud to get it to blossom sooner. And you cannotneglectthe flower and expect it to grow or flourish spontaneously."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,49,"What you can and must do for the rising generation is provide rich, nourishing soil with access to flowing heavenly water. Remove weeds and anything that would block heavenly sunlight. Create the best possible conditions for growth. Patiently allow the rising generation to make inspired choices, and let God work His miracle. The result will be more beautiful and more stunning and more joyful than anything you could accomplish just by yourself."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,50,"In Heavenly Father’s plan, families’ relationships are meant to be eternal. This is why, as a parent, you never give up, even if you are not proud of how things went in the past."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,51,"With Jesus Christ, the Master Healer and Savior, there can always be a new beginning; He always gives hope."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,52,Jesus Christ is the strength of families.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,53,Jesus Christ is the strength of youth.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,54,Jesus Christ is the strength of parents.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,56,Notes
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,57,"“Innate in almost every parent is the desire to teach his or her children moral virtues. This is part of the miracle of Heavenly Father’s plan. He wants His children to come to earth, following the eternal pattern of families that exists in heaven. Families are the basic organizational unit of the eternal realms, and so He intends for them also to be the basic unit on earth. Though earthly families are far from perfect, they give God’s children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heaven—parental love. Families are also the best way to preserve and pass on moral virtues and true principles that are most likely to lead us back to God’s presence” (Henry B. Eyring, “Gathering the Family of God,”EnsignorLiahona, May 2017, 20)."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/29uchtdorf,Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf,58,"Of course, we know that God’s will is not always accomplished “in earth, as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10). Mortal parenthood certainly pales in comparison to God’s ideal. He surely sees that. He must weep over all the sorrows and heartache in family relationships. And yet He has not given up on the family. And He will not, because God has a glorious plan for the eternal destiny of His children. And at the center of that plan is the family."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,4,"The last time that I spoke in general conference, my son-in-law Ryan showed me a tweet that said, “Really? The guy’s name is Bragg”—meaning “to boast”—“and he doesn’t talk about humility? What a waste!” Sadly, the disappointment continues."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,5,"My wonderful father was an All-America basketball player for UCLA under legendary Coach John Wooden. They remained close throughout my father’s life, and occasionally Coach and Mrs. Wooden would come to our home for dinner. He was always happy to talk to me about basketball or anything else on my mind. Once I asked him what advice he had for me as I entered my senior year of high school. Always the teacher, he said, “Your father told me that you have joined the Church of Jesus Christ, so I know that you have faith in the Lord. With that faith be sure to have poise in every situation. Be a good man in a storm.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,6,"Over the years, that conversation stuck with me. That counsel to be calm, cool, and collected in all situations, particularly in times of adversity and pressure, resonated with me. I could see how Coach Wooden’s teams played with poise and the great success that they experienced winning 10 national championships."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,7,"But poise is not spoken about much these days and practiced even less in turbulent and divisive times. It is often referenced in sports—a player with poise is unflappable in a close game, or a team unravels due to a lack of poise. But this wonderful quality goes way beyond sports. Poise has a much broader application to life and can bless parents, leaders, missionaries, teachers, students, and everyone else facing the storms of life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,8,"Spiritual poise blesses us to stay calm and focused on what matters most, especially when we are under pressure. President Hugh B. Brown taught, “Faith in God and in the ultimate triumph of right contributes to mental and spiritual poise in the face of difficulties.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,9,"President Russell M. Nelson is a wonderful example of spiritual poise. One time, while then-Dr. Nelson was performing a quadruple coronary artery bypass, the patient’s blood pressure dropped suddenly. Dr. Nelson calmly assessed the situation and identified that a clamp was accidentally removed by one of the team members. It was replaced immediately, and Dr. Nelson comforted the team member, saying, “I still love you,” and then added jokingly, “Sometimes I love you more than other times!” He showed how an emergency should be handled—with poise, focused only on what matters most—addressing the emergency. President Nelson said: “It’s a matter of extreme self-discipline. Your natural reaction is, ‘Take me out, coach! I want to go home.’ But of course you can’t. A life is totally dependent on the whole surgical team. So you’ve got to stay just as calm and relaxed and sharp as you ever were.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,10,"Of course, the Savior is the ultimate example of poise."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,11,"In the Garden of Gethsemane, in unimaginable agony, as “he sweat as it were great drops of blood,”He exemplified divine poise with the simple yet majestic statement “Not my will, but thine, be done.”Under the immense pressure to enable the salvation of all humankind, Jesus demonstrated three important conditions that help us understand His great poise. First, He knew who He was andwas true to His divine mission. Next, He knew that there was a great plan of happiness. And finally, He knew that through His infinite Atonement, all who faithfully yoke themselves to Him by making and keeping sacred covenants received through priesthood ordinances will be saved, as was so beautifully taught by Elder Dale G. Renlund today."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,12,"To contrast the difference between losing and maintaining poise, think about what happened as Christ and His Apostles left the Garden of Gethsemane. When confronted by soldiers seeking to arrest Jesus, Peter’s reaction was to lose his poise and lash out violently by cutting off the ear of the high priest’s servant, Malchus. Jesus Christ’s reaction, on the other hand, was to keep His poise and to bring calm to a tense situation by healing Malchus."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,13,"And for those of us who struggle with maintaining our poise and perhaps have grown discouraged, consider the rest of Peter’s story. A short time after this incident and the heartbreak of denying his association with Christ,Peter stood before the very same religious leaders who condemned the Savior, and with great poise under intense questioning, he bore eloquent testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,14,"Let’s consider elements of Christlike poise. To begin, knowing who we are and being true to our divine identity brings calm. Christlike poise requires that we avoid comparing ourselves to others or pretending to be someone we’re not.Joseph Smith taught, “If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves.”It is just not possible to have divine poise without knowing that we are divine sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,15,"In his talk “Choices for Eternity,” President Nelson taught these eternal truths about who we are: we are children of God, we are children of the covenant, and we are disciples of Christ. He then promised, “As you embrace these truths, our Heavenly Father will help you reach your ultimate goal of living eternally in His holy presence.”We truly are divine spiritual beings having a mortal experience. Knowing who we are and being true to that divine identity are foundational to the development of Christlike poise."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,16,"Next, remembering that there is a grand plan engenders courage and poise in challenging conditions. Nephi could “go and do”as the Lord commanded “not knowing beforehand”the things that he was to dobecause he knew that he would be led by the Spirit, in fulfillment of the eternal plan of a loving Heavenly Father. Poise comes when we see things from an eternal perspective. The Lord has counseled His disciples to “lift up your eyes”and to “let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.”By framing challenging times within an eternal plan, pressure becomes a privilege to love, serve, teach, and bless. An eternal view enables Christlike poise."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,17,"And finally, the enabling power of Christ, made possible by His atoning sacrifice, gives us the strength to endure and prevail. Because of Jesus Christ we can covenant with God and be strengthened in keeping that covenant. We can be bound to the Savior in joy and calm, regardless of our temporal circumstances.Alma chapter 7teaches beautifully about Christ’s enabling power. In addition to redeeming us from sin, the Savior can strengthen us in our weaknesses, fears, and challenges in this life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,18,"As we focus on Christ, we can hush our fears, as Alma’s people did in Helam.As a threatening army gathered, those faithful disciples of Christ demonstrated poise. Elder David A. Bednar has taught: “Alma counseled the believers to remember the Lord and the deliverance only He could bestow (see 2 Nephi 2:8). And knowledge of the Savior’s protecting watchcare enabled the people to hush their own fears.”This exemplifies poise."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,19,"Noah taught us much about patience in a storm, but the Savior was the greatest teacher on how to survive a storm. He is the great man in a storm. After a long day of teaching with His Apostles, the Savior needed some rest and suggested that they cross by boat to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. As the Savior rested, a severe storm arose. As the wind and waves threatened to sinkthe boat, the Apostles began to fear for their lives. And remember, several of those Apostles were fishermen who were very well acquainted with the storms on that sea! Yet, worried,they woke the Lord and asked, “[Lord], carest thou not that we perish?” Then, with exemplary poise, the Savior “arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was … great calm.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,20,"And then a great lesson in poise for His Apostles. He asked, “Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?”He was reminding them that He was the Savior of the world and that He was sent by the Father to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of God’s children. Surely the Son of God would not perish on a boat. He exemplified divine poise because He knew of His divinity and He knew that there was a plan of salvation and exaltation and how essential His Atonement would be to the eternal success of that plan."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,21,"It is through Christ and His Atonement that all good things come into our lives. As we remember who we are, knowing that there is a divine plan of mercy and drawing courage in the strength of the Lord, we can do all things. We will find calm. We will be good women and men in any storm."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/31bragg,Elder Mark A. Bragg,22,"May we seek the blessings of Christlike poise, not only to help ourselves in challenging times but to bless others and help them through the storms in their lives. On this eve of Palm Sunday, I joyfully testify of Jesus Christ. He is risen. I testify of the peace, calm, and heavenly poise that only He brings to our lives and do so in His holy name, Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,4,"My father used to tell me, “Don’t focus so intensely on your problems that you can’t see the solution.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,5,"I testify that the Lord Jesus Christ is the solution to even our most difficult problems. Specifically, He has overcome four problems that every one of us faces and that not one of us can solve on our own:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,6,"The first problem is physical death. We can try to delay it or ignore it, but we can’t overcome it on our own. Jesus Christ, however, overcame death for us, and as a consequence, we will all be resurrected one day."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,7,"The second problem includes the tribulations, difficult experiences, sadness, pain, and unfairness of this world. Jesus Christ overcame all of this. For those who strive to follow Him, He will one day “wipe away all tears” and make things right again.In the meantime, He can strengthen us to pass through our trials with confidence, good cheer, and peace."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,8,"The third problem is spiritual death arising from sin. Jesus Christ overcame this problem by taking upon Himself “the chastisement of our peace.”Because of His atoning sacrifice, we can be freed from the consequences of our sins if we have faith in the Savior, sincerely repent, accept the covenant the Father offers us through essential ordinances such as baptism, and endure to the end."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,9,"The fourth problem is our limited, imperfect natures. Jesus Christ has the solution to this problem too. He doesn’t just erase our errors and make us innocent again. He can work “a mighty change in … our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.”We can be perfected by the grace of Christ and one day become like Him."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,10,"Unfortunately, too often we concentrate so much on our own problems that we lose focus on the solution, our Savior, Jesus Christ. How do we avoid that mistake? I believe the answer lies in the covenants we are invited to make with Him and our Father in Heaven."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,11,"Our covenants help us focus our attention, our thoughts, and our actions on Christ. As we “cleave unto the covenants [we have] made,” we can more easily identify “the things of this world” that we should “lay aside” and “the things of a better [world]” we should diligently seek."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,12,"That’s what the people of Ammon did in the Book of Mormon. As they learned of Jesus Christ and began to focus their lives on Him, they recognized that they should bury their weapons of war and became perfectly honest and “distinguished for their zeal towards God.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,13,"Covenant keeping leads us to seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives it away—“for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.”Thismay mean that we have to change our vocabulary, using kinder words. It could mean replacing spiritually unhealthy habits with new habits that strengthen our relationship with the Lord, such as daily prayer and scripture study, individually and with our family."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,14,President Russell M. Nelson said that “each person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples—and keeps them—has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ. …
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,15,"“The reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power—power that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,16,"Renewing our covenants during the sacrament each Sunday is a great opportunity to examine ourselvesand refocus our lives on Jesus Christ. By partaking of the sacrament, we declare that we do “always remember him.”The wordalwaysis so significant. It extends the Savior’s influence into every part of our lives. We don’t remember Him only at church or only during our morning prayers or only when we’re in trouble and we need something."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,17,"Yes, we sometimes get distracted. We forget. We lose our focus. But renewing our covenants means that wewantto always remember the Savior, that we will try to do so throughout the week, and that we will recommit and refocus on Him again at the sacrament table next week."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,18,"Clearly, focusing on Jesus Christ must be more than a Sunday, at-church activity. When President Nelson introducedCome, Follow Mein 2018, he said, “It is time for ahome-centered Church.”He said we should “transform [our] home into a sanctuary of faith” and “a center of gospel learning.” And he made four wonderful promises to us if we do."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,19,"The first promise:“YourSabbath days will truly be a delight.” It will become a day when we draw closer to our Savior. As a young woman from Peru said, “The Lord’s day is the day I get the most answers from the Lord.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,20,"The second promise:“Yourchildren will be excited to learn and to live the Savior’s teachings.” That is why “wetalk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, … that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,21,"We do this so that one day, when our son goes out to work or to hike in the mountains or to hunt beasts in the forests, as Enos did, he may remember what we taught him about Christ and about the joy of living the gospel. And who knows? Maybe this will be the day when he will finally feel the spiritual hunger that turns him to Jesus Christ so he can hear the voice of the Lord saying to him, “Thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,22,"The third promise:“The influence of the adversary inyourlife and inyourhome will decrease.” Why? Because the more we focus on Jesus Christ, the more sin loses its appeal.As our homes are filled with the Savior’s light, there is less and less room for the darkness of the adversary."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,23,"The fourth promise:“Changes in your family will be dramatic and sustaining.” Why? Because the change that Jesus Christ brings is “a mighty change.”He changes our very natures; we become “new creatures.”We gradually become more like the Savior, filled with His pure love for all of God’s children."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,24,"Who wouldn’t want these promises fulfilled in their lives and in their families? What do we need to do to obtain them? The answer is to transform our homes into a sanctuary of faith and a center of gospel learning. And how do we do that? By focusing on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, making Them the center of our family life, the most important influence in our home."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/32camargo,Brother Milton Camargo,25,"Could I suggest that you begin by making the words of Christ, found in the scriptures, a daily part of your life? There is no prescribed formula for perfect scripture study. It could be 5 or 10 minutes each day—or more if you can. It could be a chapter or a few verses a day. Some families prefer to study in the morning before they leave for school or work. Others prefer to read at night before bed. Some young couples have told me that they study individually on the way to work and then share insights with each other via text so their comments and discussions are recorded."

He is the solution to our problems, but we must lift our eyes and raise our sights to see Him. He has said, “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”As we focus on Him and our Father in Heaven, make and keep covenants with Them, and make Them the most important influence in our home and family, we will become the kind of people President Nelson envisioned: “A people who are able, ready, and worthy to receive the Lord when He comes again, a people who have already chosen Jesus Christ over this fallen world, a people who rejoice in their agency to live the higher, holier laws of Jesus Christ.”In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,8,"Years ago, I served as a local Church leader. One of our young men, Danny, was outstanding in every way. He was obedient, kind, good, and had a great heart. However, when he graduated from high school, he started to associate with a rough crowd. He got involved in drugs, specifically methamphetamine, and traveled down the slippery slope of addiction and destruction. Before long, his appearance completely changed. He was hardly recognizable. The most significant change was in his eyes—the light in his eyes had dimmed. Several times I reached out to him, but to no avail. He wasn’t interested."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,9,It was difficult to see this incredible young man suffer and live a life that was not him! He was capable of so much more.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,12,"Although he had a desire to change, it was difficult for Danny. His addictions and the accompanying guilt were almost more than he could bear."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,13,"One particular afternoon, when I was out mowing our lawn, Danny pulled up in his car unannounced. He was struggling terribly. I turned off the mower, and we sat down together in the shade of the front porch. It was then that he shared the feelings of his heart. He truly wanted to come back. However, turning away from his addictions and lifestyle was extremely difficult. Adding to this, he felt so guilty, so ashamed for falling so far. He asked, “Can I really be forgiven? Is there really a way back?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,14,"After he poured out his heart with these concerns, we readAlma chapter 36together:"

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,22,"We discussed that Alma had been exceptionally wicked. However, once he repented, he never looked back. He became a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ. He became a prophet! Danny’s eyes widened. “A prophet?” he said."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,23,"I simply responded, “Yes, a prophet. No pressure on you!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,24,"We discussed that while his sins did not rise to the level of Alma’s, the same promise of complete and perfect forgiveness is made to everyone—in and through the infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,25,"Danny now understood. He knew what he needed to do: he needed to begin his journey by trusting in the Lord and forgiving himself!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,26,"Danny’s mighty change of heart was nothing short of a miracle. Over time, his countenance changed, and the brightness in his eyes returned. He became temple worthy! He was finally back!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,27,"After several months, I asked Danny if he would like to submit an application to serve a full-time mission. His response was one of shock and awe."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,28,"He said, “I would love to serve a mission, but you know where I havebeen and the things I have done! I thought I was disqualified.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,29,"I responded, “You may be right. However, there is nothing precluding us from making a request. If you are excused, at least you will know that you expressed a sincere desire to serve the Lord.” His eyes lit up. He was thrilled with this idea. To him this was a long shot, but it was a chance he was willing to take."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,30,"A few weeks later, and to his amazement, another miracle occurred. Danny received a call to serve a full-time mission."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,31,"A few months after Danny arrived in the mission field, I received a telephone call. His president simply said, “What is it with this young man? He is the most incredible missionary I have ever seen!” You see, this president had received a modern-day Alma the Younger."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,32,"Two years later, Danny returned home with honor, having served the Lord with all his heart, might, mind, and strength."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,33,"Following his missionary report in sacrament meeting, I returned home, only to hear a knock at the front door. There stood Danny with tears welling in his eyes. He said, “Can we talk for a minute?” We went outside to the same porch step."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,34,"He said, “President, do you think I have truly been forgiven?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,35,Now my tears accompanied his. Before me stood a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ who had given his all to teaching and testifying about the Savior. He was the embodiment of the healing and strengthening power of the Savior’s Atonement.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,36,"I said, “Danny! Have you looked in the mirror? Have you seen your eyes? They are filled with light, and you are beaming with the Spirit of the Lord. Of course you have been forgiven! You are amazing! Now what you need to do is move forward with your life. Don’t look back! Look forward with faith to the next ordinance.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,37,"Danny’s miracle continues today. He married in the temple and returned to school, where he received a master’s degree. He continues to serve the Lord with honor and dignity in his callings. More important, he has become an incredible husband and a faithful father. He is a devoted disciple of Jesus Christ."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,39,"An incredible demonstration of the Savior’s love for God’s children is recorded in the Book of Mormon: “When Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly uponhim as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them” (3 Nephi 17:5)."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/33nattress,Elder K. Brett Nattress,40,The Savior had already spent a full day ministering to the people. Yet He had more to do—He was to visit His other sheep; He was to go to His Father.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A.

Because it is His Church, we as His servants will minister to the one, just as He did. We will minister in His name, with His power and authority, and with His loving-kindness.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,15,"It is interesting to note that when Luke, the Gospel writer, is introducing the three stories, he uses the wordparablein the singular, not in the plural.It appears that the Lord is teaching one unique lesson with three stories—stories that present different numbers: 100 sheep, 10 coins, and 2 sons."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,16,"The key number in each of these stories, however, is the numberone. And a lesson we might take from that number is that you might be an undershepherd for 100 elders and prospective elders in your elders quorum or an adviser to 10 young women or a teacher to 2 Primary children, but you always, always minister to them, care for them, and love them one by one, individually. You never say, “What a foolish sheep” or “After all, I do not really need that coin” or “What a rebellious son he is.” If you and I have with us “the pure love of Christ,”we, as the man in the story of the lost sheep, will “leave the ninety and nine … and go after that which is lost, until [… until … until we] find it.”Or, as the woman in the story of the lost coin, we will “light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently [… diligently] till [… till … till we] find it.”If we have with us “the pure love of Christ,” we will follow the example of the father in the story of the prodigal son, who, when the son “was yet a great way off, … saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,17,Can we feel the urgency in theheart of the man who lost only one sheep? Or the urgency in the heart of the woman who lost just one coin? Or the ineffable love and compassion in the heart of the prodigal’s father?
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,18,"My wife, Maria Isabel, and I served in Central America, being stationed in Guatemala City. There I had the opportunity to meet Julia, a faithful member of the Church. I had the impression to ask her about her family. Her mother died of cancer in 2011. Her father had been a faithful leader in his stake, serving as a bishop and as a counselor to his stake president for several years. He was a true undershepherd of the Lord. Julia told me of his tireless efforts to visit, to minister, and to serve. He indeed rejoiced in feeding and tending the precious sheep of the Lord. He remarried and stayed active in the Church."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,19,"A few years later, he went through a divorce, and now he had to attend church alone once again.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,20,"Julia spoke highly of this wonderful undershepherd, who was a hardworking, loving, and compassionate man. I vividly remember that a feeling of urgency came to me as she was describing him. I just wanted to do something for that man, a man who had done so much for so many throughout those years."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,21,"She gave me his cell phone number, and I began calling him, hoping to have the chance to meet with him personally. After several weeks and many, many phone calls without success, one day he finally answered the phone."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,22,"I told him that I had met Julia, his daughter, and that I was captivated by the way he had served, ministered, and loved the precious sheep of the Lord for so many years. He was not expecting a comment like that. I told him that I really wanted to visit with him eye to eye, face to face. He asked me my purpose in proposing such a meeting. I replied, “I really want to meet the father of such a wonderful lady.” Then for a few seconds there was silence over the phone—a few seconds that seemed to me like an eternity. He simply said, “When and where?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,23,"The day I met him, I invited him to share with me some of his experiences visiting, ministering, and serving the precious sheep of the Lord. As he was recounting some touching stories, I noticed that the tone of his voice changed and the same spirit he had felt so many times as an undershepherd came back. Now his eyes were filled with tears. I knew this was the right moment for me, but I found that I did not know what to say. I prayed in my mind, “Father, help me.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,24,"Suddenly, I heard myself saying, “Brother Florian, as a servant of the Lord, I apologize for our not being there for you.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/34uceda,Elder Juan A. Uceda,25,"The following Sunday he was back. He had a long conversation with his bishop and remained active. A few months later he passed away—but he had come back. He had come back. I testify that with our Savior’s help, we can love His precious sheep and minister to them as He would. And so, there in Guatemala City the Lord Jesus Christ brought back one more precious sheep into His fold. And He taught me a lesson on ministering that I cannot forget. In the name of the Good Shepherd, the Beautiful Shepherd, the Magnificent Shepherd, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,20,“For I delight in the law of God after the inward man;

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,23,"If individually we each “put on Christ,” then together we can hope to become one, as Paul said, “the body of Christ.”To “put on Christ” certainly includes making His “first and great commandment”our first and greatest commitment, and if we love God, we will keep His commandments."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,24,"Unity with our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ grows as we heed the second commandment—inextricably connected to the first—to love others as ourselves.And I suppose an even more perfect unity would obtain among us if we followed the Savior’s higher and holier expression of this second commandment—to love one another not only as we love ourselves but asHeloved us.In sum, it is “every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.”"

If one man lives it, he has peace within himself. If two men live it, they each have peace within themselves and with each other. If the citizens live it, the nation has domestic peace. When there are enough nations enjoying the fruit of the Spirit to control world affairs, then, and only then, will the war-drums throb no longer, and the battle flags be furl’d. … (See Alfred Lord Tennyson, “Locksley Hall,”The Complete Poetical Works of Tennyson, ed. W. J. Rolfe, Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 1898, p. 93, lines 27–28.)”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,28,"When we “put on Christ,” it becomes possible either to resolve or to lay aside differences, disagreements, and disputes. A rather dramatic example of overcoming division is found in our Church history. Elder Brigham Henry Roberts (commonly known as B. H. Roberts), born in England in 1857, served as a member of the First Council of the Seventy—what we refer to today as the Presidency of the Seventy. Elder Roberts was an able and tireless defender of the restored gospel and of the Church in some of its most difficult times."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,29,"In 1895, however, Elder Roberts’s service in the Church was put in jeopardy by contention. B. H. had been appointed as a delegate to the convention that drafted a constitution for Utah when it became a state. Afterward, he decided to become a candidate for the United States Congress but did not notify or seek permission from the First Presidency.President Joseph F. Smith, a counselor in the First Presidency, censured B. H. for that failure in a general priesthood meeting. Elder Roberts lost the election and felt his defeat was due in large part to President Smith’s statements. He was critical of Church leaders in some political speeches and interviews. He withdrew from active Church service. In a lengthy meeting in the Salt Lake Temple with members of the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve, B. H. remained adamant in justifying himself. Later, “President [Wilford] Woodruff gave [Elder Roberts] three weeks to reconsider his position. If he remained unrepentant, they would release him from the Seventy.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,30,"In a subsequent private meeting with Apostles Heber J. Grant and Francis Lyman, B. H. was initially unyielding, but love and the Holy Spirit ultimately prevailed. Tears came to his eyes. The two Apostles were able to respond to certain perceived slights and offenses that troubled B. H., and they left with a heartfelt plea for reconciliation. The next morning, after lengthy prayer, Elder Roberts sent a note to Elders Grant and Lyman that he was prepared to reunite with his brethren."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,31,"When he later met with the First Presidency, Elder Roberts said, “I went to the Lord and received light and instruction through His Spirit to submit to the authority of God.”Motivated by his love of God, B. H. Roberts remained a faithful and an able Church leader to the end of his life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,32,"We can also see in this example that unity does not mean simply agreeing that everyone should do his or her own thing or go his or her own way. We cannot be one unless we all bend our efforts to the common cause. It means, in B. H. Roberts’s words, submitting to the authority of God. We are different members of the body of Christ, fulfilling different functions at different times—the ear, the eye, the head, the hand, the feet—yet all of one body.Therefore, our goal is “that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,33,"Unity does not require sameness, but it does require harmony. We can have our hearts knit together in love, be one in faith and doctrine, and still cheer for different teams, disagree on various political issues, debate about goals and the right way to achieve them, and many other such things. But we can never disagree or contend with anger or contempt for one another. Said the Savior:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,34,"“For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,35,"“Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,36,"A year ago, President Russell M. Nelson pled with us in these words: “None of us can control nations or the actions of others or even members of our own families. But we can control ourselves. My call today, dear brothers and sisters, is to end conflicts that are raging inyourheart,yourhome, andyourlife. Bury any and all inclinations to hurt others—whether those inclinations be a temper, a sharp tongue, or a resentment for someone who has hurt you. The Savior commanded us to turn the other cheek [see3 Nephi 12:39], to love our enemies, and to pray for those who despitefully use us [see3 Nephi 12:44].”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,37,"I say again that it is only in and through our individual loyalty to and love of Jesus Christ that we can hope to be one—one within, one at home, one in the Church, eventually one in Zion, and above all, one with the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,38,"I return to the events of Holy Week and the ultimate triumph of our Redeemer. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ bears witness of His divinity and that He has overcome all things. His Resurrection bears witness that,bound to Him by covenant, we too may overcome all things and become one. His Resurrection bears witness that through Him, immortality and eternal life are realities."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/41christofferson,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,39,"This morning, I bear witness of His literal Resurrection and all that it implies, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Johnson,4,"With faith in Jesus Christ and hope in what they had heard of His miracles, the caregivers of a man with palsy brought him to Jesus. They were innovative in getting him there—uncovering the roof and lowering the man, on his bed, to the place where Jesus was teaching. When Jesus “saw their faith, he said [to the man with palsy], thy sins are forgiven thee.”And then, “Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.”And immediately the man with palsy arose and took his bed and departed for home, “glorifying God.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,5,"What more do we know of the friends who provided care for the man with palsy?

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,6,"Jesus Christ had provided the hoped-for healing—physicalrelieffrom pain and the crippling consequences of chronic disease. Significantly, the Savior also provided spiritualreliefin cleansing the man from sin."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,7,"And the friends—in their efforts to care for one in need, they found the source of relief; they found Jesus Christ."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,9,"And because we love God and have covenanted to serve Him, we can partner with the Savior to help provide temporal and spiritual relief for those in need—and in the process find our own relief in Jesus Christ."

It may be a basket balanced on your head or a satchel or a bundle of things wrapped in cloth and thrown over your shoulder. But for our thinking, let’s call it a backpack."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,12,"This metaphorical backpack is where we carry the burdens of living in a fallen world. Our burdens are like rocks in the backpack. Generally, there are three kinds:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,13,Rocks there of our own doing because of sin.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,14,"Rocks in our backpack because of the poor decisions, misconduct, and unkindness of others."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,15,"And rocks we carry because we are living in a fallen condition. These include the rocks of disease, pain, chronic illness, grief, disappointment, loneliness, and the effects of natural disasters."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,16,"I joyfully declare that our mortal burdens, these rocks in our figurative backpack, need not feel heavy."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,17,Jesus Christ can lighten our load.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,18,Jesus Christ can lift our burdens.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,19,Jesus Christ provides a way for us to be relieved of the weight of sin.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,20,Jesus Christ is our relief.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,21,"He said:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,22,"“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest [that is, relief and peace]."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,24,"“For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,26,So why are we stingy with our rocks? Why would a weary baseball pitcher refuse to leave the mound when a reliever is there ready to complete the game? Why would I insist on maintaining my post alone when the Reliever stands ready to keep it with me?
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,27,"President Nelson has taught, “Jesus Christ … stands with open arms, hoping and willing to heal, forgive, cleanse, strengthen, purify, and sanctify us.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,28,So why do we insist on carrying our rocks alone?
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,29,It is intended as a personal question for each of you to consider.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,30,"For me, it is the age-old vice of pride. “I’ve got this,” I say. “No worries; I’ll get it done.” It’s the great deceiver who wants me to hide from God, to turn away from Him, to go at it alone."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,31,"Brothers and sisters, I can’t go at it alone, and I don’t need to, and I won’t.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,32,Covenant keepers are blessed with the Savior’s relief.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,33,"Consider this example in the Book of Mormon: The people of Alma were persecuted with “tasks upon them, and … task-masters over them.”Forbidden to pray vocally, they “did pour out their hearts to [God]; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,37,"Those covenant keepers received relief in the form of comfort, increased patience and cheerfulness, an ease in their burdens so that they felt light, and ultimately deliverance."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,38,Now let’s return to our own metaphorical backpack.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,39,"Repentance, through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, is what relieves us of the weight of the rocks of sin. And by this exquisite gift, God’s mercy relieves us from the heavy and otherwise insurmountable demands of justice."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,40,"The Atonement of Jesus Christ also makes it possible for us to receive strength to forgive, which allows us to unload the weight we carry because of mistreatment by others."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,41,So how does the Savior relieve us of the burdens of living in a fallen world with mortal bodies subject to grief and pain?
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,42,"Often, He performs that kind of relief through us! As covenant members of His Church, we promise “to mourn with those that mourn” and “comfort those that stand in need of comfort.”Because we are “come into the fold of God” and are “called his people,” we “are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,43,"Our covenantal blessing is to partner with Jesus Christ in providing relief, both temporal and spiritual, to all of God’s children. We are a conduit through which He provides relief."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,44,"And so, like the friends of the man with palsy, we “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.”We “bear … one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”As we do, we come to know Him, become like Him, and find His relief."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,45,What is relief?
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,46,"It is the removal or lightening of something painful, troubling, or burdensome, or the strength to endure it. It refers to a person who takes the place of another. It is the legal correction of a wrong.The Anglo-French word comes from Old French, the wordrelever, or “to raise up,” and from the Latinrelevare, or “raise again.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,47,"Brothers and sisters, Jesus Christ is relief. I testify that He did rise again on the third day and, having fulfilled the loving and infinite Atonement, stands with open arms, offering to us the opportunity to rise again, be saved,andbe exalted and become like Him.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,48,"Like the women visited by the angel on that first Easter morning, I wish to “go quickly” and with “great joy” to bring the word that He is risen.In the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/42johnson,President Camille N. Johnson,71,"Relief Society, the women’s organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was organized by the Prophet Joseph Smith on March 17, 1842, as “a divinely established appendage to the priesthood” (Dallin H. Oaks, “The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood,”EnsignorLiahona, May 2014, 51). In selecting a name for the new organization, the wordbenevolentwas considered, butreliefwas favored by the women. Emma Smith, the organization’s first president, and Eliza R. Snow, its secretary who later served as the second president of the Relief Society, explained thatbenevolentwas a popular word—popular with the institutions of the day—but that popular “should not be our guide.” Emma expounded that the wordreliefbetter described their mission. “We are going to do something extraordinary … we expect extraordinary occasions and pressing calls” (Emma Smith, in Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book, Mar. 17, 1842, 12, josephsmithpapers.org). Indeed, the mandate of Relief Society has always been to provide temporal and spiritual relief. Joseph Smith taught, “The Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls” (in Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book, June 9, 1842, 63, josephsmithpapers.org). And so the Relief Society continues to provide relief: “Relief of poverty, relief of illness; relief of doubt, relief of ignorance—relief of all that hinders the joy and progress of woman” (John A. Widtsoe,Evidences and Reconciliations, arr. G. Homer Durham, 3 vols. in 1 [1960], 308)."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,4,"In fulfillment of the prophecy given to Zechariah,Jesus triumphantly entered the Holy City riding upon a donkey, which was considered in literature an “ancient symbol of Jewish royalty,”as indeed befitted the King of kings and Prince of Peace.He was surrounded by a multitude of jubilant disciples who spread out their garments, palm leaves, and other foliage along the path where Jesus passed. They praised God, saying with a loud voice, “Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.”And again, “Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”This majestic event, which we celebrate on this day known as Palm Sunday, was a joyful prelude to the excruciating events that would occur during that fateful week culminating in the Savior’s selfless sacrifice and the magnificent miracle of the empty tomb."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,5,"As His followers, we are His peculiar people, called to proclaim His virtues,promoters of the peace so generously offered through Him and His atoning sacrifice. This peace is a gift promised to all who turn their hearts to the Savior and live righteously; such peace gives us the strength to enjoy mortal life and enables us to endure the painful trials of our journey."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,6,"In 1847, the Lord gave specific instructions to the pioneer Saints, who needed peace to remain calm and united as they faced unexpected difficulties on their westward journey. Among other things, the Lord instructed the Saints to “cease to contend one with another; cease to speak evil one of another.”The scriptures affirm that those who practice works of righteousness and strive to walk in the meekness of the Spirit of the Lord are promised the peace they need to survive the days of commotion in which we live today."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,7,"As disciples of the Prince of Peace, we have been instructed to live with “hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.”Our beloved prophet, President Russell M. Nelson, recently stated, “Contention violates everything the Savior stood for and taught.”Our prophet also implored that we do all we can to end personal conflicts that are currently raging in our hearts and in our lives."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,8,"Let us consider these principles in view of Christ’s pure love for us that we, as His followers, seek to have for one another. The scriptures define this kind of love as charity.When we think of charity, our minds usually turn to generous acts and donations to relieve the suffering of those who are experiencing physical, material, or emotional difficulties. Still, charity is not only related to something we donate to someone, but it’s an attribute of the Savior and can become part of our character. It is not surprising that the Lord instructed us to clothe ourselves “with the bond of charity, … which is the bond of perfectness and peace.”Without charity, we are nothingand we cannot inherit the place the Lord has prepared for us in the mansions of our Heavenly Father."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,9,"Jesus perfectly exemplified what it means to own this bond of perfection and peace, especially when facing the agonizing events that preceded His martyrdom. Think for a moment about what Jesus must have felt as He humbly washed His disciples’ feet,knowing that one of them would betray Him that very night.Or when Jesus, hours later, mercifully healed the ear of one of the men who had accompanied Judas, His betrayer, to arrest Him.Or even when the Savior, standing in front of Pilate, was unfairly accused by the chief priests and elders, and not a word He uttered against the false charges against Him, and He left the Roman governor marveling."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,10,"Through these three tragic incidents, the Savior, despite being burdened with excessive sadness and stress, taught us by His example that “charity suffereth long, and is kind; … envieth not; … vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, [and] thinketh no evil.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,11,"Another important aspect to emphasize, and one that has direct implications on our discipleship and how we promote the peace of the Savior, is the manner in which we treat each other. During His earthly ministry, the Savior’s teachings focused—not only, but particularly—on the virtues of love, charity, patience, humility, and compassion—fundamental attributes to those who want to become closer to Him and promote His peace. Such attributes are gifts from God, and as we strive to develop them, we will begin to see our neighbor’s differences and weaknesses with more empathy, sensitivity, respect, and tolerance. One of the most evident signs that we are drawing closer to the Savior and becoming more like Him is the loving, patient, and kind way with which we treat our fellow beings, whatever the circumstances."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,12,"We often see people who engage in negative and even derogatory comments about the perceived characteristics, weaknesses, and opinions of others, mainly when such characteristics and opinions differ or contradict how they act and think. It is very common to see these people passing on such comments to others, who repeat what they heard without truly knowing all the circumstances surrounding a situation. Unfortunately, social media encourages this kind of behavior in the name of relative truths and transparency. Without restraint, digital conversation often leads people to personal attacks and heated disputes, creating disappointments, wounding hearts, and spreading flaming hostility."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,13,"Nephi prophesied that in the latter days, the enemy would rage and stir up people to anger against what is good.The scriptures teach that “every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.”On the other hand, “that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,14,"Considering this prophetic teaching, it is not surprising that one of the adversary’s tactics is to stir up enmity and hate in the hearts of God’s children. He rejoices when he sees people criticizing, ridiculing, and slandering one another. This behavior can destroy a person’s character, reputation, and self-esteem, particularly when the person is judged unfairly. It is critical to point out that when we allow this type of attitude in our lives, we make room in our hearts for the enemy to plant the seed of discord among us, risking falling into his voracious trap."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,15,"If we are not careful with our thoughts, words, and actions, we may end up being entangled by the cunning tricks of the enemy, destroying our relationships with the people around us and our loved ones."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,16,"Brothers and sisters, as the Lord’s peculiar people and promoters of His peace, we cannot afford to allow these tricks of the evil one to take place in our hearts. We cannot carry such a corrosive burden that destroys feelings, relationships, and even lives. The gospel represents good tidings of great joy."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,17,"Of course, none of us is perfect, and certainly there are times when we are beguiled into this type of behavior. In His perfect love and omniscient knowledge of our human tendencies, the Savior always tries to warn us of such dangers. He taught us, “For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,18,"My dear brothers and sisters, as we strive to develop attributes like the Savior’s, we can become instruments of His peace in the world according to the pattern that He Himself established. I invite you to consider ways we can transform ourselves into uplifting and supportive people, people who have an understanding and forgiving heart, people who look for the best in others, always remembering that “if there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,19,"I promise you that as we pursue and develop these attributes, we will become more and more cordial and sensitive to the needs of our fellow beingsand will experience joy, peace, and spiritual growth.Undoubtedly, the Lord will recognize our efforts and give us the gifts we need to be more tolerant and patient with one another’s differences, weaknesses, and imperfections. Furthermore, we will be better able to resist the urge to take offense or offend those who hurt us. Our desire to forgive, as the Savior did, those who mistreat us or speak evil about us will surely increase and will become part of our character."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,20,"May we today, on this Palm Sunday, spread out our robes of love and palm leaves of charity, walking in the footsteps of the Prince of Peace as we prepare to celebrate, this coming Sunday, the miracle of the empty tomb. As brothers and sisters in Christ, let us joyfully proclaim, “Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/43soares,Elder Ulisses Soares,21,"I testify that Jesus Christ lives and that His perfect love, expressed through His atoning sacrifice, is extended to all who desire to walk with Him and enjoy His peace in this world and in the world to come. I say these things in the holy name of the Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, amen."

It was a great message and inspired us all. My dear brothers and sisters, may I talk about patriarchal blessings as well? Patriarchs, as requests for patriarchal blessings may increase, I pray that the Lord will bless you as you continue to magnify your calling."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,5,"As I go to stake conferences, I always visit with the stake patriarch and his spouse. Patriarchs are gentle, obedient, and incredible leaders called of God. They tell me many wonderful spiritual experiences. I ask them the age of the youngest and the oldest person to whom they have given a blessing. So far the youngest was 11, and the oldest was 93."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,6,"I received my patriarchal blessing as a new member of the Church, at age 19, two years after I was baptized. My patriarch was incredibly old. He joined the Church in 1916 and was a pioneer of the Church in Japan. It was my great honor to receive my patriarchal blessing from that remarkable disciple of the Lord. His Japanese was a bit difficult for me to understand, but it was powerful."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,7,"The patriarchs I have met tell me that many individuals receive their patriarchal blessings just before serving a mission. My dear young men, young women, parents, and bishops, patriarchal blessings are not only for preparation to serve a mission. Worthy baptized members may receive their patriarchal blessing when the time is right for them."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,8,"Dear adult members, some of you have not yet received your patriarchal blessings. Remember, there is no maximum age."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,9,"My mother-in-law was a very active Church member, serving as a Relief Society teacher until she passed away at age 91. I was sad to learn that she did not receive a patriarchal blessing. She experienced many difficulties in her life, and because she did not have a priesthood holder in the home, she did not receive many priesthood blessings. A patriarchal blessing may have given her comfort when she needed it most."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,10,"Adults, if you have not yet received a patriarchal blessing, please do not worry! Everyone’s spiritual timelineis different. If you are 35 or 85 and you have a desire, talk to your bishop about receiving your blessing."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,11,"New members of the Church, have you heard of patriarchal blessings? I didn’t know about the opportunity to receive one when I joined the Church, but my beloved bishop told me about patriarchal blessings and encouraged me to prepare to receive mine after I was baptized. My dear new members, you can receive a patriarchal blessing as well. The Lord will help you prepare for this sacred opportunity."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,12,"Let’s consider two purposes for a patriarchal blessing:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,13,A patriarchal blessing contains personal counsel from the Lord to you.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,14,A patriarchal blessing declares your lineage in the house of Israel.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,15,"Your patriarchal blessing is a message from your Heavenly Father and will likely include promises and inspired counsel to guide you throughout your life. A patriarchal blessing is not going to map out your life or answer all your questions. If it doesn’t mention an important life event, do not take that to mean you won’t have that opportunity. Likewise, there is no guarantee everything in your blessing will come to pass in this life. A patriarchal blessing is eternal, and if you live worthy, promises that are not fulfilled in this life will be granted in the next."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,16,"As you receive a declaration of lineage, you will come to know that you are of the house of Israel and the seed of Abraham.To understand the significance of this, focus on the promises the Lord made to the house of Israel through Abraham."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,17,"Those promises include:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,18,"“His posterity would be numerous (seeGenesis 17:5–6;Abraham 2:9;3:14)."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,19,"“His seed, or descendants, would receive the gospel and bear the priesthood (seeAbraham 2:9)."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,20,"“Through the ministry of his seed, ‘all the families of the earth [would] be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal’ (Abraham 2:11).”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,21,"As members of the Church, we are children of the covenant.We receive the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant as we obey the laws and ordinances of the gospel."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,22,"Preparation for your patriarchal blessing will help you increase yourfaith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. And when you receive your patriarchal blessing and read and ponder it, you can focus on Them more often."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,23,"President Thomas S. Monson explained, “The same Lord who provided a Liahona for Lehi provides for you and for me today a rare and valuable gift to give direction to our lives, to mark the hazards to our safety, and to chart the way, even safe passage—not to a promised land, but to our heavenly home.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,24,"My dear bishops, parents, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, ward mission leaders, ministering brothers and sisters, please encourage those young men and young women, adult members, and new members who have not yet received their patriarchal blessing to seek the Lord’s direction and help in preparing themselves to do so."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,25,"I frequently and prayerfully read my patriarchal blessing; it always gives me encouragement. I recognize what the Lord expects of me, and it has helped me to repent and be humble. When I read and ponder it, I desire to live worthy of receiving its promised blessings."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,26,"Just as scriptures we have read many times have new meaning to us later, our patriarchal blessing will have a different meaning to us at different times. Mine has a different meaning now than it did when I was 30 and when I was 50. It is not that the words change, but we see them in a different way."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,27,"President Dallin H. Oaks declared that a patriarchal blessing “is given under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and should be read and interpreted under the influence of that same Spirit. The meaning and significance of a patriarchal blessing will be taught line upon line in the course of time by the power of the same Spirit that inspired [it].”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/44yamashita,Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita,28,"Brothers and sisters, I bear my witness that Heavenly Father and His Beloved and Only Begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, live. They love us. Patriarchal blessings are sacred gifts from Them. When you receive your blessing, you will realize and feel how They love you and how They focus on you individually."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,4,"In this beautiful Easter season, I echo the prayer of this powerful hymn, “Guide us, O thou great Jehovah.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,5,"A remarkable story in the Book of Mormon tells of a young man, from a prominent family, named Alma, whom the scriptures describe as an idolatrous unbeliever.He was articulate and convincing, using flattery to persuade others to follow him. Astonishingly, an angel appeared to Alma and his friends. Alma fell to the earth and was so weak that he was carried helplessly to his father’s home. He remained in a seemingly comatose state for three days.Later, he explained that while he appeared unconscious to those around him, his mind was very active as his soul grieved, thinking about his life of disregarding the commandments of God. He described his mind as being “harrowed up by the memory of [his] many sins”and “racked with eternal torment.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,6,"In his deep despair, he remembered being taught in his youth about “the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.”Next he made this very compelling statement: “As my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me.”As he appealed for the divine power of the Savior, something miraculous happened: “When I thought this,” he said, “I could remember my pains no more.”Suddenly he felt peace and light. “Nothing [was] so exquisite and sweet as was my joy,”he declared."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,7,"Alma “caught hold upon” the truth of Jesus Christ. If we were using the words “caught hold upon” in aphysical sense, we might say, “He caught hold upon the guardrail just as he was falling,” meaning he reached out suddenly and tightly seized something solidly cemented to a secure foundation."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,8,"In Alma’s case, it was his mind that reached out and secured this powerful truth of Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice. Acting in faith on that truth, and by the power and grace of God, he was rescued from despair and filled with hope."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,9,"While our experiences may not be as dramatic as Alma’s, they are nonetheless as eternally significant. Our minds have also “caught hold upon this thought” of Jesus Christ and His merciful sacrifice, and our souls have felt the light and joy that follow."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,10,"My prayer at this Easter season is that we will more consciously shape, strengthen, and secure this preeminent thought of Jesus Christ in the chambers of our soul,allowing it to eagerly flow into our mind, guide us in what we think and do, and continually bring the sweet joy of the Savior’s love."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,11,"Filling our mind with the power of Jesus Christ does not mean that He is the only thought we have. But it does mean that all our thoughts are circumscribed in His love, His life and teachings, and His atoning sacrifice and glorious Resurrection. Jesus is never in a forgotten corner, because our thoughts of Him are always present and “all that is in [us adores] him!”We pray and rehearse in our mind experiences that have brought us closer to Him. We welcome into our mind divine images, holy scriptures, and inspired hymns to gently cushion the countless daily thoughts rushing through our busy lives. Our love for Him does not shield us from the sadness and sorrow in this mortal life, but it allows us to walk through the challenges with a strength far beyond our own."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,12,"Jesus, the very thought of thee"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,13,With sweetness fills my breast;
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,14,But sweeter far thy face to see
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,15,And in thy presence rest.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,16,"Remember, you are a spirit child of Heavenly Father. As the Apostle Paul explains, we are “the offspring of God.”You have lived with your own individual identity long before coming to earth. Our Father created a perfect plan for us to come to earth, learn, and return to Him. He sent His Beloved Son that through the power of His infinite Atonement and Resurrection, we live beyond the grave; and as we are willing to exercise faith in Him and repent of our sins,we are forgiven and receive the hope of eternal life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,17,"In this mortal life, our mind and spirit need exceptional attention.Our mind allows us to live, to choose, and to discern good and evil.Our spirit receives the confirming witness that God is our Father, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that Their teachings are our guide to happiness here and eternal life beyond the grave."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,18,"The mind of Alma caught hold upon this thought of Jesus Christ. It changed his life. General conference is a time to understand what the Lord would have us do and become. It is also a time to reflect on our progress. As my assignments have taken me throughout the world, I have observed an increasing spiritualstrength in the righteous, devoted members of the Church."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,19,"Five years ago, we were asked to place the Savior more prominently in all we do by using the true name of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.We are speaking His name more earnestly."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,20,"Four years ago, by reducing the time of our sacrament meeting, we increased our focus on partaking of the Lord’s sacrament. We are thinking more of Jesus Christ and are more serious in our promise to always remember Him."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,21,"With the isolation of the worldwide pandemic and the help ofCome, Follow Me, the teachings of the Savior are becoming more prominent in our homes, helping our worship of the Savior during the week."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,22,"By following President Russell M. Nelson’s counsel to “hear Him,”we are refining our ability to recognize the whisperings of the Holy Ghost and to see the hand of the Lord in our lives."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,23,"With the announcement and completion of dozens of temples, we are more frequently entering the house of the Lord and receiving His promised blessings. We are feeling more powerfully the transcendent beauty of our Savior and Redeemer."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,24,"President Nelson said: “There is nothing easy or automatic about becoming [a] powerful [disciple]. Our focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him ineverythought.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,25,"By focusing our attention on Jesus Christ, all else around us—while still present—is viewed through our love for Him. Less important distractions fade, and we remove those things that are not in keeping with His light and character. As you continue to attentively catch hold of this thought of Jesus Christ, trust in Him, and keep His commandments, I promise you not only heavenly guidance but heavenly power—power that brings strength to your covenants, peace to your difficulties, and joy to your blessings."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,26,"A few weeks ago, Kathy and I visited the home of Matt and Sarah Johnson. On the wall was a picture of their precious family, a beautiful image of the Savior, and an illustration of the temple."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,27,"Their four daughters, Maddy, Ruby, Claire, and June, spoke happily about how much they loved their mother."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,28,For over a year Sarah had regularly scheduled Saturday appointments for the family to attend the temple together so that the girls could participate in baptisms for family members who lived previously.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,29,"In November of last year, Sarah scheduled a family temple appointment for the last week in December on Thursday instead of Saturday. “I hope you’re OK with that,” she said to Matt."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,30,"Sarah had been diagnosed with cancer, but the doctors anticipated she would live two or three more years. During a sacrament meeting, Sarah had shared her powerful testimony, saying that whatever the outcome for her, she loved the Savior with all her heart and that “the victory had already been won” by Him. As December progressed, unexpectedly Sarah’s health rapidly declined, and she was admitted to the hospital. In the early morning of Thursday, December 29, she quietly completed her mortality. Matt had been by Sarah’s side all through the night."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,31,"With his heart breaking, and completely exhausted physically and emotionally, he arrived home, sorrowing with his daughters. As Matt glanced at his phone, he noticed the reminder of the unusual Thursday temple appointment Sarah had scheduled forlater that day. Matt said, “When I first saw it, I thought, This just isn’t going to work.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,32,"But then Matt’s mind caught hold upon this thought: “The Savior lives. There is no place we would rather be as a family than in His holy house.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,33,"Matt, Maddy, Ruby, Claire, and June arrived at the temple for the appointment Sarah had scheduled for them. With tears streaming down his cheeks, Matt performed the baptisms with his daughters. They deeply felt their love and eternal bond with Sarah, and they felt the immense love and comforting peace of the Savior. Matt tenderly shared, “While I feel deep sorrow and grief, I am shouting for joy, knowing my Father’s wonderful plan of salvation.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L. Andersen,34,"In this Easter season, I witness the complete and absolute truth of the Savior’s incomparable atoning sacrifice and of His glorious Resurrection. As your mind remains firmly and forever upon the thought of Jesus Christ, and as you continue to focus your life more fully on the Savior, I promise you that you will feel His hope, His peace, and His love. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/45andersen,Elder Neil L.

The Book of Mormon encourages us by using the word twice, one after another: “remember, remember” (Mosiah 2:41;Alma 37:13;Helaman 5:9). Spiritually remembering comes through the power of the Holy Ghost: “He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance” (John 14:26)."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,5,"Brothers and sisters, it is almost impossible to hear these words from the Prophet Joseph Smith and not break out into a great big smile!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,6,"Joseph’s jubilant expression truly captures the full and majestic joy found in God our Heavenly Father’s great plan of happiness, for He has assured us, “Men are, that they might have joy.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,7,"We all shouted for joyin our premortal life when we heard God’s plan of happiness, and we continue to shout for joy here as we live according to His plan. But what exactly was the context for this happy declaration from the Prophet? What spurred these deep and heartfelt emotions?"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,8,"The Prophet Joseph had been teaching about baptism for the dead. This was indeed a glorious revelation that was received with great joy. When Church members first learned that they could be baptized for their deceased loved ones, they rejoiced. Wilford Woodruff said, “The moment I heard of it, my soul leaped [for] joy!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,9,"Baptism for our deceased loved ones wasn’t the only truth the Lord would reveal and restore. There were a host of other gifts, or endowments, that God had been eager to bestow upon His sons and daughters."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,10,"These other gifts included priesthood authority, covenants and ordinances, marriages that could last forever, the sealing of children to their parents within the family of God, and ultimately the blessing of returning home to the presence of God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ. All these blessings were made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,11,"Because God considered these to be among His highest and holiest blessings,He instructed that sacred buildings be erected where He could confer these precious gifts upon His children.These buildings would be His home on earth. These buildings would be temples where that which was sealed or bound on earth in His name, by His word, and with His authority would be bound in the heavens."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,12,"As members of the Church today, some of us may find it easy to take these glorious eternal truths for granted. They have become second nature to us. Sometimes it is helpful when we see them through the eyes of those who learn about them for the very first time. This became evident to me through a recent experience."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,13,"Last year, just prior to the rededication of the Tokyo Japan Temple, many guests not of our faith toured that temple. One such tour included a thoughtful leader from anotherreligion. We taught our guest about Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness, Jesus Christ’s redeeming role in that plan, and the doctrine that families can be united eternally through the sealing ordinance."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,14,"At the conclusion of the tour, I invited our friend to share his feelings. In reference to the uniting of families—past, present, and future—this good man asked in all sincerity, “Do the members of your faith truly understand just how profound this doctrine is?” He added, “This may well be one of the only teachings that can unite this world that is so divided.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,15,What a powerful observation. This man was not moved simply by the exquisite craftsmanship of the temple but rather by the stunning and profound doctrine that families are united and sealed to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ forever.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,16,"We should not be surprised, then, when even someone not of our faith recognizes the majesty of what happens in the temple. What could become common or routine for us is sometimes seen in its splendor and majesty by those who hear it or feel it for the very first time."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,17,"Although temples had existed anciently, with the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the building of temples has been one of the highest priorities of all prophets since the Prophet Joseph Smith. And it is easy to understand why."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,18,"When the Prophet Joseph was teaching about baptism for the dead, he revealed another great truth. He taught: “Let me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, … they without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,19,"As we can see, the need for temples and the work that is done for both the living and the dead become very clear."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,20,"The adversary is on the alert. His power is threatened by the ordinances and covenants performed in temples, and he does anything he can to try to stop the work. Why? Because he knows of the power that comes from this sacred work. As each new temple is dedicated, the saving power of Jesus Christ expands throughout the world to counteract the efforts of the adversary and to redeem us as we come unto Him. As temples and covenant keepers grow in number, the adversary grows weaker."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,21,"In the early days of the Church, some would worry when a new temple would be announced, for they would say, “We never began to build a temple without the bells of hell starting to ring.” But Brigham Young courageously retorted, “I want to hear them ring again.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,22,"In this mortal life, we will never escape the war, but we can have power over the enemy. That power and strength come from Jesus Christ as we make and keep temple covenants."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,23,"President Russell M. Nelson has taught: “The time is coming when those who do not obey the Lord will be separated from those who do. Our safest insurance is to continue to be worthy of admission to His holy house.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,24,"Here are some additional blessings God has promised us through His prophet:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,25,"Do you need miracles? Our prophet has said: “I promise you that the Lord will bring the miracles He knows you need as you make sacrifices to serve and worship in His temples.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,26,"Do you need the healing and strengthening power of the Savior Jesus Christ? President Nelson reassures us that “everything taught in the temple … increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. … As we keep our covenants, He endows us withHishealing, strengthening power. And oh, how we will need His power in the days ahead.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,27,"On the first Palm Sunday, as Jesus Christ triumphantly entered Jerusalem, a multitude of His disciples “rejoice[d] and praise[d] God with a loud voice … saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,28,"How fitting that on Palm Sunday of 1836, the Kirtland Temple was being dedicated. On that occasion the disciples of Jesus Christ were rejoicing as well. In that dedicatory prayer, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared these words of praise:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,29,"“O Lord God Almighty, hear us … and answer us from heaven, … where thou sittest enthroned, with glory, honor, power, majesty, [and] might. …"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,30,"“… Help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/46duncan,Elder Kevin R. Duncan,31,“And let these … thy saints shout aloud for joy.”

During these past six months, you have been constantly on my mind and in my prayers. I pray that the Holy Ghost will communicate what the Lord wants you to hear as I speak to you now."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,5,"During my surgical internship many years ago, I assisted a surgeon who was amputating a leg filled with highly infectious gangrene. The operation was difficult. Then, to add to the tension, one of the team performed a task poorly, and the surgeon erupted in anger. In the middle of his tantrum, he threw his scalpel loaded with germs. It landed inmyforearm!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,6,"Everyone in the operating room—except the out-of-control surgeon—was horrified by this dangerous breach of surgical practice. Gratefully, I did not become infected. But this experience left a lasting impression on me. In that very hour, I promised myself thatwhateverhappened inmyoperating room, I wouldneverlose control of my emotions. I also vowed that day never to throw anything in anger—whether it be scalpels or words."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,7,"Even now, decades later, I find myself wondering if the contaminated scalpel that landed in my arm was any more toxic than the venomous contention that infects our civic dialogue and too many personal relationships today. Civility and decency seem to have disappeared during this era of polarization and passionate disagreements."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,8,"Vulgarity, faultfinding, and evil speaking of others are all too common. Too many pundits, politicians, entertainers, and other influencers throw insults constantly. I am greatly concerned that so many people seem to believe that it is completely acceptable to condemn, malign, and vilifyanyonewho does not agree with them. Many seem eager to damage another’s reputation with pathetic and pithy barbs!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,9,"Anger never persuades. Hostility builds no one. Contention never leads to inspired solutions. Regrettably, we sometimes see contentious behavior even within our own ranks. We hear of those who belittle their spouses and children, of those who use angry outbursts to control others, and of those who punish family members with the “silent treatment.” We hear of youth and children who bully and of employees who defame their colleagues."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,10,"My dear brothers and sisters, this should not be. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are to be examples of how to interact with others—especiallywhen we have differences of opinion. One of the easiest ways to identify atrue followerof Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,11,"The Savior made this clear in His sermons to followers in both hemispheres. “Blessed are the peacemakers,” He said.“Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.”And then, of course, He gave the admonition that challenges each of us: “Love yourenemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,12,"Before His death, the Savior commanded His Twelve Apostles to love one another as He had loved them.And then He added, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,13,"The Savior’s message is clear: Histruedisciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire—no matter how difficult the situation. True disciples of Jesus Christ are peacemakers."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,14,"Today is Palm Sunday. We are preparing to commemorate the most important and transcendent event ever recorded on earth, which is the Atonement and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. One of the best ways we can honor the Savior is to become a peacemaker."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,15,"The Savior’s Atonement made it possible for us to overcomeallevil—including contention. Make no mistake about it: contentionisevil! Jesus Christ declared that those who have “the spirit of contention” are not of Him but are “of the devil, who is the father of contention, and [the devil] stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.”Those who foster contention are taking a page out of Satan’s playbook, whether they realize it or not. “No man can serve two masters.”We cannot support Satan with our verbal assaults and then think that we can still serve God."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,16,"My dear brothers and sisters, how we treat each other really matters! How we speak to and about others at home, at church, at work, and online really matters. Today, I am asking us to interact with others in a higher, holier way. Please listen carefully.“If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy”that we can say about another person—whether to his face or behind her back—that should beourstandard of communication."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,17,"If a couple in your ward gets divorced, or a young missionary returns home early, or a teenager doubts his testimony, they do not need your judgment. They need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in your words and actions."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,18,"If a friend on social media has strong political or social views that violate everything you believe in, an angry, cutting retort by you will not help. Building bridges of understanding will require much more of you, but that is exactly what your friend needs."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,19,"Contention drives away the Spirit—every time. Contention reinforces the false notion that confrontation is the way to resolve differences; but it never is. Contention is a choice. Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation. I urge you tochooseto be a peacemaker, now and always."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,20,"Brothers and sisters, we can literally change the world—one person and one interaction at a time. How? By modeling how to manage honest differences of opinion with mutual respect and dignified dialogue."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,21,Differences of opinion are part of life. I work every day with dedicated servants of the Lord who do not always see an issue the same way. They know I want to hear their ideas and honest feelings about everything we discuss—especiallysensitive issues.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,22,"My two noble counselors, President Dallin H. Oaks and President Henry B. Eyring, are exemplary in the way they express their feelings—especially when they may differ. They do so with pure love for each other. Neither suggests that he knows best and therefore must rigorously defend his position. Neither evidences the need to compete with the other. Because each is filled with charity, “the pure love of Christ,”our deliberations can be guided by the Spirit of the Lord. How I love and honor these two great men!"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,23,"Charity is the antidote to contention. Charity is the spiritual gift that helps us to cast off the natural man, who is selfish, defensive, prideful, and jealous. Charity is the principal characteristic of a true follower of Jesus Christ.Charity defines a peacemaker."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,24,"When we humble ourselves before God and pray withallthe energy of our hearts, God will grant us charity."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,25,Those blessed with this supernal gift are long-suffering and kind. They do not envy others and are not caught up in their own importance. They arenot easily provoked and do not think evil of others.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,26,"Brothers and sisters, the pure love of Christ is the answer to the contention that ails us today. Charity propels us “to bear one another’s burdens”rather than heap burdens upon each other. The pure love of Christ allows us “to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things”—especiallyin tense situations. Charity allows us to demonstrate how men and women of Christ speak and act—especiallywhen under fire."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,27,"Now, I am not talking about “peace at any price.”I am talking about treating others in ways that are consistent with keeping the covenant you make when you partake of the sacrament. You covenant toalwaysremember the Savior. In situations that are highly charged and filled with contention, I invite you to remember Jesus Christ. Pray to have the courage and wisdom to say or do what He would. As we follow the Prince of Peace, we will become His peacemakers."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,28,At this point you may be thinking that this message would really help someone you know. Perhaps you are hoping that it will help him or her to be nicer to you. I hope it will! But I also hope that you will look deeply intoyourheart to see if there are shards of pride or jealousy that preventyoufrom becoming a peacemaker.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,29,"If you are serious about helping to gather Israel and about building relationships that will last throughout the eternities,nowis the time to lay aside bitterness.Nowis the time to cease insisting that it is your way or no way.Nowis the time to stop doing things that make others walk on eggshells for fear of upsetting you.Nowis the time to bury your weapons of war.If your verbal arsenal is filled with insults and accusations,nowis the time to put them away.You will arise as a spiritually strong man or woman of Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,30,"The temple can help us in our quest. There we are endowed with God’s power, giving us the ability to overcome Satan, the instigator ofallcontention.Cast him out of your relationships! Note that we also rebuke the adversary every time we heal a misunderstanding or refuse to take offense. Instead, we can show the tender mercy that is characteristic of true disciples of Jesus Christ. Peacemakers thwart the adversary."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,31,"Let us as a people become a true light on the hill—a light that “cannot be hid.”Let us show that there is a peaceful, respectful way to resolve complex issues and an enlightened way to work out disagreements. As you demonstrate the charity that true followers of Jesus Christ manifest, the Lord will magnify your efforts beyond your loftiest imagination."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,32,"The gospel net is the largest net in the world.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,33,"My dear brothers and sisters, the best is yet to come for those who spend their lives building up others. Today I invite you to examine your discipleship within the context of the way you treat others. I bless you to make any adjustments that may be needed so that your behavior is ennobling, respectful, and representative of a true follower of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson,President Russell M. Nelson,34,"I bless you to replace belligerence with beseeching, animosity with understanding, and contention with peace."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,5,I love Him. I believe Him. I testify that He is the Resurrection and the Life.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,6,"This testimony has comforted and strengthened me during the past four and a half years since my wife, Barbara, passed away. I miss her."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,7,"Often, I have been reflecting on our eternal marriage and our life together."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,8,"I previously have shared how I first met Barbara and how that experience taught me to use the skill of “following up” that I had learned on my mission. I had to follow up quickly with her after we first met because she wasbeautiful, popular, and had a very busy social calendar. I was smitten early because she was approachable and friendly. I admired her goodness. I felt that she and I belonged together. It seemed that simple in my mind."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,9,"Barbara and I dated, and our relationship began to grow, but she was uncertain that marriage to me was right for her."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,10,"It wasn’t enough for me to know; Barbara needed to know for herself. I knew if we spent time fasting and praying about the matter, Barbara could receive a confirmation from heaven."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,11,"We spent a weekend without dating so we could fast and pray individually to know for ourselves. Fortunately for me, she received the same confirmation that I did. The rest, as they say, is history."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,12,"When Barbara passed away, our children put on her headstone several lessons that Barbara wanted them to remember. One of those lessons is “what matters most is what lasts longest.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,13,Today I will share from my heart a few feelings and thoughts on what matters most.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,14,"First, a relationship with our Heavenly Father and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is most important. This relationship matters most now and in eternity."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,15,"Second, family relationships are among those things that matter most."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,16,"Throughout my ministry, I have visited many individuals and families impacted by devastating natural disasters. Many were displaced, hungry, and frightened. They needed medical assistance, food, and shelter."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,17,They also needed their families.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,18,"I recognize some may not have the blessings of a close family, so I include extended family, friends, and even ward families as “family.” These relationships are essential for emotional and physical health."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,19,"These relationships can also offer love, joy, happiness, and a sense of belonging."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,20,"Nurturing these important relationships is a choice. A choice to be part of a family requires commitment, love, patience, communication, and forgiveness.There may be times when we disagree with another person, but we can do so without being disagreeable. In courtship and marriage, we don’t fall in love or fall out of love as though we are objects being moved on a chessboard. We choose to love and sustain one another. We do the same in other family relationships and with friends who are like family to us."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,21,The family proclamation states that “the divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.”
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,22,"Another thing that matters most is following the promptings of the Spirit in our most important relationships and in our efforts to love our neighbors as ourselves, including in our private and public ministries. I learned this lesson early in my life while serving as a bishop."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,23,"Late one cold, snowy winter evening, I was leaving my bishop’s office when I had a strong impression to visit an elderly widow in the ward. I glanced at my watch—it was 10:00 p.m. I reasoned that it was too late to make such a visit. And besides, it was snowing. I decided to visit this dear sister first thing in the morning rather than disturbing her at such a late hour. I drove home and went to bed but tossed and turned throughout the night because the Spirit was stirring me."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,24,"Early the next morning, I drove straight to the widow’s home. Her daughter answered the door and tearfully said, “Oh, Bishop, thank you for coming. Mother passed awaytwo hours ago”—I was devastated. I will never forget the feelings of my heart. I wept. Who more than this dear widow deserved to have her bishop hold her hand, comfort her, and perhaps give her a final blessing? I missed that opportunity because I reasoned away this strong prompting from the Spirit."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,25,"Brothers and sisters, young men and young women, and Primary children, I testify that following the promptings of the Spirit is one of the things that matter most in all our relationships."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,26,"Finally, on this Palm Sunday weekend, I testify that being converted to the Lord, bearing testimony of Him, and serving Him are also among the things that matter most."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,27,"Faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of our testimonies. A testimony is a witness or confirmation of eternal truth impressed upon individual hearts and souls through the Holy Ghost. A testimony of Jesus Christ, born of and strengthened by the Spirit, changes lives—it changes the way we think and how we live. A testimony turns us toward our Heavenly Father and His divine Son."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,28,"Alma taught:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,29,"“Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,30,"“Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,31,"Having a testimony alone is not enough. As our conversion to Jesus Christ grows, we naturally want to testify of Him—His goodness, love, and kindness."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,32,"Often in our testimony meetings on fast Sundays, we hear the phrases “I am thankful” and “I love” more than we hear the phrases “I know” and “I believe.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,33,"I invite you to bear your testimony of Jesus Christ more often. Bear testimony of what youknowandbelieveand what youfeel, not just of what you are thankful for. Testify of your own experiences of coming to know and love the Savior, of living His teachings, and of His redemptive and enabling power in your life. As you bear testimony of what youknow,believe, andfeel, the Holy Ghost will confirm the truth to those who earnestly listen to your testimony. They will do so because they have watched you become a peaceful follower of Jesus Christ. They will see what it means to be His disciple. They will also feel something they may not have felt before. A pure testimony comes from a changed heart andcan be carried by the power of the Holy Ghostinto the hearts of others who are open to receive it."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,34,Those who feel something as a result of your testimony may then ask the Lord in prayer to confirm the truth of your testimony. Then they can know for themselves.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,35,"Brothers and sisters, I testify and witness to you that I know that Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of the world. He lives. He is the resurrected Son of God, and this is His Church, led by His prophet and apostles. I pray that someday when I pass to the next world, I may do so with my testimony burning brightly."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard,President M. Russell Ballard,36,"In my ministry, I have learned what matters most is our relationships with Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, our families, and our neighbors, and allowing the Spirit of the Lord to guide us in those relationships so we can testify of the things that matter most and last longest. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,5,"What began with the heralding of Jesus as the promised Messiah in His triumphant entry into Jerusalem closed with His Crucifixion and Resurrection.By divine design, His atoning sacrifice concluded His mortal ministry, making it possible for us to live with our Heavenly Father for eternity."

Meeting with these Saints, I felt their profound love and devotion to the Lord. I expressed my great love for them and that the President of the Church loved them. I referred to the Savior’s words recorded by John: “That ye love one another, as I have loved you.”They deemed it the “I love you conference.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,9,"As I looked up and down the rows of those dear brothers and sisters and their families in the chapel, I could see in their faces the glow of testimony and faith in Jesus Christ. I felt their desire to be counted as part of His far-reaching Church. And when the choir sang, they sang like angels."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,10,"Like on Palm Sunday of old, these were disciples of Jesus Christ gathered to pay tribute to Him as did those at the gates of Jerusalem who, with palms in their hands, exclaimed, “Hosanna … : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,11,"Even the parishioners in a church nearby were honoring Palm Sunday. As I was speaking from the pulpit, I noticed out the window they were joyfully walking down the street waving palms in their hands, much like those in this photo. It was a sight I will never forget—all of us that day worshipping the King of kings."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,12,"President Russell M. Nelson has admonished us to make Palm Sunday “truly holy by remembering, not just the palms that were waved to honor the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, but by remembering the palms of His hands.” Then President Nelson referred to Isaiah, who spoke of the Savior’s promising, “I will never forget you,” with these words: “Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,13,"The Lord knows firsthand that mortality is hard. His wounds remind us that He “descended below … all”that He might succor us when we suffer and be our example to “hold on thy way,”His way, that “God shall be with [us] forever and ever.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,14,"Palm Sunday was not just anevent, another page in history with a date, time, and place. Jesus Christ’s triumphant entry into Jerusalem and the events of the week that followed exemplify doctrine we can apply in our lives today."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,15,Let us look at some of the eternal doctrine that weaves through His ministry concluding in Jerusalem.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,16,"First, prophecy. For example, Old Testament prophet Zechariah prophesied of Jesus Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, even describing He would ride on a donkey.Jesus foretold His Resurrection as He prepared to enter the city, saying:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,17,"“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,18,"“And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,19,"Second, the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith taught, “No man can know that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.”The Savior promised His disciplesat the Last Supperin the upper room,“I will not leave you comfortless.”They would not be alone to carry the truths of the gospel forward but would have the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost to guide them. “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,” He promised; “not as the world giveth, give I unto you.”With the gift of the Holy Ghost, we have that same assurance—that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]”and “by the power of the Holy Ghost [we] may know the truth of all things.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,20,"Third, discipleship. True discipleship is unfailing commitment, obedience to eternal laws, and love of God, first and foremost. Nothing wavering. The multitude who paid tribute with palms hailed Him as the Messiah. That was exactly who He was. They were drawn to Him, His miracles, and His teachings. But the adulation for many did not last. Some who earlier had shouted, “Hosanna,”soon turned and cried, “Crucify him.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,21,"Fourth, the Atonement of Jesus Christ.In His final days, following Palm Sunday, He carried out His remarkable Atonement, from the agony of Gethsemane to the mockery of His trial, His torture on the cross, and His burial in a borrowed tomb. But it did not stop there. With the majesty of His calling as the Redeemer of all of Heavenly Father’s children, three days later He stepped forth from that tomb, resurrected,as He had prophesied."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,22,"Are we continually grateful for the incomparable Atonement of Jesus Christ? Do we feel its purifying power, right now? That is why Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of our salvation, went to Jerusalem, to save us all. Do these words in Alma strikea chord: “If ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?”I can truly say, the choir in Takoradi that Palm Sunday sang “the song of redeeming love.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,23,"That last fateful week of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ gave the parable of the ten virgins.He was teaching of His return to those prepared to receive Him, not with palms in their hands but with the light of the gospel within them. He used the image of lamps lit and burning, with extra oil to fuel the flame, as a description of a willingness to live His ways, embrace His truths, and share His light."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,24,"You know the story. The ten virgins represent members of the Church, and the bridegroom represents Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,25,"The ten virgins took their lamps and “went forth to meet the bridegroom.”Five were wise, prepared with oil in their lamps and some to spare, and five were foolish, lamps dark with no oil in reserve. When the call came, “Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him,”the five who were “wise and [had] received the truth, and [had] taken the Holy Spirit for their guide”were ready for “their king and their lawgiver,”that “his glory [would] be upon them.”The other five were frantically trying to find oil. But it was too late. The procession went forward without them. When they knocked and pleaded for entrance, the Lord responded, “I know you not.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,26,"How would we feel if He said to us, “I know you not!”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,27,"We, like the ten virgins, have lamps; but do we have oil? I fear there are some who are just getting by on a thin skiff of oil, too busy with worldlypressures to properly prepare. Oil comes from believing and acting on prophecy and the words of living prophets, President Nelson in particular, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles. Oil fills our souls when we hear and feel the Holy Ghost and act on that divine guidance. Oil pours into our hearts when our choices show we love the Lord and we love what He loves. Oil comes from repenting and seeking the healing of the Atonement of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,28,"If some of you are looking to fill what some call “a bucket list,” this is it: fill your bucket with oil in the form of the living water of Jesus Christ,which is a representation of His life and teachings. In contrast, checking off a far-off place or a spectacular event will never leave your soul feeling whole or satisfied; living the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ will. I mentioned examples earlier: embrace prophecy and prophetic teachings, act on promptings of the Holy Ghost, become a true disciple, and seek the healing power of our Lord’s Atonement. That bucket list will take you somewhere you want to go—back to your Father in Heaven."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,29,"That Palm Sunday in Takoradi was a very special experience for me because I shared it with a faithful congregation of brothers and sisters. So it has been on continents and islands all around the world. My heart and soul, like yours, longs to shout, “Hosanna to the Most High God.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,30,"Though we do not stand at the gates of Jerusalem today with palms in our hands, the time will come when, as prophesied in Revelation, “a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, [will stand] before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,31,"I leave with you my blessing as an Apostle of Jesus Christ that you will diligently strive to live righteously and be among those who, with palms in their hands, will herald the Son of God, the great Redeemer of us all. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,33,"All four of the Gospels—Matthew 21–28;Mark 11–16;Luke 19–24; andJohn 12–21—describe the last days of Jesus Christ’s ministry in mortality, which was divinely designed to make the blessings of salvation and exaltation available to all of God’s children.

In December 1838 the Prophet Joseph and a handful of other Church leaders were unjustly imprisoned in Liberty Jail. The conditions were dreadful. After months in wretched circumstances, he wrote to the members in March of 1839, including prayers where he had petitioned the Lord to have compassion on his situation and the “suffering saints.” He also shared the Lord’s response to those prayers as recorded inDoctrine and Covenants 121–23."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,42,"Doctrine and Covenants 122:9. The Lord’s encouragement to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail brought him comfort and spiritual understanding that adversity and trials can strengthen us, teach patience, and foster self-mastery.

They knew Him to be the Christ, the Son of the living God; and how could such a One be brought into subjection and be slain?” ([1916], 502–3)."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/53rasband,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,49,"The specific day/night in which Jesus instituted the sacrament in the “upper room” is actually disputed because of seeming discrepancies between Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Matthew, Mark, and Luke suggest that the Last Supper took place on “the first day of the feast of unleavened bread,” or the Passover meal (seeMatthew 26:17;Mark 14:12;Luke 22:1, 7). John, however, suggests that Jesus was arrested before the Passover meal (seeJohn 18:28), meaning that the Last Supper would have taken place one day earlier than the Passover meal. The Church’s curriculum materials and Latter-day Saint scholarship seem to agree that Jesus held the Last Supper with His disciples in the upper room on the evening before He was crucified. Christians who celebrate Holy Week recognize Thursday as the day of the Last Supper, Friday as the day of the Crucifixion, and Sunday as the day of Resurrection—according to the Gregorian calendar."

When the Father said, “Whom shall I send?” Jesus Christ stepped forward: “Here am I, send me” (Abraham 3:27). President Russell M. Nelson has taught: “[Jesus Christ’s] mission was the Atonement. That mission was uniquely His. Born of a mortal mother and an immortal Father, He was the only one who could voluntarily lay down His life and take it up again (seeJohn 10:14–18). The glorious consequences of His Atonement were infinite and eternal. He took the sting out of death and made temporary the grief of the grave (see1 Corinthians 15:54–55). His responsibility for the Atonement was known even before the Creation and the Fall. Not only was it to provide for the resurrection and immortality of all humankind, but it was also to enable us to be forgiven of our sins—upon conditions established by Him. Thus His Atonement opened the way by which we could be united with Him and with our families eternally” (“The Mission and Ministry of Jesus Christ,”Ensign, Apr. 2013, 34;Liahona, Apr. 2013, 20)."

My favorite season was fall—the time of the harvest. Our family hoped and prayed that our months of hard work would be rewarded with a bountiful harvest. My parents worried over the weather, the health of animals and crops, and many other things over which they had little control."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,5,"As I grew, I became even more aware of the urgency involved. Our livelihood depended upon the harvest. My father taught me about the equipment we used to harvest grain. I watched as he would move the machinery into the field, cut a small swath of grain, and then check behind the combine to make sure that as much grain as possible landed in the holding tank and was not thrown out with the chaff. He repeated this exercise several times, adjusting the machine each time. I ran alongside and pawed through the chaff with him and pretended that I knew what I was doing."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,6,"After he was satisfied with the adjustments to the machine, I found some kernels of grain in the chaff on the ground and presented them to him with a critical look. I will not forget what my father said to me: “It is good enough and the best that this machine can do.” Not really satisfied with his explanation, I pondered the imperfections of this harvest."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,7,"A short time later, when the weather turned cold in the evenings, I watched thousands of migrating swans, geese, and ducks descend onto the fields to nourish themselves on their long journey south. They ate the leftover grain from our imperfect harvest. God had perfected it. And not a kernel was lost."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,8,"It is often a temptation in our world and even within the culture of the Church to obsess about perfection. Social media, unrealistic expectations, and often our own self-criticism create feelings of inadequacy—that we are not good enough and never will be. Some even misunderstand the invitation of the Savior to “be ye therefore perfect.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,9,"Remember that perfectionism is not the same as being perfected in Christ.Perfectionism requires an impossible, self-inflicted standard that compares us to others. This causes guilt and anxiety and can make us want to withdraw and isolate ourselves."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,10,"Becoming perfected in Christ is another matter. It is the process—lovingly guided by the Holy Ghost—of becoming more like the Savior. The standards are set by a kind and all-knowing Heavenly Father and clearly defined in the covenants we are invited to embrace. It relieves us of the burdens of guilt and inadequacy, always emphasizing who we are in the sight of God. While this process lifts us and pushes us to become better, we are measured by our personal devotion to God that we manifest in our efforts to follow Him in faith. As we accept theSavior’s invitation to come unto Him, we soon realize that our best is good enough and that the grace of a loving Savior will make up the difference in ways we cannot imagine."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,26,"Brothers and sisters, that may not have been the end of the conversation. I believe that as Peter and the Savior walked back to the ship arm in arm, Peter soaking wet and perhaps feeling very foolish, the Savior may have said something like this: “Oh, Peter, fear not and worry not. If you could see yourself as I see you, your doubt would fade and your faith increase. I love you, dear Peter; you got out of the boat. Your offering is acceptable, and even though you faltered, I will always be there to lift you from the depths, and your offering will be made perfect.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,27,"Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,28,"“I believe the Savior Jesus Christ would want you to see, feel, and know that He is your strength. That with His help, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. That your potential is limitless. He would want you to see yourself the way He sees you. And that is very different from the way the world sees you. …"

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,30,"We must remember that whatever our best-but-imperfect offering is, the Savior can make it perfect. No matter how insignificant our efforts may seem, we must never underestimate the Savior’s power. A simple word of kindness, a brief but sincere ministering visit, or a Primary lesson lovingly taught can, with the Savior’s help, provide comfort, soften hearts, and change eternal lives. Our clumsy efforts can lead to miracles, and in the process, we can participate in a perfect harvest."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,31,"Often we are placed in situations that will cause us to stretch. We may not feel up to the task. We may look at those we serve with and feel that wewill never measure up. Brothers and sisters, if you feel this way, look at the extraordinary men and women seated behind me with whom I serve."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,32,I feel your pain.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,33,"I have learned, however, that just as perfectionism is not the same as being perfected in Christ, self-comparison is not the same as emulation. When we compare ourselves to others, there can be only two results. Either we will see ourselves as better than others and become judgmental and critical of them, or we will see ourselves as less than others and become anxious, self-critical, and discouraged. Comparing ourselves to others is rarely productive, not uplifting, and sometimes downright depressing. In fact, these comparisons can be spiritually destructive, preventing us from receiving the spiritual help we need. On the other hand, emulating those we respect who demonstrate Christlike attributes can be instructive and uplifting and can help us become better disciples of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,34,"The Savior gave us a model to follow as He emulated the Father. He instructed His disciple Philip: “Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,35,"And then He taught, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,36,"Regardless of how insignificant our efforts may seem, if we are sincere, the Savior will use us to accomplish His work. If we simply do the best we can and trust Him to make up the difference, we can become part of the miracles that surround us."

With Christ, there is no imperfect harvest. We must have the courage to believe that His grace is for us—that He will help us, rescue us from the depths when we falter, and perfect our less-than-perfect efforts."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/54stanfill,Elder Vern P. Stanfill,40,"In the parable of the sower, the Savior describes the seeds that are planted in good ground. Some produce a hundredfold, some sixty, and others thirty. All are part of His perfect harvest."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,4,"As we have been reminded this morning, today is Palm Sunday, marking the Savior’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem and the beginning of that holy week preceding His great Atonement, which would include His suffering, Crucifixion, and Resurrection."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,5,"Not long before His prophesied entry into the city, Jesus Christ was fully engaged in His ministry when He received word from His dear friends Mary and Martha that their brother Lazarus was sick."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,6,"Although Lazarus’s illness was serious, the Lord “abode two days still in the same place where he was. Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.”Before beginning the journey to His friends’ home in Bethany, “said Jesus unto [His disciples] plainly, Lazarus is dead.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,7,"When Jesus came into Bethany and met first Martha and then Mary, perhaps out of frustration for His late arrival, they each greeted Him saying, “Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.”Martha further exclaimed, “By this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,8,"These four days were significant to Mary and Martha. According to some rabbinic schools of thought, it was believed that the spirit of someone who died would remain with the body for three days, offering hope that life was still possible. However, by the fourth day that hope was lost, perhaps because the body would begin to decay and “stinketh.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,9,"Mary and Martha were in a state of despair. “When Jesus therefore saw [Mary] weeping, … he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,10,"“And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,11,"It is at this moment that we see one of the great miracles during the Savior’s mortal ministry. First the Lord said, “Take ye away the stone.”Then, after thanking His Father, “he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,12,"“And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,13,"Like Mary and Martha, we have the opportunity to experience all of mortality, even sorrowand weakness.Each of us will experience the heartache that accompanies the loss of someone we love. Our mortal journey might include personal illness or the debilitating illness of a loved one; depression, anxiety, or other mental health challenges; financial hardship; betrayal; sin. And sometimes these are accompanied by feelings of hopelessness. I am no different. Like you, I have experienced a myriad of challenges that are expected in this life. I am drawn to this account about the Savior and what it teaches me about our relationship with Him."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,14,"During our greatest worries, we, like Mary and Martha, seek the Savioror ask the Father for His divine intervention. The story of Lazarus teaches us principles that can be applied to our own lives as we face our individual challenges."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,15,"When the Savior arrived in Bethany, all had lost hope that Lazarus could be saved—it had been four days, and he was gone. Sometimes during our own challenges, we might feel like Christ is too late, and our hope and faith might even feel challenged. My witness and testimony are that as we move forward with faith in Jesus Christ, the fourth day will always come. He will always come to our aid or to raise our hopes back to life. He has promised:"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,16,“Let not your heart be troubled.”
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,17,"“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,18,"Sometimes it may seem like He doesn’t come to us until the figurative fourth day, after all hope seems lost. But why so late? President Thomas S. Monson taught, “Our Heavenly Father, who gives us so much to delight in, also knows that we learn and grow and become stronger as we face and survive the trials through which we must pass.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,19,"Even the Prophet Joseph Smith faced an enormous fourth-day experience. Remember his pleading? “O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?”As we trust in Him, we can expect a like answer: “My son [or daughter], peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,20,"Another message we can learn from the story of Lazarus is what our own role might be in the divine intervention we seek. When Jesus approached the tomb, Hefirstsaid to those who were there, “Take ye away the stone.”With the power that the Savior had, could notHehave miraculously moved the stone without effort? This would have been impressive to see and an unforgettable experience, yet He said to the others, “Take ye away the stone.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,21,"Second, the Lord “cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.”Wouldn’t it have been more impressive if the Lord had Himself miraculously placed Lazarus at the opening so he would be immediately visible to the crowd when the stone was removed?"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,22,"Third, when Lazarus did come forth, he was “bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.”I’m sure the Lord was capable of having Lazarus standing at the opening, already clean and approachable, with his graveclothes nicely folded."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,23,"What is the point of highlighting these aspects? Each of these three things had something in common—none required the use of Christ’s divine power. That which His disciples could do, He instructedthemto do. The disciples were certainly capable of moving the stone themselves; Lazarus, after being raised, had the capacity to stand and present himself at the opening of the cave; and those who loved Lazarus could absolutely help him remove the graveclothes."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,24,"However, it was only the Christ who had the power and authority to raise Lazarus from the dead. My impression is that the Savior expects us to do all we can do, and He will do whatonly Hecan do."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,25,"We know that “faith [in the Lord Jesus Christ] is a principle of action”and “miracles do not produce faith, but strong faith is developed by obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. In other words, faith comes by righteousness.”As we strive to act righteously by making and keeping sacred covenants and applying the doctrine of Christ in our lives, our faith will not only be sufficient to carry us to the fourth day, but with the Lord’s help we will also be capable of moving stones that are in our path,arising from despair, and loosening ourselves of all that binds us. While the Lord expects us to “do all things that lie in our power,”remember that He will provide needed help in all these things as we trust in Him."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,26,How can we move stones and build upon His rock?We can abide by thecounselof prophets.
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,27,"For example, last October, President Russell M. Nelson pleaded with us to take charge of our own testimonies of the Savior and His gospel, to work for them and nurture them, to feed them truth, and to avoid polluting them with false philosophies of unbelievers. He promised each of us, “As you make the continual strengthening of your testimony of Jesus Christ your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,28,We can do this!
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,29,"How can we figuratively arise and come forth? We can joyfully repent and choose to obeycommandments. The Lord said, “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”We can strive to repent daily and joyfully move forward with a willing heart full of love for the Lord."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,30,We can do this!
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/55bassett,Elder W. Mark Bassett,31,"How can we, with the Lord’s help, loose ourselves of all that binds us? We can intentionally bind ourselves first and foremost to our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, throughcovenants. Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught: “What is the source of [our] moral and spiritual power, and how do we obtain it? The source is God. Our access to that power is through our covenants with Him. … In these divine agreements, God binds Himself to sustain, sanctify, and exalt us in return for our commitment to serve Him and keep His commandments.”We can make and keep sacred covenants."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,4,"One evening after work, years ago, I boarded my usual bus home to New Jersey from New York City. The woman I happened to sit next to noticed what I was writing on my computer and asked, “You believe in … Christ?” I said, “Yes, I do!” As we talked, I learned she had just moved to the area from her beautiful Asian country to work in New York’s highly competitive information technology sector."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,5,"Naturally, I asked her, “Do you know why I as a Christian believe in Jesus Christ?” She too responded normally and invited me to tell her. But as I went to speak, I had one of those moments where many thoughts flood your mind. This was the first time I would explain the “why” of Christianity to someone very unfamiliar with it and highly intelligent. I couldn’t simply say, “I follow Jesus Christ because He willingly suffered and died for my sins.” She might wonder, “Did Jesus have to die? Couldn’t God simply forgive and cleanse us of our sins if we asked Him to?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,6,"How would you have responded in a few minutes? How would you explain this to a friend? Children and youth: would you please ask your parents or a leader later on, “Why did Jesus have to die?” And, brothers and sisters, I have a confession to make: despite all I thought I knew about Church doctrine, history, policy, and so on, the answer to this central question to our faith did not come so easily. That day I decided to focus more on what matters most to eternal life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,7,"Well, I informed my new friendthat we have a spirit in addition to a body and that God is the Father of our spirits.I told her we lived with our Heavenly Father before our births into this mortal world.Because He loves her and all His children, He made a plan for us to receive a body in the image of His glorified body,be part of a family,and return to His loving presence to enjoy eternal life with our familieslike He does with His.But, I said, we would face two main obstacles in this necessarily fallen world:(1) physical death—the separation of our bodies from our spirits. Of course, she knew we would all die. And (2) spiritual death—ourseparation from God because our sins, mistakes, and flaws as mortals distance us from His holy presence.She related to this too."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,8,"I informed her that this was an effect of the law of justice. Thiseternal lawdemands that aneternal penaltybe paid for every one of our sins, or violations of God’s laws or truth, or we couldneverreturn to live in His holy presence.It would be unjust, and God “cannot deny justice.”She understood this but easily grasped that God is also merciful, loving, and eager to bring to pass our eternal life.I informed my friend that we would also have a cunning, powerful adversary—the source of evil and lies—opposing us.Therefore, someone withinfinitegodly power to overcome all such opposition and obstacles would need to save us."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,9,"I then shared with her the good news—the “good tidings of great joy … to all people”—that “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”I testified to my friend, and I witness to you, that Jesus Christ is that Savior, that Hehadto suffer, die, and rise again—HisinfiniteAtonement—to redeem all humanity from physical deathand to give eternal life with God and our familiestoallwho would follow Him. The Book of Mormon declares, “Thus God … gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men … ; being filled with [mercy and] compassion … ; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,10,"The steps God revealed we must take to follow Jesus and receive eternal life are called the doctrine of Christ. They include “faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism [into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints], receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.”I shared these steps with my friend, but here are some ways in which prophets and apostles have recently taught how the doctrine of Christ can bless all God’s children."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,11,"President Russell M. Nelson instructed: “The pure doctrine of Christ is powerful. It changes the life ofeveryonewho understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,12,"Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught, “[The]For the Strength of Youth[guide] is bold in declaring the doctrine of … Christ [and] inviting you [youth] to make choices based on [it].”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,13,"Elder Dale G. Renlund taught, “We invitemissionariesto do what they ask those they teach to do: … apply the doctrine of Christ in their lives [and] get on and stay on the covenant path.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,14,"The doctrine of Christ empowers those who arestruggling or feel they don’t belong in the Churchbecause it helps them, as Elder D. Todd Christofferson stated, “affirm: Jesus Christ died for me … [and] loves me.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,15,"Parents, if your child struggles with a gospel principle or prophetic teaching,pleaseresist any type of evil speakingor activism toward the Church or its leaders. These lesser, secular approaches are beneath you and can be lethal to the long-term faithfulness of your child.It speaks so well of you that you would protect or advocate for your precious child or show signs of solidarity with him or her. But my wife, Jayne, and I know from personal experience that teaching your beloved child why we all desperately need Jesus Christ and how to apply His joyful doctrine is what willstrengthen and heal him or her. Let us turn them to Jesus, who istheir true advocatewith the Father. The Apostle John taught, “Whosoever … abideth in the doctrine of Christ … hath both the Father and the Son.” He then warns us to beware “if there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,16,"Jayne and I recently visited the wilderness where Moses held up a serpent of brass before the wandering children of Israel. The Lord had promised to heal all who were bitten by poisonous snakes if they would simply look upon it.In holding up the doctrine of Christ before us, the Lord’s prophet is doing the same, “that he should heal the nations.”Whatever the bites or poison or struggles we experience in this mortal wilderness, let us not be as those who, anciently and presently, could have been healed but, sadly, “would not look … because they did not believe that it would heal them.”The Book of Mormon affirms: “Behold, … this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine of Christ.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,17,"That evening in New Jersey, sharing why we need Jesus Christ and His doctrine gave me a new sister and her a new brother. We felt the peaceful, confirming witness of the Holy Ghost. Naturally, I invited her to share her contact information and continue the conversation with our missionaries. She was happy to do so."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,18,"“Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth,” the Book of Mormon declares—to love, share, and inviteas we gather Israel in all our communitiesand families—“that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace [and doctrine] of the Holy Messiah.”In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Corbitt,24,"The Father’s perfect plan—called the great plan of happiness, the plan of salvation, and the plan of redemption, among other references—is organized such that everyone who comes into mortality necessarily does so into a family, and everyone is part of a family. Of course, not all family circumstances are ideal or accord with our Father’s loving vision for all His children, and some circumstances are tragic. However, as we live the doctrine of Christ, Jesus Christ helps us receive all the blessings the Father has for His children through His merciful and comprehensive plan. See also endnote 6."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/56corbitt,Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt,25,"One of the greatest promises God has made to His children is also the greatest of all His gifts to us: exaltation, or eternal life, which is to live eternally “in God’s presence and to continue as families” (Gospel Topics, “Eternal Life,” topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see alsoDoctrine and Covenants 14:7). “Families” include husband, wife, and children, as well as our living and deceased relatives who accept and live the doctrine of Christ. Already-deceased family members in the spirit world who were not able to embrace the doctrine of Christ in this life can do so in the spirit world as ordinances like baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and others that help us endure to the end are lovingly performed vicariously by living relatives in temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Additionally, the promise of eternal life is not just to those who are married in this life. President M. Russell Ballard taught, “Scriptures and latter-day prophets confirm thateveryonewho is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation” (“Hope in Christ,”Liahona, May 2021, 55; emphasis added). Citing President Russell M. Nelson and President Dallin H. Oaks, President Ballard continued, “The precise time and manner in which the blessings of exaltation are bestowed have not all been revealed, but they are nonethelessassured” (“Hope in Christ,” 55; emphasis added). President Nelson taught: “In the Lord’s own way and time, no [blessing] will be withheld from His faithful Saints. The Lord will judge and reward each individual according to heartfelt desire as well as deed” (“Celestial Marriage,”EnsignorLiahona, Nov. 2008, 94). And President Oaks explained, “Many of the most important deprivations of mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan of happiness for all of our Father’s worthy children” (“The Great Plan of Happiness,”Ensign, Nov. 1993, 75).

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,7,"Please notice that at the time of Enoch’s call to serve, he became acutely aware of his personal inadequacies and limitations. And I suspect all of us at one time or another in our Church service have felt much like Enoch. But I believe the Lord’s response to Enoch’s pleading question is instructive and applies to each of us today."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,8,"“And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance. …"

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,12,The Lord Jesus Christ extends to each of us the invitation to abide in Him.But how do we actually learn and come to abide in Him?
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,13,"The wordabidedenotes remaining fixed or stable and enduring without yielding. Elder Jeffrey R.

Come with conviction and endurance. Come permanently, for your sake and the sake of all the generations who must follow you.”Thus, we abide in Christ as we are firm and steadfast inour devotion to the Redeemer and His holy purposes, in times both good and bad."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,15,"We abide in Him by striving continually to strengthen our individual covenant bond with the Father and the Son.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,16,"We abide in Him by truly feasting upon the words of Christ. The Savior’s doctrine draws us, as children of the covenant, closer to Himand will tell us all things what we should do."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,17,"We abide in Him by preparing earnestly to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament, reviewing and reflecting on our covenant promises, and repenting sincerely.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,21,"The Savior’s promise to His followers is twofold: if we abide in Him, He will abide in us.

Bednar,22,"In the Book of Mormon, we learn about Alma’s teaching and testifying to the poor whose afflictions had compelled them to be humble. In his instruction, he compared the word to a seed that must be planted and nourished, and he described “the word” as the life, mission, and atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,23,"Alma said, “Begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day, according to their works.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,24,"Given this description of “the word” by Alma, please consider the inspiring connection he then identifies."

And even all this can ye do if ye will.”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,26,"The seed we should strive to plant in our hearts is the word—even the life, mission, and doctrine of Jesus Christ. And as the word is nourished by faith, it can become a tree springing upin usunto everlasting life."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,27,What was the symbolism of the tree in Lehi’s vision? The tree can be considered as a representation of Jesus Christ.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,29,"Perhaps this miraculous potential inspired Alma to ask: “Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?”"
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A.

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,43,"I emphasize the absolute comprehensiveness of the Savior’s plea. He yearns to bless with His grace and mercy every single person who now lives, who has ever lived, and who will yet live upon the earth."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,44,"Some Church members accept as true the doctrine, principles, and testimonies proclaimed repeatedly from this pulpit in the Conference Center and in local congregations around the world—and yet may struggle to believe these eternal truths apply specifically in their lives and to their circumstances. They believe sincerely and serve dutifully, but their covenant connection with the Father and His redeeming Son has not yet become a living and transforming reality in their lives."
  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,45,"I promise that by the power of the Holy Ghost, you can know and feel the gospel truths I have attempted to describe are for you—for you individually and personally."

  2023,"04",/general-conference/2023/04/57bednar,Elder David A. Bednar,68,"“Interestingly, a good seed becomes a tree as it is planted in the heart and begins to swell, sprout, and grow."
