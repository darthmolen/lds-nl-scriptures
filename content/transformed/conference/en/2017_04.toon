  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,4,"I speak to you, the rising generation—youth and young adults, single or married—you who are the future leaders of this, the Lord’s Church. With all the wickedness, chaos, fear, and confusion in the world today, I speak to you with clarity about the majesty and blessing of coming to know God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,5,Jesus Christ taught many truths that explain Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness and your place in it. I’ll focus on two of these to help you understand youridentityas a child of God and know yourpurposein life.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,6,"First: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,7,"Second: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,8,Please keep these truths in mind—they teachwhy—as I seek to describehowyou and all of us can come to know God.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,9,"My young friends, we can begin to know God through prayer."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,10,"On April 7, 1829, 22-year-old Oliver Cowdery began his labors as scribe for 23-year-old Joseph Smith. They were young—just like you. Oliver asked for a confirmation from God regarding the Restoration and his work in it. In response, he received the following revelation:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,11,"“Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me and I did enlighten thy mind. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,12,"“Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts and the intents of thy heart. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,13,"“… If you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,14,“Did I not speak peace to your mind … ? What greater witness can you have than from God?”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,15,"Whenyoupray with faith, you will feel God’s love as His Spirit speaks toyoursoul. No matter how alone or uncertain you may feel at times, you are not alone in this world. God knowsyou,personally. As you pray, you will come to knowHim."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,16,"As you study the scriptures, you not only learnaboutthe Savior, but you can actually come toknowthe Savior."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,17,"In April 1985, Elder Bruce R. McConkie spoke in general conference—just 13 days before he died. He concluded with this testimony:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,18,"“I am one of his witnesses, and in a coming day I shall feel the nail marks in his hands and in his feet and shall wet his feet with my tears."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,19,"“But I shall notknowany better then than Iknownow that he is God’s Almighty Son, that he is our Savior and Redeemer, and that salvation comes in and through his atoning blood and in no other way.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,20,"Those of us who heard Elder McConkie speak that day have neverforgotten how we felt. As he began his talk, he revealedwhyhis witness was so powerful. He said:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,21,"“In speaking of these wondrous things I shall use my own words, though you may think they are the words of scripture. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,22,"“True it is they were first proclaimed by others, butthey are now mine,for the Holy Spirit of God has borne witness to me that they are true, and it is now as though the Lord had revealed them to me in the first instance. I have therebyheardhis voice andknowhis word.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,23,"As you study and ponder the scriptures, you too will hear God’s voice, know His words, and come to know Him. God will reveal His eternal truths to you, personally. These doctrines and principles will become part of who you are and will emanate from your very soul."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,24,"In addition to individual study, studying the scriptures as a family is important."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,25,In our home we wanted our children to learn to recognize the voice of the Spirit. We believe that happened as we studied the Book of Mormon each day as a family. Our testimonies were strengthened as we talked about sacred truths.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,26,"Scripture study becomes the channel for the Spirit to give each of us a customized tutorial. As you study the scriptures each day, alone, and with your family,youwill learn to recognize the voice of the Spirit and will come to know God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,27,"In addition to our praying and studying the scriptures, we need to do God’s will."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,28,"The Savior is our perfect example. He said, “I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,29,"When the resurrected Savior appeared to the Nephites, He said, “Behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have sufferedthe willof the Fatherin all thingsfrom the beginning.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,30,"You and Ido the will of the Father by honoring our covenants, keeping the commandments, and serving God and our fellowmen."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,31,"My wife, Rhonda, and I have parents who are just regular people—probably a lot like your parents. But one thing I love about our parents is that they dedicated their lives to serving God, and they taught us to do the same."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,32,"When Rhonda’s parents had been married for just a couple of years, her 23-year-old dad was called to serve a full-time mission. He left behind his young wife and their 2-year-old daughter. Then his wife was called to serve with him during the last seven months of his mission—leaving their daughter in the care of relatives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,33,"A few years later, now withfourchildren, they moved to Missoula, Montana, so her dad could attend the university. However, they had been there only a few months when President Spencer W. Kimball and Elder Mark E. Petersen extended a call to myfather-in-law to be the first president of the newly created Missoula stake. He was only 34. Thoughts of the university were left behind as he sought to do theLord’swill—not his own."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,34,"Myparents have served in the temple for more than 30 years—Dad as a sealer, Mom as an ordinance worker. They also served five full-time missions together—in Riverside, California; Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Nairobi, Kenya; the Nauvoo Illinois Temple; and the Monterrey Mexico Temple. In Mexico they worked hard to learn a new language, which wasn’t easy at 80 years of age. But they sought to do the will of the Lord rather than to pursue their own desires in life."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,35,"To them, and to all such dedicated Latter-day Saints throughout the world, I echo the words spoken by the Lord to the prophet Nephi, the son of Helaman: “Blessed art thou, … for those things which thou hast done … with unwearyingness … , [for thou] hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,36,"Asweseek to do God’s will by faithfully serving Him and our fellowmen, we feel His approval and truly come to know Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,37,"The Savior tells us that the very best way to know God is to becomelikeHim. He taught: “Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,38,"Worthiness is essential to becoming like Him. He commanded, “Sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands … that I may make you clean.”Starting on the road to becoming like Him, we repent and receive His forgiveness, and He cleanses our souls."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,39,"To help us as we progress toward the Father, the Lord gave us this promise: “Every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face andknowthat I am.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,40,"Through our faith in His atoning sacrifice, the Savior cleanses us, heals us, and enables us toknowHim by helping us becomelikeHim. Mormon taught, “Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, … that ye may become the sons [and daughters] of God; that when he shall appear we shall belikehim.”As we strive to become like God, He can make of us more than we could ever make of ourselves."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,41,"To help us in our striving, God has given us role models and mentors. I want to share my feelings about one of mine, Elder Neal A. Maxwell. He constantly sought to submit his will to the will of the Father in his effort to become like God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,42,"More than 20 years ago, he shared his feelings with me after he had just been diagnosed with cancer. He told me, “I want to be on the team, on this side [of the veil] or that side. I don’t want to sit on the sidelines. I want to play in the game.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,43,"Over the next few weeks, he was reluctant to ask God to heal him; he just wanted to do God’s will. His wife, Colleen, pointed out that Jesus’s first cry in the Garden of Gethsemane was “If it be possible, let this cup pass from me.” Only then did the Savior say, “Nevertheless not as I will, but asthou wilt.”She encouraged Elder Maxwell to follow the Savior’s example, to ask for relief andthensubmit his will to God’s will, which he did."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,44,"After suffering through extensive, debilitating treatments for nearly a year, he was totally and completely back “in the game.” He served for seven more years."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,45,"I had several assignments with him during those subsequent years. I felt his kindness, compassion, and love. I witnessed his increased spiritual refinement through his ongoing suffering and his continued service as he strove to become like the Savior."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,46,"Theultimaterole model and mentor, available to all of us, is our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who said: “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”“Come and follow me.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,47,"My young brothers and sisters, knowing God is the quest of a lifetime. “And thisislife eternal, that[we]might know … the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom [the Father] hast sent.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,48,"“Shall we not go on in so great a cause? … Courage, [my young friends]; and on, on to the victory!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/and-this-is-life-eternal,Elder C. Scott Grow,49,"God knowsyouand invitesyouto knowHim.Pray to the Father, study the scriptures, seek to do God’s will, strive to become like the Savior, and follow righteous mentors. As you do,youwill come toknowGod and Jesus Christ, and you will inherit eternal life. This is my invitation to you as an ordained special witness of Them. They live. They love you. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,4,"A year and a half ago, President Russell M. Nelson spoke of the need “to teach and help raise a sin-resistant generation.”That phrase—“a sin-resistant generation”—struck a deep spiritual chord within me."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,5,"We honor children who strive to live pure and obedient lives. I have witnessed the strength of many children throughout the world. They stand resilient, “steadfast and immovable”in a variety of challenging circumstances and environments. These children understand their divine identity, feel Heavenly Father’s love for them, and seek to obey His will."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,6,"However, there are children who struggle to stand “steadfast and immovable” and whose delicate minds are being wounded.They are being attacked on every side by “the fiery darts of the adversary”and are in need of reinforcement and support. They are an overwhelming motivation for us to step up and wage a war against sin in our effort to bring our children unto Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,7,"Listen to the words of Elder Bruce R. McConkie nearly 43 years ago:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,8,"“As members of the Church, we are engaged in a mighty conflict. We are at war. We have enlisted in the cause of Christ to fight against Lucifer. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,9,"“The great war that rages on every side and which unfortunately is resulting in many casualties, some fatal, is no new thing. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,10,“Now there neither are nor can be any neutrals in this war.”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,11,"Today the war continues with increased intensity. The battle touches us all, and our children are on the front lines facing the opposing forces. Thus, the need intensifies for us to strengthen our spiritual strategies."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,12,"Fortifying children to become sin-resistant is a task and a blessing for parents, grandparents, family members, teachers, and leaders. We each bear responsibility to help. However, the Lord has specifically instructedparentsto teach their children “to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost” and “to pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,13,"How to “bring up [our] children in light and truth”may be a challenging question since it is individualized for each family and each child, but Heavenly Father has given universal guidelines that will help us. The Spirit will inspire us in the most effective ways we can spiritually inoculate our children."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,14,"To begin, having a vision of the importance of this responsibility is essential. We must understand our—and their—divine identity and purpose before we can help our children seewhothey are andwhythey are here. We must help them know without question that they are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father and that He has divine expectations of them."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,15,"Second, understanding the doctrine of repentance is essential for becoming resistant to sin. Being sin-resistant doesn’t mean being sinless, but it does imply being continually repentant, vigilant, and valiant. Perhaps being sin-resistant comes as a blessing from repeatedly resisting sin. As James said, “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,16,"The stripling warriors “were exceedingly valiant for courage … ; but behold, this was not all—they were … true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted. Yea, … they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.”These young men went to war carrying Christlike virtues as weapons against their adversaries. President Thomas S. Monson reminded us that “the call for courage comes constantly to each of us. Every day of our lives courage is needed—not just for the momentous events but more often as we make decisions or respond to circumstances around us.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,17,"Our children don spiritual armor as they establish patterns of personal daily discipleship. Perhaps we underestimate the abilities of children to grasp the concept of daily discipleship. President Henry B. Eyring counseled us to “start early and be steady.”So a third key to helping children become sin-resistant is to begin at very early ages to lovingly infuse them with basic gospel doctrines and principles—from the scriptures, the Articles of Faith, theFor the Strength of Youthbooklet, Primary songs, hymns, and our own personal testimonies—that will lead children to the Savior."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,18,"Creating consistent habits of prayer, scripture study, family home evening, and Sabbath worship leads to wholeness, internal consistency, and strong moral values—in other words, spiritual integrity. In today’s world where integrity has all but disappeared, our children deserve to understand what true integrity is and why it is so important—especially as we prepare them to make and keep sacred covenants at baptism and in the temple. AsPreach My Gospelteaches, “Keeping commitments prepares people [including very young people] to make and keep sacred covenants.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,19,"Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught, “When we talk about covenant keeping, we are talking about the heart and soul of our purpose in mortality.”There is unusual power in making and keeping covenants with our Heavenly Father. The adversary knows this, so he has obscured the concept of covenant making.Helping children understand, make, and keep sacred covenants is another key in creating a sin-resistant generation."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,20,How do we prepare our children to make and keep sacred covenants as they enter and progress along the covenant path? Teaching children to keep simple promises when they are young will empower them to keep holy covenants later in life.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,21,"Let me share a simple example: In family home evening, a father asked, “How are we getting along as a family?” Five-year-old Lizzie complained that her big brother, Kevin, was teasing her too much and hurting her feelings. Kevin reluctantly admitted that Lizzie was right. Kevin’s mother asked him what he could do to get along better with his sister. Kevin thought and decided he would promise Lizzie that he would go one whole day without teasing her."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,22,"At the end of the next day as everyone gathered for family prayer, Kevin’s dad asked Kevin how he had done. Kevin’s response was “Dad, I kept my promise!” Lizzie happily agreed, and the family congratulated Kevin."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,23,"Kevin’s mother then suggested that if he could keep his promise for one day, why couldn’t he do it for two days? Kevin agreed to try it again. Two days passed, Kevin was successful in keeping his promise, and Lizzie was even more thankful! When his father asked why he was keeping his promises so well, Kevin said, “I kept my promise because I said I would.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,24,"A succession of small, successfully kept promises leads to integrity. The consistent practice of promise keeping is spiritual preparation for children to receive their first covenant of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost, wherein they covenant to serve God and keep His commandments.Promises and covenants are inseparable."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,25,"In the book of Daniel, we learn of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego refusing to worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s idol.The king warned them that they would be cast into a burning fiery furnace if they didn’t comply. They refused and said:"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,28,"“But if not.” Consider the meaning of these three words and how they relate to keeping covenants. These three young men were not basing their obedience upon being delivered. Even if they were not delivered, they would keep their promise to the Lord because they said they would. Keeping our covenants is always independent of our situation. These three young men, just as the stripling warriors, are wonderful examples of sin-resistance for our children."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,29,"How do these examples apply in our homes and to our families? “Line upon line, precept upon precept,”we help children taste success in small bites. As they keep their promises, they feel the Spirit in their lives. Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin taught that “the consummate reward of integrity is the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.”Then shall our children’s “confidence wax strong in the presence of God.”Out of the well of integrity springs an empowered, sin-resistant generation."

Jones,30,"Brothers and sisters, hold your little ones close—so close that they see your daily religious behavior and watch you keeping your promises and covenants. “Children are great imitators, so give them something great to imitate.”We are indeed helping to teach and raise a sin-resistant generation unto the Lord promise by promise and covenant by covenant."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/a-sin-resistant-generation,Joy D. Jones,31,"I testify that Jesus Christ leads this Church. As you teach, lead, and love children in the Savior’s way, you can receive personal revelation that will aid you in creating and arming valiant, sin-resistant children. My prayer is that our children will echo the words of Nephi: “Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?”I testify that our Savior atoned for the sins of the world—because He said He would—and that He loves us more than we mere mortals can even comprehend—because He said He would. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

A disciple is one who has been baptized and is willing to take upon him or her the name of the Savior and follow Him. A disciple strives to become as He is by keeping His commandments in mortality, much the same as an apprentice seeks to become like his or her master."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,5,"Many people hear the worddiscipleand think it means only “follower.” But genuine discipleship is a state of being. This suggests more than studying and applying a list of individual attributes. Disciples live so that the characteristics of Christ are woven into the fiber of their beings, as into a spiritual tapestry."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,6,"Listen to the Apostle Peter’s invitation to become a disciple of the Savior:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,7,"“Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,8,“And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,9,“And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,10,"As you can see, weaving the spiritual tapestry of personal discipleship requires more than a single thread. In the Savior’s day, there were many who claimed to be righteous in one or another aspect of their lives. They practiced what I have called selective obedience. For example, they kept the commandment to refrain from work on the Sabbath yet criticized the Savior for healing on that holy day.They gave alms to the poor but offered only their excess—what they did not need for themselves.They fasted but only with long faces.They prayed but only to be seen of men.Jesus said, “They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.”Such men and women may focus on mastering a specific attribute or action but do not necessarily become as He is in their hearts."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,11,"Of these, Jesus declared:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,12,"“Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,13,"“And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,14,"The attributes of the Savior, as we perceive them, are not a script to be followed or list to be checked off. They are interwoven characteristics, added one to another, which develop in us in interactive ways. In other words, we cannot obtain one Christlike characteristic without also obtaining and influencing others. As one characteristic becomes strong, so do many more."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,15,"In2 Peterand inDoctrine and Covenants section 4, we learn that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation. We measure our faith by what it leads us to do—by our obedience.“If ye will have faith in me,” the Lord promised, “ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.”Faith is a catalyst. Without works, without virtuous living, our faith is without power to activate discipleship. Indeed, faith is dead."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,16,"And so, Peter explains, “add to your faith virtue.” This virtue is more than sexual purity. It is cleanliness and holiness in mind and body. Virtue is also power. As we faithfully live the gospel, we will have power to be virtuous in every thought, feeling, and action. Our minds become more receptive to the promptings of the Holy Ghost and the Light of Christ.We embody Christ not only in what we say and do but also in who we are."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,17,"Peter continues, “Add to [your] virtue, knowledge.” As we live virtuous lives, we come to know our Heavenly Father and His Son in a special way. “If any man will do [the Father’s] will, he shall know of the doctrine.”This knowledge is personal testimony, born from personal experience. It is knowledge that transforms us so that our “light cleaveth unto [His] light” and our “virtue loveth [His] virtue.”By our virtuous living, we make the journey from “I believe” to the glorious destination of “I know.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,18,"Peter exhorts us to add “to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience.” As temperate disciples, we live the gospel in a balanced and steady way. We do not “run faster than [we have] strength.”Day by day we move forward, undeterred by the refining challenges of mortality."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,19,"Being temperate in this way, we develop patience and trust in the Lord. We are able to rely on His design for our lives, even though we cannot see it with our own natural eyes.Therefore, we can “be still and know that [He is] God.”When faced with the storms of tribulation, we ask, “What wouldstThou have me learn from this experience?” With His plan and purposes in our hearts, we move forward not only enduring all things but also enduring them patiently and well."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,20,"This patience, Peter teaches, leads us to godliness. As the Father is patient with us, His children, we become patient with one another and ourselves. We delight in the agency of others and the opportunity it gives them to grow “line upon line,”“brighter and brighter until the perfect day.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,21,"From temperance to patience and from patience to godliness, our natures change. We gain the brotherly kindness that is a hallmark of all true disciples. Like the Good Samaritan, we cross the road to minister to whoever is in need, even if they are not within the circle of our friends.We bless them that curse us. We do good to those who despitefully use us.Is any attribute more godly or Christlike?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,22,"I testify that the efforts we make to become disciples of our Savior are truly added upon until we are “possessed” of His love.This love is the defining characteristic of a disciple of Christ:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,23,"“Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,24,"“And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,25,"It is faith, hope, and charity that qualify us for the work of God.“And now abideth … these three; but the greatest of these is charity.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,26,"Brothers and sisters, now more than ever, we cannot be a “part-time disciple”! We cannot be a disciple on just one point of doctrine or another. The constellation of characteristics that result from faith in Christ—including the ones we have talked about today—are all necessary to our standing strong in these last days."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,27,"As we earnestly strive to be true disciples of Jesus Christ, these characteristics will be interwoven, added upon, and interactively strengthened in us. There will be no disparity between the kindness we show our enemies and the kindness we bestow on our friends. We will be as honest when no one is looking as when others are watching. We will be as devoted to God in the public square as we are in our private closet."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,28,"I testify that everyone can be a disciple of the Savior. Discipleship is not constrained by age, gender, ethnic origin, or calling. Through our individual discipleship, we, as Latter-day Saints, build up a collective strength to bless our brothers and sisters throughout the world. Now is the time to recommit ourselves to being His disciples with all diligence."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/becoming-a-disciple-of-our-lord-jesus-christ,Elder Robert D. Hales,29,"Brothers and sisters, we are all called to be disciples of our Savior. Let this conference be your opportunity to “begin as in times of old, and come unto [Him] with all your heart.”This is His Church. I bear my special witness that He lives. May He bless us in our eternal quest to become devoted and valiant disciples. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/brighter-and-brighter-until-the-perfect-day,Elder Mark A. Bragg,9,"However, the adversary would rather have us focus on “mists of darkness … which blindeth the eyes, … hardeneth … hearts … , and … leadeth … away.”"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/brighter-and-brighter-until-the-perfect-day,Elder Mark A. Bragg,12,"I heard this eternal truth taught beautifully in an unexpected place. While I was working for a large bank, I was invited to attend an executive program at the University of Michigan. During the program, Professor Kim Cameron taught the concept of positive leadership and its heliotropic effect. He explained: “This refers to the tendency in all living systems toward positive energy [light] and away from negative energy [darkness]. From single-cell organisms to complex human systems, everything alive has an inherent inclination toward the positive and away from the negative.”"

This is a wonderful time to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! The Church is stronger than it has ever beenand quite literally grows stronger each day as new members join us, new congregations are formed, new missionaries are called, and new territories are opened to the gospel. We see those who have slipped from activity in the Church for a time returning as the rescue envisioned by President Thomas S. Monson brings daily miracles."

It has been that way from the beginning and will continue to the end. But we cannot allow such criticism to dull our sensitivity to the light that is available to us. Recognizing the light and seeking after it will qualify us for even more light."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/brighter-and-brighter-until-the-perfect-day,Elder Mark A. Bragg,18,"In a darkening world, thelight of the Churchwill shine brighter and brighter until the perfect day."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/brighter-and-brighter-until-the-perfect-day,Elder Mark A. Bragg,20,"Preach My Gospelstates: “Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.”Now more than ever, our families must be sources of great light to everyone around us. Families increase in light as they increase in love and kindness. As we establish families of “faith, … repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, [and] compassion,”we will feel an increase in love towards the Savior and towards one another. The family will grow stronger, and the light in each of us will grow brighter."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/brighter-and-brighter-until-the-perfect-day,Elder Mark A. Bragg,21,We read in the Bible Dictionary that “only the home can compare with the temple in sacredness.”We now have 155 operating temples and more coming soon. More and more families are sealed for time and all eternity. Members are submitting more and more names of ancestors to the temple to perform their saving ordinances. We truly are experiencing great joy and celebration on both sides of the veil!

Bragg,23,"You cannot speak of the lightinthe world without speaking of the Lightofthe World, Jesus Christ. A manifestation of a loving Heavenly Father is that everyone who comes to this life is blessed with the Light of Christ to help them return home. President Boyd K. Packer taught: “The Spirit of Christ is always there. … The Light of Christ is as universal as sunlight itself. Wherever there is human life, there is the Spirit of Christ.”The Light of Christ “inviteth and enticeth to do good continually”and prepares all who seek goodness and truth to receive the Holy Ghost."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/brighter-and-brighter-until-the-perfect-day,Elder Mark A. Bragg,24,"The Savior teaches that He is the light that “enlighteneth your eyes,” “quickeneth your understandings,” and “giveth life to all things.”The Light of Christ will help us see others through the Savior’s eyes. We will be more loving and understanding of the struggles of others. It will help us be more patient with those who may not worship as we do or serve as we might. It will help us understand the great plan of happiness more fully and see how we all fit into that great loving plan. It gives life, meaning, and purpose to all that we do. Now, with all the happiness that will come to us as we more fully understand the Light of Christ, it will not match the joy that we feel when we see the Light of Christ working in others: family, friends, and even complete strangers."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/brighter-and-brighter-until-the-perfect-day,Elder Mark A. Bragg,25,"I felt that joy when I heard about the efforts of a brave group of firefighters who fought to save a burning stake center in Southern California in 2015. As the fire raged, a battalion commander called an LDS friend to ask where the sacred relics and sacrament cups were kept so they could be saved. His friend assured him that there were no sacred relics and that the sacrament cups were actually very, very replaceable. But the commander felt he should do more, so he sent firefighters back into the burning building to pull every painting of Christ off of the walls that they might be preserved. They even placed one in the firetruck in the hope that the firefighters might be watched over. I was truly touched by the commander’s kindness, goodness, and sensitivity to the Light during a dangerous and difficult time."

He is the Light of the World. May we be strengthened by the light that is available to us through greater participation at church and greater application of gospel principles in our families. May we see the Light of Christ in others constantly and help them see it in themselves. As we receive that light, we will be blessed with more light, even until the perfect day when we again see “the Father of lights,”our Heavenly Father. I so testify in the holy name of the Light of the World, even Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,5,"I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we consider together principles pertaining to the great work of preaching the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,6,"Every year tens of thousands of young men and young women, and many senior couples, eagerly anticipate receiving a special letter from Salt Lake City. The content of the letter affects forever the person to whom it is addressed, as well as family members and a great number of other people. Upon arrival, the envelope may be opened neatly and patiently or ripped apart excitedly and with great haste. Reading this special letter is an experience never to be forgotten."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,7,"The letter is signed by the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the first two sentences read as follows: “You are hereby called to serve as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You are assigned to labor in the ______ Mission.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,8,Please note that the first sentence is a call to serve as a full-time missionary in the Lord’s restored Church. The second sentence indicates an assignment to labor in a specific place and mission. The important distinction expressed in these two sentences is essential for all of us to understand.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,9,"In the culture of the Church, we often talk of being called to serve in a country such as Argentina, Poland, Korea, or the United States. But a missionary is not called to a place; rather, he or she is called to serve. As the Lorddeclared through the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829, “If ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,10,"Each mission call and assignment, or a later reassignment, is the result of revelation through the Lord’s servants. A call to the work comes from God through the President of the Church. An assignment to one of the more than 400 missions presently operating around the world comes from God through a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, acting with the authorization of the Lord’s living prophet. The spiritual gifts of prophecy and revelation attend all mission calls and assignments."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,11,Section 80 of the Doctrine and Covenantsis a record of a mission call to Stephen Burnett extended by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1832. Studying this call to Brother Burnett can help us to (1) understand more clearly the distinction between being “called to the work” as a missionary and “assigned to labor” in a particular place and (2) appreciate more completely our individual and divinely appointed responsibility to proclaim the gospel.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,12,"Verse 1of this section is a call to serve: “Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,13,"Interestingly,verse 2informs Brother Burnett about his assigned missionary companion: “And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,14,"Verse 3indicates where these two missionaries are to labor: “Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,15,"I do not believe that the phrase “it mattereth not” as used by the Lord in this scripture suggests that He does not care where His servants labor. In fact, He cares deeply. But because the work of preaching the gospel is the Lord’s work, He inspires, guides, and directs His authorized servants. As missionaries strive to be ever more worthy and capable instruments in His hands and do their best to fulfill faithfully their duties, then with His help they “cannot go amiss”—wherever they serve. Perhaps one of the lessons the Savior is teaching us in this revelation is that an assignment to labor in a specific place is essential and important but secondary to a call to the work."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,16,"The next verse highlights important qualifications for all missionaries: “Therefore, declare the things which ye haveheard,and verilybelieve,andknow to be true.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,17,"The final verse reminds Brother Burnett and all of us from whom a call to serve truly comes: “Behold, this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,18,"Some of you may be asking yourselves why I have chosen to discuss in a priesthood session of general conference this seemingly obvious distinction between being called to the work and assigned to labor. My answer to this question is quite straightforward: my experience has taught me that these principles are not well understood by many members of the Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,19,"The single greatest reason for addressing this matter is what I have learned over time about the concern, the worry, and even the guilt felt by many missionaries who for various reasons were reassigned to a different field of labor during their time of service. Such reassignments sometimes are necessary because of events and circumstances such as physical accidents and injuries, delays and challenges in obtaining visas, political instability, creating and staffing new missions, or the evolving and ever-changing needs around the world in the work of proclaiming the gospel."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,20,"When a missionary is reassigned to a different field of labor, the process is precisely the same as for the initial assignment. Members of the Quorum of the Twelve seek inspiration and guidance in making all such reassignments."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,21,"I recently spoke with a faithful man who shared with me the deepest feelings of his heart. In a meeting, I had just explained the difference between being called to the work and assigned to labor. This good brother shook my hand and with tears in his eyes said to me, “The things you helped me learn today have lifted a burden from my shoulders that I have carried for more than 30 years. As a young missionary, I was initially assigned to a field of labor in South America. But I was unable to obtain a visa, so my assignment waschanged to the United States. All these years I have wondered why I was unable to serve in the place to which I had been called. Now I know I was called to the work and not to a place. I cannot tell you how much this understanding has helped me.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,22,"My heart ached for this good man. As I have taught these basic principles throughout the world, countless individuals have expressed privately to me the same sentiment as the man I just described. I am addressing this subject today because not a single member of this Church should carry an unnecessary burden of misunderstanding, uncertainty, anguish, or guilt about an assignment to labor."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,23,"“Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.”As you ponder the words of this scripture and open your heart, I hope and pray you will invite the Holy Ghost to carry deep into your soul the understanding, the healing, and the restoring you may need."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,24,"One additional reason I have felt impressed to discuss this topic is my personal experience assigning missionaries over many years. For the Twelve, nothing affirms the reality of ongoing latter-day revelation more powerfully than seeking to discern the Lord’s will as we fulfill our responsibility to assign missionaries to their respective fields of labor. I witness that the Savior knows and is mindful of each of us one by one and name by name."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,25,I now want to discuss briefly a fundamental but frequently overlooked aspect of preparing for a call to the work.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,26,"Three interrelated words define a pattern of preparation and progression for sons of God:priesthood, temple, mission.Sometimes as parents, friends, and Church members, we focus so extensively upon missionary preparation for young men that we may neglect to a degree the other vital steps along the covenant pathway that must be fulfilled before beginning full-time missionary service. Working as a missionary certainly is one but not the only important building block in the process of creating a strong foundation for a lifetime of spiritual growth and service. Priesthood and temple blessings, both of which precede arriving in an assigned field of labor, also are necessary to fortify and strengthen us spiritually throughout our entire lives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,27,"Young men, as you fulfill your duties in and honor the Aaronic Priesthood, or lesser priesthood, you are preparing to receive and magnify the oath and covenant of the Melchizedek Priesthood, or higher priesthood.Personal worthinessis the single most important requirement for receiving the higher priesthood. A lifetime of selfless priesthood service lies before you. Prepare now by frequently rendering meaningful service. Please learn to love being and remaining worthy. Be worthy. Stay worthy."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,28,"After receiving the Melchizedek Priesthood and a call to serve, a young man can be armed with powerthrough the covenants and ordinances of the holy temple. Going to the temple and having the spirit of the temple go through you precedes effective service as a full-time missionary. Personal worthiness is the single most important requirement for receiving the blessings of the temple for you young men and for all members of the Church. As you live in accordance with gospel standards, you can enter the house of the Lord and participate in sacred ordinances throughout your teenage years. Your love for and understanding of temple ordinances will strengthen and bless you throughout your life. Please learn to love being and remaining worthy. Be worthy. Stay worthy."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,29,"Many young men and young women already hold a current limited-use temple recommend. As Aaronic Priesthood holders, you are finding your own family names and performing baptisms and confirmations for your family members in the temple. Maintaining your temple recommend demonstrates your worthiness, and serving others in the temple is an important part of preparing for the Melchizedek Priesthood."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,30,"Young men, each of you is a missionary now. All around you, every day, are friends and neighbors “who are only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.”As you are directed by the Spirit, you can share a thought, an invitation, a text or tweet that will introduce your friends to the truths of the restored gospel. You need not and should not wait for your official call to become anxiously engaged in missionary work."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,31,"As priesthood, temple, and mission blessings are gathered “together in one … in Christ”and synergistically interact in the heart, mind, and soul of a young missionary, he can qualify for the work.His capacity is increased to fulfill the responsibility to represent authoritatively the Lord Jesus Christ. The spiritually potent combination of honoring priesthood and temple covenants, receiving “the power of godliness”through priesthood ordinances,serving selflessly, and proclaiming the everlasting gospel to God’s children enables a young man to become “firm and steadfast in the faith”and “rooted and built up in [Christ].”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,32,"In our homes and at church, we should give balanced emphasis to all three elements of the Lord’s pattern of preparation and progression for faithful sons of God:priesthood, temple, mission.All three require us to love being and remaining worthy. Be worthy. Stay worthy."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,33,"My beloved brethren, I promise that the spiritual gift of revelation will attend your call to the work of proclaiming the gospel and your assignment to a specific field or fields of labor. As you diligently prepare now through selfless priesthood and temple service, your witness of the Lord’s living reality will be strengthened. Love for Him and His work will fill your heart. As you learn to love being worthy, you will become a mighty instrument in the hands of the Lord to bless and serve many people."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/called-to-the-work,Elder David A. Bednar,34,"Joyfully, I witness that our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, live. To be engaged in Their service is one of the greatest blessings we can ever receive. I so testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,8,"Consider these accounts in the book of Luke. First, during the Savior’s ministry:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,9,"“And it came to pass … that [Jesus] went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,12,“Andcertain women… which were early at the sepulchre;
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,13,"“… When they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had … seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,14,"I have read and passed over the seemingly unremarkable expression “certain women” numerous times before, but recently as I pondered more carefully, those words seemed to jump off the page. Consider these synonyms of one meaning of the wordcertainasconnected to faithful,certain women:“convinced,” “positive,” “confident,” “firm,” “definite,” “assured,” and “dependable.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,15,"As I pondered those powerful descriptors, I remembered two of those New Testamentcertain womenwho bore positive, confident, firm, assured testimonies of the Savior. Though they, like us, were imperfect women, their witness is inspiring."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,16,"Remember the unnamed woman at the well who invited others to come and see what she had learned of the Savior? She bore hercertainwitness in the form of a question: “Is not this the Christ?”Her testimony and invitation were so compelling that “many … believed on him.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,17,"Following the death of her brother, Lazarus, Martha, the beloved disciple and friend of the Lord, declared with what must have been great emotion, “Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.” Consider her certainty as she continued, “But I know,that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.” She further testified, “I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,18,We learn from these sisters thatcertain womenare disciples centered in the Savior Jesus Christ and have hope through the promise of His atoning sacrifice.

Burton,19,"Anciently,certain womensacrificed as they testified and lived the teachings of Jesus.Certain womenin the early days of the Restoration did the same. Drusilla Hendricks and her family were among those who, as new converts, suffered during the persecution of the Saints in Clay County, Missouri. Her husband was permanently paralyzed during the Battle of Crooked River. She was left to care for him as well as provide for her family."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,20,"“At one particularly distressing time, when the family was out of food, she remembered that a voice told her, ‘Hold on, for the Lord will provide.’”"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,22,We learn from thiscertain womanthat covenant-keeping discipleship requires our willingness to sacrifice.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,24,"On my recent assignment to Asia, I was once again inspired by the manycertain womenI met. I was particularlyimpressed with first-generation members in India, Malaysia, and Indonesia who strive to live the gospel culture in their own homes, sometimes at great sacrifice, as gospel living often clashes with family and country cultures. The multigenerationalcertain womenI met in Hong Kong and Taiwan continue to bless the lives of their families, Church members, and communities by remaining centered in the Savior and willingly sacrificing to keep covenants. Similarcertain womenare found throughout the Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,25,"Acertain womanwho has blessed my life for decades has battled for the past 15 years the debilitating, difficult, and progressive disease called inclusion body myositis. Though confined to her wheelchair, she strives to be grateful and keeps up her “Can Can List”: a running list of things shecando, such as I can breathe, I can swallow, I can pray, and I can feel my Savior’s love. She bears her Christ-centeredcertainwitness almost daily to family and friends."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,26,"I recently heard Jenny’s story. She is a returned missionary whose parents divorced while she was serving her mission. She told how the thought of returning home “scared [her] to death.” But at the end of her mission to Italy, as she stopped in the mission home on her way home to the United States, acertain woman,the mission president’s wife, tenderly ministered to her simply by brushing her hair."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,27,"Years later, anothercertain woman,Terry—a stake Relief Society president and disciple of Jesus Christ—blessed Jenny’s life when Jenny was called as a ward Relief Society president. At that time, Jenny was working on her dissertation for her doctoral degree. Not only did Terry serve as a mentor to Jenny as a leader, but she also sat with her for 10 hours at the hospital when Jenny received the alarming diagnosis of leukemia. Terry visited the hospital and drove Jenny to appointments. Jenny confessed, “I think I may have thrown up several times in her car.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,28,"Despite her illness, Jenny continued to serve valiantly as the ward Relief Society president. Even in her extremity, she made phone calls and sent texts and emails from her bed, and she invited sisters to come see her. She mailed cards and notes to people, loving her sisters from a distance. When her ward requested a photograph of her presidency for their ward history, this is what they got. Because Jenny is acertain womanherself, she invited all to share others’ burdens, including her own."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/certain-women,Linda K. Burton,29,"As acertain woman,Jenny testified: “Not only are we here to save others but to save ourselves. And that salvation comes from partnering with Jesus Christ, from understanding His grace and His Atonement and His feelings of love for the women of the Church. That happens through things as simple as brushing someone’s hair; sending a note with an inspired, clear, revelatory message of hope and grace; or allowing women to serve us.”"

Let us be found staying close to Him in prayer and scripture study. Let us draw ourselves near to Him by preparing for and partaking of the sacred emblems of His atoning sacrifice weekly during the ordinance of the sacrament and as we keep covenants by serving others in their times of need.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,4,"Dear brothers and sisters, I want to begin my message today by testifying that I know that President Thomas S. Monson is the prophet of God in our day. His counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles are also, in fact, prophets, seers, and revelators. They represent the Lord Jesus Christ and have the right to declare His mind and will as it is revealed to them. I testify that there is safety in following their counsel. The Lord is inspiring them to emphasize strengthening our faith in Heavenly Father and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in His Atonement so that we will not waver as we face the challenges of our day."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,5,"In the Book of Mormon, we read about a man named Ammon who was sent from the land of Zarahemla to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire concerning his brethren. There he found King Limhi and his people, who were in bondage to the Lamanites. King Limhi was encouraged by the things Ammon shared with him about his people in Zarahemla. His heart was filled with such great hope and joy that he gathered his people to the temple and said:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,6,"“Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,7,"“… If ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, … and serve him with all diligence of mind, … he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,8,"The faith of King Limhi’s people was so profoundly affected by the words of Ammon that they made a covenant with God to serve Him and to keep His commandments, regardless of their difficult circumstances. Because of their faith, they were able to devise a plan to escape from the hands of the Lamanites."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,9,"Brothers and sisters, please consider the importance of the invitation King Limhi gave to his people and its relevance to us. He said, “Lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God.” With these words, Limhi invited his people to look to the future through the eyes of faith; to replace their fears with the optimism of hope born of faith; and to not waver in placing their trust in God regardless of circumstance."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,10,"Mortal life is a period of testing where we will be proven to see if we will do all things that the Lord our God shall command us.This will require unwavering faith in Christ even in times of great difficulty. It will require that we press forward with steadfast faith in Christ, being led by the Spirit and trusting that God will provide for our needs."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,11,"At the conclusion of His earthly ministry, just before being taken prisoner, the Savior taught His disciples, “In theworld ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,12,"Ponder with me for a moment—Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of the Father, lived a sinless life and overcame all the temptations, pains, challenges, and afflictions of the world. He shed drops of blood in Gethsemane; He suffered terrible pain beyond any power of description. He took upon Himself all our pains and sicknesses. He stands ready to help—to help each of us—with every burden. Through His life, suffering, death, and Resurrection, He removed every impediment to our rejoicing and finding peace on this earth. The benefits of His atoning sacrifice are extended to all those who accept Him and deny themselves and to those who take up His cross and follow Him as His true disciples.Therefore, as we exercise faith in Jesus Christ and in His Atonement, we will be strengthened, our burdens will be eased, and through Him we will overcome the world."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,13,"Brothers and sisters, as we contemplate the strength and hope that we can receive from the Savior, we do have reason to lift up our heads, rejoice, and press forward in faith without wavering, “for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. … A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,14,"King Limhi likewise urged, “Turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, … serve him withalldiligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,15,"Listen to the Savior’s own words as He entreats us:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,16,"“Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,17,"“If ye love me, keep my commandments. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,18,"“He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,19,"God blesses us according to our faith.Faith is the source of living with divine purpose and eternal perspective. Faith is a practical principle that inspires diligence. It is a vital, living force manifest in our positive attitude and desire to willingly do everything that God and Jesus Christ ask of us. It takes us to our knees to implore the Lord for guidance and to arise and act with confidence to achieve things consistent with His will."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,20,"Years ago while serving as a mission president, I received a phone call from the parents of one of our beloved missionaries informing me about the death of his sister. I remember, in the tenderness of that moment, that missionary and I discussed God’s marvelous plan of salvation for His children and how this knowledge would comfort him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,21,"Although he was stunned and saddened by that adversity, this missionary—through his tears and with faith in God—rejoiced in his sister’s life. He expressed unwavering confidence in the tender mercies of the Lord. Resolutely, he told me that he would continue to serve his mission with all faith and diligence in order to be worthy of the promises that God had for him and his family. In this time of need, that faithful missionary turned his heart to God, placed all of his trust in Him, and renewed his commitment to serve the Lord with faith and with all diligence."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,22,"Brothers and sisters, if we are not rooted by steadfast trust in God and the desire to serve Him, the painful experiences of mortality can lead us to feel as though we are burdened by a heavy yoke; and we can lose the motivation to live the gospel fully. Without faith, we will end up losing the capacity to appreciate those designs of our God regarding the things that will happen later in our life."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,23,"In these moments of trial, the adversary—who is always on the lookout—tries to use our logic and reasoning against us. He tries to convince us that it is useless to live the principles of the gospel. Please remember that the logic of the natural man “receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him.”Remember that Satan “is an enemy [of] God, and [he] fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth [us] to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.”We must not allow him to deceive us; for when we do, we falter in our faith and lose the power to obtain God’s blessings."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,24,"If we are steadfast and do not waver in our faith, the Lord will increase our capacity to raise ourselves above the challenges of life. We will be enabled to subdue negative impulses, and we will develop the capacity to overcome even what appear to be overwhelming obstacles. This was what enabled King Limhi’s people to make a spectacular escape from their Lamanite captivity."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,25,"Brothers and sisters, I invite you to place all of your trust in God and in the teachings of His prophets. I invite you to renew your covenants with God, to serve Him with all your heart, regardless of the complex situations of life. I testify that by the power of your unwavering faith in Christ, you will become free of the captivity of sin, of doubt, of unbelief, of unhappiness, of suffering; and you will receive all of the promised blessings from our loving Heavenly Father."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/confide-in-god-unwaveringly,Elder Ulisses Soares,26,"I testify that God is real. He lives. He loves us.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,4,My purpose is to “invite others to come unto Christ.”This is your purpose too. We can fulfill this purpose by looking up to Jesus Christ.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,5,"I was baptized with my parents when I was 16 years old. My younger brother, Kyung-Hwan, who was 14 years old, joined the Church through my uncle, Young Jik Lee, and invited us to his church. Each of the 10 members in our family belonged to a different church, so we were happy to find the truth and wanted to share that happiness we found in the gospel of Jesus Christ after we were baptized."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,6,"My father was the most excited among us to learn and share the truth. He used to wake up early in the morning to study the scriptures for over two hours every day. After work he went with the missionaries to visit our family, friends, and neighbors nearly every day. Seven months after we were baptized, 23 of my family and relatives became members of the Church. That was followed by the miracle of seeing 130 people baptized in the following year through my father’s member missionary work."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,7,"Family history was also important to him, and he completed eight generations of our ancestors. From that time on, the fruits of our family conversion, started by my 14-year-old brother, have increased in countless ways not only among the living but also among the dead. Building upon the work of my father and others, our family tree now spans to 32 generations, and we are now completing temple work for many branches. Today I am amazed and feel great joy linking our ancestors and our descendants."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,8,"President Gordon B. Hinckley recorded a similar experience in the Columbus Ohio Temple:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,9,"“Reflecting on the lives of [my great-grandfather, grandfather, and father] while I was seated in the temple, I looked down at my daughter, at her daughter, … and at her children, my great-grandchildren. I suddenly realized that I stood right in the middle of these seven generations—three before me and three after me."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,10,“In that sacred and hallowed house there passed through my mind a sense of the tremendous obligation that was mine to pass on all that I had received as an inheritance from my forebears tothe generations who have now come after me.”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,11,"All of us are in the middle of an eternal family. Our role can be a turning point at which significant changes can occur in positive or negative ways. President Hinckley continued, “Neverpermit yourselfto become a weak link in the chain of your generations.”Your faithfulness in the gospel will strengthen your family. How can we ensure we will be a strong link in our eternal family?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,12,"One day, a few months after my baptism, I heard some members criticizing each other in church. I was very disappointed. I went home and told my father that maybe I should not go to church anymore. It was difficult to see members criticize others like that. After listening, my father taught me that the gospel had been restored and it is perfect but members are not yet, neither himself nor me. He firmly said, “Do not lose your faith because of the people around you, but build a strong relationship with Jesus Christ. Don’t look around, look up!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,13,"Look up to Jesus Christ—the wise advice of my father—strengthens my faith whenever I face challenges in life. He taught me how to apply the teachings of Christ, as in these words: “Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,14,"When I was presiding over the Washington Seattle Mission, it rained many days of the year. Still, our missionaries were instructed to go out and proselyte in the rain. I used to tell them, “Go out in the rain, look up to heaven, open your mouth, and drink it! When you look up, you will be strengthened to open your mouth to everyone without any fear.” It was a symbolic lesson for them to look up when they faced challenges even after their mission. Please don’t try this in polluted areas."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,15,"While still serving in the Seattle mission, I received a phone call from my oldest son, Sunbeam, who is a pianist. He said he would have the privilege of performing at Carnegie Hall in New York because he won an international competition. We were so happy and very thrilled for him. However, that evening, while praying with gratitude, my wife recognized that we could not join him for his performance and said to Heavenly Father something like this: “Heavenly Father, I am grateful for the blessing Thou hast given to Sunbeam. By the way, I am sorry that I cannot go there. I could have gone if Thou had given this blessing either before or after this mission. I am not complaining, but I have a little feeling of sorry.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,16,"As soon as she finished this prayer, she heard a clear voice: “Because you cannot go, your son has been given this privilege. Would you rather trade?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,17,"My wife was surprised. She knew children would be blessed through their parents’ faithful work in the Lord’s kingdom, but it was the first time she understood her role with such clarity. She replied to Him right away: “No, no, it is OK for me not to go. Let him have that honor.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,18,"Dear brothers and sisters, it is not easy for us to recognize the love of Heavenly Father when we look around with our temporal eyes, because we see inconvenience, loss, burdens, or loneliness first. On the other hand, we can see the blessings beyond when we look up. The Lord has revealed, “When we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.”To all those who embark inanyservice of God, know that you are a solid connection for powerful blessings to those before you and to generations after you."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,19,"Today I am grateful to see that many of our family members are faithful on the covenant path but am saddened to imagine any empty seats next to us. Elder M. Russell Ballard said: “If you choose to become inactive or to leave the restored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where will you go? What will you do? The decision to ‘walk no more’ with Church members and the Lord’s chosen leaders will have a long-term impact that cannot always be seen right now.”President Thomas S. Monson encouraged us, “May we ever choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,20,It is never too late to look up to Jesus Christ. His arms are always open to you. There are generations before us and after us depending on us to follow Christ so that we can be an eternal family of God.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,21,"When I was released from my calling as a stake president, my sons were excited about spending more time with me. Three weeks later I was called as a Seventy. At first I thought they might be disappointed, but my youngest son’s humble response was “Daddy, don’t worry. We are an eternal family.” What a simple and clear truth it was! I worried a little because I looked around at this mortal life first, but my son was happy because he did not look around but looked up with eyes toward eternity and the purposes of the Lord."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,22,"It’s not always easy to look up when your parents are opposed to the gospel, when you are a member of a small Church unit, when your spouse is not a member, when you are still single although you did your best to marry, when a child has strayed, when you find yourself a single parent, when you are physically or emotionally challenged, when you are a victim in a disaster, and so on. Hold on to your faith in those hard times. Look up to Christ for strength, balance, and healing. Through the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, “all things shall work together for [your] good.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/dont-look-around-look-up,Elder Yoon Hwan Choi,23,"I bear witness of Jesus Christ, that He is our Savior and Redeemer. When we follow our living prophet, President Thomas S. Monson, we look up to Jesus Christ. As we pray and study the scriptures every day and partake sincerely of the sacrament every week, we gain the strength toalwayslook up to Him. I am happy to be a member of this Church and to be a part of an eternal family. I love to share this great gospel with others. Inviting others to come unto Christ is our purpose, and we can fulfill this purpose by looking up to Jesus Christ. I humbly testify of these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Challenges, controversies, and complexities swirl around us. These turbulent times were foreseen by the Savior. He warned us that in our day the adversary would stir up anger in the hearts of men and lead them astray.Yet our Heavenly Father never intended that we would deal with the maze of personal problems and social issues on our own."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,5,"God so loved the world that He sent His Only Begotten Sonto help us.And His Son, Jesus Christ, gave His life for us. All so that we could have access to godly power—power sufficient to deal with the burdens, obstacles, and temptations of our day.Today I would like to speak abouthowwe can draw into our lives the power of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,6,"We begin by learning about Him.“It is impossible for [us] to be saved in ignorance.”The more we know about the Savior’s ministry and mission—the more we understand His doctrineand what He did for us—the more we know that He can provide the power that we need for our lives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,7,"Earlier this year, I asked the young adults of the Church to consecrate a portion of their time each week to studyeverythingJesus said and did as recorded in the standard works.I invited them to let the scriptural citations about Jesus Christ in the Topical Guide become their personal core curriculum."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,8,"I gave that challenge because I had already accepted it myself. I read and underlinedeveryverse cited about Jesus Christ, as listed under the main heading and the 57 subtitles in the Topical Guide.When I finished that exciting exercise, my wife asked me what impact it had on me. I told her, “I am a different man!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,9,"I felt a renewed devotion to Him as I read again in the Book of Mormon the Savior’s own statement about His mission in mortality. He declared:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,10,"“I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,11,“And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross.”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,12,"As Latter-day Saints, we refer to His mission as the Atonement of Jesus Christ, which made resurrection a reality for all and made eternal life possible for those who repent of their sins and receive and keep essential ordinances and covenants."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,13,"It is doctrinally incomplete to speak of the Lord’s atoning sacrifice by shortcut phrases, such as “the Atonement” or “the enabling power of the Atonement” or “applying the Atonement” or “being strengthened by the Atonement.” These expressions present a real risk of misdirecting faith by treating theeventas ifithad living existence and capabilities independent of our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,14,"Under the Father’s great eternal plan, it is the Savior who suffered. It is the Savior who broke the bands of death. It is the Savior who paid the price for our sins and transgressions and blots them out on condition of our repentance. It is the Savior who delivers us from physical and spiritual death."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,15,"There is no amorphous entity called “the Atonement” upon which we may call for succor, healing, forgiveness, or power. Jesus Christ is the source. Sacred terms such asAtonementandResurrectiondescribe what the Savior did, according to the Father’s plan, so that we may live with hope in this life and gain eternal life in the world to come. The Savior’s atoning sacrifice—the central act of all human history—is best understood and appreciated when we expressly and clearly connect it to Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,16,"The importance of the Savior’s mission was emphasized by the Prophet Joseph Smith, who declared emphatically that “the fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,17,"It was this very statement of the Prophet that provided the incentive for 15 prophets, seers, and revelators to issue and sign their testimony to commemorate the 2,000th anniversary of the Lord’s birth. That historic testimony is titled “The Living Christ.”Many members have memorized its truths. Others barely know of its existence. As you seek to learn more about Jesus Christ, I urge you to study “The Living Christ.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,18,"As we invest time in learning about the Savior and His atoning sacrifice, we are drawn to participate in another key element to accessing His power: we choose to have faith in Him and follow Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,19,"True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from the people of the world. They are undaunted, devoted,and courageous. I learned of such disciples during a recent assignment in Mexico, where I met with government officials as well as leaders of other religious denominations. Each thanked me for our members’ heroic and successful efforts to protect and preserve strong marriages and families in their country."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,20,"There is nothing easy or automatic about becoming such powerful disciples. Our focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him ineverythought.But when we do, our doubts and fears flee."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,21,"Recently I learned of a fearless young Laurel. She was invited to participate in a statewide competition for her high school on the same evening she had committed to participate in a stake Relief Society meeting. When she realized the conflict and explained to competition officials that she would need to leave the competition early to attend an important meeting, she was told she would be disqualified if she did so."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,22,"What did this latter-day Laurel do? She kept her commitment to participate in the Relief Society meeting. As promised, she was disqualified from the statewide competition. When asked about her decision, she replied simply, “Well, the Church is more important, isn’t it?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,23,Faith in Jesus Christ propels us to do things we otherwise would not do. Faith that motivates us to action gives us more access to His power.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,24,"We also increase the Savior’s power in our lives when we make sacred covenants and keep those covenants with precision. Our covenants bind us to Him and give us godly power. As faithful disciples, we repent and follow Him into the waters of baptism. We walk along the covenant path to receive other essential ordinances.And gratefully, God’s plan provides for those blessings to be extended to ancestors who died without an opportunity to obtain them during their mortal lives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,25,"Covenant-keeping men and women seek for ways to keep themselves unspotted from the world so there will be nothing blocking their access to the Savior’s power. One faithful wife and mother wrote this recently: “These are troubled and perilous times. How blessed we are to have the increased knowledge of the plan of salvation and the inspired guidance from loving prophets, apostles, and leaders to help us sail these stormy seas safely. We stopped our habit of turning on the radio in the morning. Instead, we now listen to a general conference talk on our mobile phones every morning as we prepare ourselves for another day.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,26,"Another element in drawing the Savior’s power into our lives is to reach up to Him in faith. Such reaching requires diligent, focused effort."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,27,"Do you remember the biblical story of the woman who suffered for 12 years with a debilitating problem?She exercised great faith in the Savior, exclaiming, “If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,28,"This faithful, focused woman needed to stretch as far as she couldto access His power. Her physical stretching was symbolic of her spiritual stretching."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,29,"Many of us have cried out from the depths of our hearts a variation of this woman’s words: “If I could spiritually stretch enough to draw the Savior’s power into my life, I would know how to handle my heart-wrenching situation. I would know what to do. And I would have the power to do it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/drawing-the-power-of-jesus-christ-into-our-lives,President Russell M. Nelson,30,"When you reach up for the Lord’s power in your life with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air, power from Jesus Christ will be yours. When the Savior knows you truly want to reach up to Him—when He can feel that the greatest desire of your heart is to draw His power into your life—you will be led by the Holy Ghost to know exactly what you should do."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,4,"This has been a magnificent general conference. We have truly been edified. If there is one preeminent objective of general conference, it is to build faith in God the Father and our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,5,My remarks address the foundations of that faith.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,6,"Personal foundations, like many worthwhile pursuits, are usually built slowly—one layer, one experience, one challenge, one setback, and one success at a time. A most cherished physical experience is a baby’s first steps. It is magnificent to behold. The precious look on the face—a combination of determination, joy, surprise, and accomplishment—is truly a seminal event."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,7,"In our family, there is one event of a similar nature that stands out. When our youngest son was about four years old, he came into the house and gleefully announced to the family with great pride: “I can do everything now. I can tie, I can ride, and I can zip.” We understood he was telling us that he could tie his shoes, he could ride his Big Wheel tricycle, and he could zip his coat. We all laughed but realized that for him they were monumental achievements. He thought he had truly arrived and was grown up."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,8,"Physical, mental, and spiritual development have much in common. Physical development is fairly easy to see. We begin with baby steps and progress day by day, year by year, growing and developing to attain our ultimate physical stature. Development is different for each person."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,9,"When we watch a great athletic or musical performance, we often say that the person is very gifted, which is usually true. But the performance is based upon years of preparation and practice. One well-known writer, Malcolm Gladwell, has called this the 10,000-hour rule. Researchers have determined that this amount of practice is necessary in athletics, musical performance, academic proficiency, specialized work skills, medical or legal expertise, and so on. One of these research experts asserts “that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert—in anything.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,10,"Most people recognize that to obtain peak physical and mental performance, such preparation and practice are essential."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,11,"Unfortunately, in an increasingly secular world, less emphasis is placed on the amount of spiritual growth necessary to become more Christlikeand establish the foundations that lead to enduring faith. We tend to emphasize moments of sublime spiritual understanding. These are precious instances when we know the Holy Ghost has witnessed special spiritual insights to our hearts and minds. We rejoice in these events; they should not be diminished in any way. But for enduring faith and to have the constant companionship of the Spirit, there is no substitute for the individual religious observance that is comparable to physical and mental development. We should build on these experiences, which sometimes resemble initial baby steps. We do this by consecrated commitment to sacred sacrament meetings, scripture study, prayer, and serving as called. In one recent obituary tribute for the father of 13 children, it was reported his “loyalty to daily prayer and scripture study profoundly influenced his children, giving them an immovable foundation of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,12,"An experience I had when I was 15 years old was foundational for me. My faithful mother had valiantly tried to help me establish the foundations of faith in my life. I attended sacrament meeting, Primary, then Young Men and seminary. I had read the Book of Mormon and had always prayed individually. At that time a dramatic event occurred in our family when my beloved older brother was considering a potential mission call. My wonderful father, a less-active Church member, wanted him to continue his education and not serve a mission. This became a point of contention."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,13,"In a remarkable discussion with my brother, who was five years older and led the discussion, we concluded that his decision on whether to serve a mission depended on three issues: (1) Was Jesus Christ divine? (2) Was the Book of Mormon true? (3) Was Joseph Smith the prophet of the Restoration?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,14,"As I prayed sincerely that night, the Spirit confirmed to me the truth of all three questions. I also came to understand that almost every decision I would make for the rest of my life would be based on the answers to those three questions. I particularly realized that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ was essential. In looking back, I recognize that, primarily because of my mother, the foundations were in place for me to receive the spiritual confirmation that evening. My brother, who already had a testimony, made the decision to serve a mission and ultimately won our father’s support."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,15,"Spiritual guidance is received when needed, in the Lord’s time and according to His will.The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ is an excellent example. I recently viewed a first edition of the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith completed the translation when he was 23 years old. We know something of the process and instruments he used in that translation. In that first 1830 printing, Joseph included a short preface and simply and clearly declared it was translated “by the giftand power of God.”What about the aids to translation—the Urim and Thummim, the seer stones? Were they essential, or were they like the training wheels on a bicycle until Joseph could exercise the faith necessary to receive more direct revelation?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,16,"Just as repetition and consistent effort are required to gain physical or mental capacity, the same is true in spiritual matters. Remember that the Prophet Joseph received the same visitor, Moroni, with exactly the same message four times in preparation for receiving the plates. I believe that weekly participation in sacred sacrament meetings has spiritual implications we do not fully understand. Pondering the scriptures regularly—rather than reading them occasionally—can substitute a superficial understanding for a sublime, life-changing enhancement of our faith."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,17,"Faith is a principle of power. Let me illustrate: When I was a young missionary, a great mission presidentintroduced me in a profound way to the scriptural account found inLuke 8of the woman who had an issue of blood for 12 years and had spent everything she had on physicians who could not heal her. It has remained to this day one of my favorite scriptures."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,18,"You will remember that she had faith that if she could but touch the border of the Savior’s garment, she would be healed. When she did so, she was healed immediately. The Savior, who was walking along with His disciples, said, “Who touched me?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,19,"Peter’s answer was that all of them, walking together, were pressing against Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,20,"“And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,21,"The root word forvirtuecould easily be interpreted as “power.” In Spanish and Portuguese, it is translated as “power.” But regardless, the Savior did not see her; He had not focused on her need. But her faith was such that touching the border of the garment drew upon the healing power of the Son of God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,22,"As the Savior said to her, “Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,23,"I have contemplated this account all my adult life. I realize that our personal prayers and supplications to a loving Father in Heaven in the name of Jesus Christ can bring blessings into our lives beyond our ability to comprehend. The foundations of faith, the kind of faith that this woman demonstrated, should be the great desire of our hearts."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,24,"However, initial foundations of faith, even with spiritual confirmation, do not mean that we will not face challenges. Conversion to the gospel does not mean all our problems will be solved."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,25,Early Church history and recorded revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants contain excellent examples of establishing foundations of faith and dealing with the vicissitudes and challenges that everyone faces.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,26,"The completion of the Kirtland Temple was foundational for the entire Church. It was accompanied by spiritual outpourings, doctrinal revelations, and restoration of essential keys for the continuing establishment of the Church. Like the ancient Apostles on the day of Pentecost, many members experienced marvelous spiritual experiences in connection with the dedication of the Kirtland Temple.But, as in our own lives, this did not mean they wouldn’t face challenges or hardships going forward. Little did these early members know they would be faced with a United States financial crisis—the panic of 1837—that would test their very souls."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,27,"One example of the challenges related to this financial crisis was experienced by Elder Parley P. Pratt, one of the great leaders of the Restoration. He was an original member of the Quorumof the Twelve Apostles. In the early part of 1837, his dear wife, Thankful, died after delivering their first child. Parley and Thankful had been married almost 10 years, and her death devastated him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,28,"A few months later, Elder Pratt found himself in one of the most difficult times the Church has experienced. In the midst of the national crisis, local economic issues—including land speculation and the struggles of a financial institution founded by Joseph Smith and other Church members—created discord and contention in Kirtland. Church leaders did not always make wise temporal decisions in their own lives. Parley suffered significant financial losses and for a time became disaffected with the Prophet Joseph.He wrote a stinging criticism to Joseph and spoke in opposition of him from the pulpit. At the same time, Parley said he continued to believe in the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,29,"Elder Pratt had lost his wife, his land, and his home. Parley, without telling Joseph, left for Missouri. On the road there, he unexpectedly met fellow Apostles Thomas B. Marsh and David Patten returning to Kirtland. They felt a great need to have harmony restored to the Quorum and persuaded Parley to return with them. He realized that no one had lost more than Joseph Smith and his family."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,30,"Parley sought out the Prophet, wept, and confessed that what he had done was wrong. In the months after his wife, Thankful’s, death, Parley had been “under a dark cloud” and had been overcome by fears and frustrations.Joseph, knowing what it was like to struggle against opposition and temptation, “frankly forgave” Parley, praying for him and blessing him.Parley and others who remained faithful benefited from the Kirtland challenges. They increased in wisdom and became more noble and virtuous. The experience became part of their foundations of faith."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,31,"Adversity should not be viewed as either disfavor from the Lord or a withdrawal of His blessings. Opposition in all things is part of the refiner’s fire to prepare us for an eternal celestial destiny.When the Prophet Joseph was in Liberty Jail, the words of the Lord to him described all manner of challenges—including tribulations and false accusations—and conclude:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,32,"“If the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,33,“The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,34,"The Lord, in this instruction to Joseph Smith, also made it clear that his days were known and would not be numbered less. The Lord concluded, “Fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,35,"What, then, are the blessings of faith? What does faith accomplish? The list is almost endless:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,36,Our sins can be forgiven because of faith in Christ.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,37,As many as have faith have communion with the Holy Spirit.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,38,Salvation comes through faith on Christ’s name.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,39,We receive strength according to our faith in Christ.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,40,None enter the Lord’s rest save those who wash their garments in Christ’s blood because of their faith.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,41,Prayers are answered according to faith.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,42,"Without faith among men, God can do no miracle among them."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,43,"In the end, our faith in Jesus Christ is the essential foundation for our eternal salvation and exaltation. As Helaman taught his sons, “Remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation … , which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/foundations-of-faith,Elder Quentin L. Cook,44,"I am grateful for the fortification of the foundations of faith that has come from this conference. My plea is that we will make the sacrifices and have the humility necessary to strengthen the foundations of our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Of Him I bear my sure witness in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Eyring,9,"You see, the names “brother” and “sister” are not just friendly greetings or terms of endearment for us. They are an expression of an eternal truth: God is the literal Father of all mankind; we are each part of His eternal family. Because He loves us with the love of a perfect Father, He wants us to progress and advance and become like Him. He ordained a plan by which we would come to earth, in families, and have experiences that would prepare us to return to Him and live as He lives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,10,"The central element of this plan was the promise that Jesus Christ would offer Himself as a sacrifice, to rescue us from sin and death. Our task in that plan is to accept the Savior’s sacrifice by obeying the laws and ordinances of the gospel. You and I accepted this plan. In fact, we rejoiced in it, even though it would mean that we would leave the presence of our Father and forget what we had experienced there with Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,11,"But we were not sent here completely in the dark. Each of us was given a portion of God’s light, called the “Light of Christ,” to help us distinguish between good and evil, right and wrong. This is why even those who live with little or no knowledge of the Father’s plan can still sense, in their hearts, that certain actions are just and moral while others are not."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,12,"Our sense of right and wrong seems especially keen when we are raising our children. Innate in almost every parent is the desire to teach his or her children moral virtues. This is part of the miracle of Heavenly Father’s plan. He wants His children to come to earth, following the eternal pattern of families that exists in heaven. Families are the basic organizational unit of the eternal realms, and so He intends for them also to be the basic unit on earth. Though earthly families are far from perfect, they give God’s children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heaven—parental love. Families are also the best way to preserve and pass on moral virtues and true principles that are most likely to lead us back to God’s presence."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,13,"Only a very small minority of God’s children obtain during this life a complete understanding of God’s plan, along with access to the priesthood ordinances and covenants that make the Savior’s atoning power fully operative in our lives. Even those with the best of parents may live faithfully according to the light they have but never hear about Jesus Christ and His Atonement or be invited to be baptized in His name. This has been true for countless millions of our brothers and sisters throughout the world’s history."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,14,"Some may consider this unfair. They may even take it as evidence that there is no plan, no specific requirements for salvation—feeling that a just, loving God would not create a plan that is available to such a small proportion of His children. Others might conclude that God must have determined in advance which of His children He would save and made the gospel available to them, while those who never heard the gospel simply were not “chosen.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,15,"But you and I know, because of the truths restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, that God’s plan is much more loving and just than that. Our Heavenly Father is anxious to gatherand bless all of His family. While He knows that not all of them will choose to be gathered, His plan gives each of His children the opportunity to accept or reject His invitation. And families are at the heart of this plan."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,16,"Centuries ago, the prophet Malachi said that in a coming day, God would send Elijah to “turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers” (Malachi 4:6)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,17,"This prophecy was so important the Savior quoted it when He visited the Americas after His Resurrection (see3 Nephi 25:5–6). And when the angel Moroni visited the Prophet Joseph Smith, he too quoted the prophecy about Elijah and hearts, fathers, and children (seeJoseph Smith—History 1:36–39)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,18,"Today is April 1. Two days from now, April 3, marks 181 years from the day when Malachi’s prophecy was fulfilled. On that day, Elijah did come, and he gave to Joseph Smith the priesthood power to seal families eternally (seeD&C 110:13–16)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,19,"From that day to this, interest in exploring one’s family history has grown exponentially. At ever-increasing rates, people seem drawn to their ancestry with more than just casual curiosity. Genealogical libraries, associations, and technologies have emerged around the world to support this interest. The internet’s power to enhance communications has enabled families to work together to do family history research with a speed and thoroughness never before possible."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,20,"Why is all of this happening? For lack of a better term, we call it the “spirit of Elijah.” We could also equally call it “fulfillment of prophecy.” I bear testimony that Elijah did come. The hearts of the children—of you and me—have turned to our fathers, our ancestors. The affection you feel for your ancestors is part of the fulfillment of that prophecy. It is deeply seated in your sense of who you are. But it has to do with more than just inherited DNA."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,21,"For example, as you follow the promptings to learn about your family history, you may discover that a distant relative shares some of your facial features or your interest in books or your talent for singing. This could be very interesting and even insightful. But if your work stops there, you will sense that something is missing. This is because to gather and unite God’s family requires more than just warm feelings. It requires sacred covenants made in connection with priesthood ordinances."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,22,"Many of your ancestors did not receive those ordinances. But in the providence of God, you did. And God knew that you would feel drawn to your ancestors in love and that you would have the technology necessary to identify them. He also knew that you would live in a time when access to holy temples, where the ordinances can be performed, would be greater than ever in history. And He knew that He could trust you to accomplish this work in behalf of your ancestors."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,23,"Of course, all of us have many pressing and important responsibilities that need our attention and time. All of us find parts of what the Lord expects us to do beyond our abilities. Fortunately, the Lord provides a way for each of us to gain confidence and satisfaction in all our service, including family history service. We gain strength to do what He asks through our faith that the Savior gives no commandment “save he shall prepare a way for [us] that [we] may accomplish the thing which he commandeth” (1 Nephi 3:7)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,24,"I know this is true from experience. Many years ago, as a university student, I met a man who worked for one of the largest computer companies in the world. This was in the early days of computing, and it just so happened that his company had sent him to sell computers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,25,"As far as I could tell, this salesman had no religious faith. Yet he said with wonder and exasperation, “In this church they were doing what they called ‘genealogy,’ searching for names of people who are dead, trying to identify their ancestors. People, mostly women, were running around between filing cabinets, searching through little cards for information.” If I rememberright, he said the ladies were wearing tennis shoes so they could run a little faster. The man went on, “As I saw the magnitude of what they were trying to do, I realized that I had discovered the reason for the invention of computers.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,26,"Well, he was partially right. Computers would be an important part of the future of family history work—just not the computers he was selling. An inspired leader of the Church chose not to buy his computers. The Church was to wait for technology that at that time had not yet even been imagined. But I have learned in the many years since that even the best technology can never be a substitute for revelation from heaven, like the kind that Church leader received. This is a spiritual work, and the Lord directs it through His Holy Spirit."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,27,"Just a few weeks ago, I was working on my family history with a consultant by my side and another helper on the phone. On the computer screen before me was a problem beyond my mortal power to solve. I saw two names, sent to me by the wonders of technology, of people who might be waiting for a temple ordinance. But the trouble was that the names were different, but there was a reason to believe they might be the same person. My task was to determine what was true."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,28,"I asked my consultants to tell me. They said, “No, you must choose.” And they were completely sure I would discover the truth. The computer, with all its power and information, had left me the blessing of staring at those names on a screen, evaluating the available information, seeking other research, praying silently, and discovering what was true. As I prayed, I knew with surety what to do—just as I have in other situations when I needed to rely on heaven’s help to solve a problem."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,29,"We do not know what marvels God will inspire people to create to help in His work of gathering His family. But whatever marvelous inventions may come, their use will require the Spirit working in people like you and me. This should not surprise us. After all, these are beloved sons and daughters of God. He will send whatever inspiration is needed to give them the opportunity to return to Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,30,"In recent years, the youth of the Church have responded to the spirit of Elijah in an inspiring way. Many now hold their own limited-use temple recommend and use it often. Temple baptistries are busier than ever; some temples have even had to adjust their schedules to accommodate the increase in the number of young people attending the temple."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,31,"It used to be a rare but welcome exception for youth to bring the names of their own ancestors to the temple. Now this is the norm, and very often it is the young people themselves who found those ancestors."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,32,"In addition, many youth have discovered that giving of their time to do family history research and temple work has deepened their testimony of the plan of salvation. It has increased the influence of the Spirit in their lives and decreased the influence of the adversary. It has helped them feel closer to their families and closer to the Lord Jesus Christ. They have learned that this work saves not just the dead; it saves all of us (seeD&C 128:18)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,33,"The youth have caught the vision admirably; now their parents need to catch up. There are now many people who have accepted baptism in the spirit world because of the work done by the youth, and they are waiting for other ordinances that only adults can perform in temples in this world. The work of gathering Heavenly Father’s family is not just for young people, and it is not just for grandparents. It is for everyone. We are all gatherers."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,34,"This is the work of our generation, what the Apostle Paul called “the dispensation of the fulness of times,” when he said God would “gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him” (Ephesians 1:10). This is made possible through the atoning work of God’s Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Because of Him, our family members, “who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us” (Ephesians 2:13–14). You have felt this, as I have, when you have experienced an increase of love as you looked at the picture of an ancestor. You have felt it in the temple when the name on a card seemed like more than a name, and you couldn’t help but sense that this person was aware of you and felt your love."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/gathering-the-family-of-god,President Henry B. Eyring,35,"I testify that God the Father wants His children home again, in families and in glory. The Savior lives. He directs and blesses this work, and He watches over and guides us. He thanks you for your faithful service in gathering His Father’s family, and I promise you the inspired help that you seek and need. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,4,"One of Heavenly Father’s most beloved tools in guiding His children is righteous grandparents. My father’s mother was such a woman. On an occasion that took place when I was too young to remember, my father was disciplining me. Observing this correction, my grandmother said, “Monte, I believe you are correcting him too harshly.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,5,"My father replied, “Mother, I will correct my children as I want.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,6,"And my wise grandmother softly stated, “And so will I.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,7,I’m pretty sure my father heard the wise guidance of his mother that day.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,8,"When thinking of guidance, we might think of a hymn we all know and love—“I Am a Child of God.” In the chorus we find the words “Lead me, guide me, walk beside me, help me find the way.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,9,"Until recently, I understood that chorus to be divine direction to parents. While pondering these words, I realized that while they contain that direction, there exists a far greater meaning. Individually, we each plead daily that Heavenly Father will guide us, lead us, and walk beside us."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,10,"President Dieter F. Uchtdorf explained: “Our Father in Heaven knows His children’s needs better than anyone else. It is His work and glory to help us at every turn, giving us marvelous temporal and spiritual resources to help us on our path to return to Him.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,11,"Listen to those words: Heavenly Father knows what you and I need better than anyone else. As a result, He has developed a personal care package suited to each one of us. It has many components. It includes His Son and the Atonement, the Holy Ghost, commandments, scriptures, prayer, prophets, apostles, parents, grandparents, local Church leaders, and many others—all to help us return to live with Him someday."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,12,"May I share today just a few of the components of the care package that have made me recognize that a loving Father is leading, guiding, and walking beside me and my family? My prayer is that each of you will recognize in your experiences that Heavenly Father is leading, guiding, and walking beside you and, with that knowledge, you will proceed with confidence, knowing you are never really alone."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,13,"Heavenly Father’s commandments are key components of the care package. Alma declared, “Wickedness never was happiness.”Tolerating improper behavior without loving correction is false compassion and reinforces the common notion that wickedness might in fact be happiness. Samuel the Lamanite clearly countered this notion: “Ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,14,"Through His prophets, Heavenly Father constantly reminds us that righteousness is happiness. King Benjamin, for example, taught that Heavenly Father “doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for whichif ye do, he doth immediately bless you.”From another hymn comes the similar reminder:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,15,Keep the commandments; keep the commandments!
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,16,In this there is safety; in this there is peace.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,17,He will send blessings.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,18,"Around my 14th birthday, I learned about some of these blessings. I noticed different behavior on the part of my parents. Considering what I observed, I asked, “Are we going on a mission?” The shock on my mother’s face confirmed my suspicion. Later, in a family council, my siblings and I learned that our parents had been called to preside over a mission."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,19,"We lived on a beautiful ranch in Wyoming. From my perspective, life was perfect. I could come home from school, complete my chores, and be off hunting, fishing, or exploring with my dog."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,20,"Shortly after learning of the calling, I realized that I would have to give up my dog, Blue. I confronted my father, asking what I should do with Blue. I wanted to emphasize the unfairness of what God was requiring. I will never forget this response. He said, “I’m not sure. He probably cannot go with us, so you had better ask Heavenly Father.” That was not the response I had anticipated."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,21,"I began reading the Book of Mormon. I earnestly prayed to know if I had to give my dog away. My answer did not come in a moment; rather, a specific thought kept penetrating my mind: “Don’t be a burden to your parents. Don’t be a burden. I have called your parents.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,22,"I knew what Heavenly Father required. That knowledge did not reduce the pain of giving my dog away. However, through that small sacrifice, my heart softened and I found peace in seeking Heavenly Father’s will."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,23,"I thank my Heavenly Father for the blessings and happiness I found through the scriptures, prayer, the Holy Ghost, and a worthy earthly father who embraced his role as the principal gospel teacher of his children. They were leading me, guiding me, and even walking beside me to help me find the way—especially when I had to do something difficult."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,24,"In addition to having the care package components I’ve mentioned, we are each blessed with a priesthood leader to lead and guide us."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,25,"President Boyd K. Packer said: “Bishops are inspired! Each of us has agency to accept or reject counsel from our leaders, but never disregard the counsel of your bishop, whether given over the pulpit or individually.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,26,"These men strive to represent the Lord. Whether we are old or young, when Satan wants us to think all is lost, bishops are there to guide us. When speaking with bishops, I have found a common theme regarding confessions of disobedience or the innocent suffering from terrible wrongs. Bishops instantly want to express Heavenly Father’s love for the individual and a desire to walk beside him or her as he or she finds the way home."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,27,"Perhaps Heavenly Father’s greatest care package component is described in these words: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,28,"To teach us all that we must do, Jesus Christ led the way by giving the perfect example that we must try to emulate. He pleads with us with arms outstretched to come, follow Him.And when we fail, which we all do, He reminds us, “For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,29,What a wonderful gift! Repentance is not a punishment; it is a privilege. It is a privilege that leads and guides us. No wonder the scriptures declare that we should teach nothing save repentance.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,30,"Heavenly Father has many resources, but often He uses another person to assist Him. Daily He gives us opportunities to lead, guide, and walk beside one in need. We must follow the example of the Savior. We too must be about Heavenly Father’s work."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,31,"As the Young Men General Presidency, we know that youth are blessed when they have parents and leaders who act for Heavenly Father in leading, guiding, and walking beside them. Three principlesthat will help us become part of Heavenly Father’s care package for others are:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,32,"First, be with the youth. President Henry B. Eyring emphasized this point: “There are some things we can do that could matter most. Even more powerful than using words in our teaching the doctrine will be our examples of living the doctrine.”To lead youth requires being with them. Devoted time is an expression of love that allows us to teach by word and example."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,33,"Second, to truly guide youth, we must connect them with heaven. The time always comes when each must stand alone. Only Heavenly Father can be there to guide at all times and in all places. Our youth must know how to seek Heavenly Father’s guidance."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,34,"Third, we must let youth lead. Like the loving parent who holds the hand of a toddler learning to walk, we must let go in order for youth to progress. Letting youth lead requires patience and love. It is harder and takes more time than doing it ourselves. They may stumble along the way, but we walk beside them."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,35,"Brothers and sisters, there will be times in our lives when the blessings of guidance seem distant or lacking. For such times of distress, Elder D. Todd Christofferson promised: “Let your covenants be paramount and let your obedience be exact. Then you can ask in faith, nothing wavering, according to your need, and God will answer. He will sustain you as you work and watch. In His own time and way He will stretch forth His hand to you, saying, ‘Here am I.’”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,36,"At one such time, I sought Heavenly Father’s counsel through constant and heartfelt prayer for more than a year to find the solution to a difficult situation. I knew logically that Heavenly Father answers all sincere prayers. Yet I reached such desperation one day that I attended the temple with one question: “Heavenly Father, do You really care?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,37,"I was sitting near the back of the Logan Utah Temple waiting room when, to my surprise, entering the room that day was the temple president, Vaughn J. Featherstone, a close family friend. He stood at the front of the congregation and welcomed all ofus. When he noticed me among the temple patrons, he stopped speaking, looked me in the eyes, and then said, “Brother Brough, it is good to see you in the temple today.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,38,"I will never forget the feeling of that simple moment. It was as if—in that greeting—Heavenly Father was stretching forth His hand and saying, “Here am I.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,39,"Heavenly Father really does care and listen to and answer every child’s prayer.As one of His children, I know the answer to my prayers came in the Lord’s time. And through that experience, I understood more than ever that we are children of God and that He has sent us here so that we can feel His presence now and return to live with Him someday."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/his-daily-guiding-hand,M. Joseph Brough,40,"I testify that Heavenly Father does lead us, guide us, and walk beside us. As we follow His Son and give heed to His servants, the apostles and prophets, we will find the way to eternal life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,4,"On a Monday evening not long ago, my wife, Lesa, and I stopped by the home of a young family in our neighborhood. While we were there, the family invited us to stay for family home evening, telling us their nine-year-old son had prepared the lesson. Of course we stayed!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,5,"Following the opening song, prayer, and family business, the nine-year-old began by reading an insightful question included in his handwritten lesson: “How does the Holy Ghost help you?” This question began a meaningful family discussion as everyone shared ideas and insights. I was impressed by our teacher’s lesson preparation and his very good question, which stirred in me over and over again."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,6,"Since then, I have continued to ask myself, “How does the Holy Ghost help you?”—a question especially relevant for Primary children turning eight and preparing for baptism and for those children who have recently been baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost. It is also relevant for the thousands of recent converts."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,7,"I invite each of us, especially Primary children, to consider, “How does the Holy Ghost help you?” As I pondered this question, I immediately reflected upon an experience from my youth. This is a story I related to Elder Robert D. Hales shortly after my call to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and which he included in a Church magazine article he wrote about my life.Some of you may have heard this story, but many may not have."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,8,"When I was about 11 years old, my father and I went hiking on a hot summer day in the mountains near our home. As Dad hiked up the steep trail, I jumped from one large rock to another along the sides of the trail. Intending to climb one of the large rocks, I began to clamber to the top of it. As I did so, I was surprised when my dad grabbed me by my belt and quickly pulled me down, saying, “Don’t climb on that rock. Let’s just keep on the trail.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,9,"Minutes later, as we looked down from higher up the trail, we were stunned as we saw a big rattlesnake basking in the sun on top of the very rock I had intended to climb."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,10,"Later, as we were driving home, I knew Dad was waiting for me to ask, “How did you know the snake was there?” So I asked, and my question led to a discussion about the Holy Ghost and how the Holy Ghost can help us. I have never forgotten what I learned that day."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,11,"Can you see how the Holy Ghost helped me? I am forever grateful that my father listened to the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost, as it may have saved my life."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,12,"Before we further consider the question “How does the Holy Ghost help you?” let’s review some of what the Lord has revealed about the HolyGhost. There are many eternal truths we could look at, but today I will highlight just three."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,13,"First, the Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. We learn this truth in the first article of faith: “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,14,"Second, the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, as described in modern scripture: “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.”This means that the Holy Ghost has a spirit body, unlike God the Father and Jesus Christ, who have physical bodies. This truth clarifies other names given to the Holy Ghost and familiar to us, including Holy Spirit, Spirit of God, Spirit of the Lord, Holy Spirit of Promise, and Comforter."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,15,"Third, the gift of the Holy Ghost comes by the laying on of hands. This ordinance, following baptism, qualifies us for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.To perform this ordinance, worthy Melchizedek Priesthood holders place their hands upon the head of the individual,call him or her by name, state their priesthood authority, and in the name of Jesus Christ, confirm him or her a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and utter the important phrase “Receive the Holy Ghost.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,16,"With that simple review of three key truths about the Holy Ghost, we return to our first question: “How does the Holy Ghost help you?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,17,"As I described in my childhood experience, the Holy Ghost can help you by warning you in advance of physical and spiritual dangers. I learned again of the important warning role of the Holy Ghost while I served in the Area Presidency in Japan."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,18,"During this time, I worked closely with President Reid Tateoka of the Japan Sendai Mission. As part of his usual mission routine, President Tateoka planned a meeting for missionary leaders in the southern portion of his mission. A few days prior to the meeting, President Tateoka had an impression, a feeling in his heart, to inviteallmissionaries of that zone to the leadership meeting, instead of the prescribed small number of elder and sister leaders."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,19,"When he announced his intention, he was reminded that this meeting was not designed for all missionaries but only for mission leaders. However, setting convention aside in order to follow the prompting he had received, he invited all missionaries serving in several coastal cities, including the city of Fukushima, to the meeting. On the appointed day, March 11, 2011, the missionaries gathered together forthe expanded mission meeting in the inland city of Koriyama."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,20,"During this meeting a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami struck the region of Japan where the Japan Sendai Mission is located. Tragically, many coastal cities—including those from which the missionaries had been gathered—were devastated and suffered great loss of life. And the city of Fukushima suffered a subsequent nuclear event."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,21,"Although the meetinghouse where the missionaries were meeting that day was damaged by the earthquake, through following the promptings of the Holy Ghost, President and Sister Tateoka and all missionaries were safely assembled. They were out of harm’s way and miles from the devastation of the tsunami and the nuclear fallout."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,22,"As you heed promptings from the Holy Ghost—impressions most often quiet and still—you may be removed, without ever knowing, from spiritual and temporal danger."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,23,"Brothers and sisters, the Holy Ghost will help you by warning you, as He did my father and President Tateoka."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,24,"To continue answering the question “How does the Holy Ghost help you?” let’s now explore His role as Comforter. Unexpected events in all our lives cause sadness, pain, and disappointment. Yet, amid these trials, the Holy Ghost serves us in one of His important roles—as Comforter, which is actually one of His names. These peaceful, reassuring words from Jesus Christ describe this sacred role: “I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,25,"To illustrate this further, I share the true account of a family with five sons who moved from Los Angeles, California, USA, to a small community some years ago. The two oldest sons began playing high school sports and associating with friends, leaders, and coaches—many of whom were faithful members of the Church. These relationships helped lead to the baptism of Fernando, the oldest, and his next younger brother."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,26,"Fernando later moved away from home, where he continued his education and played college football. He married his high school sweetheart, Bayley, in the temple. As Fernando and Bayley finished their schooling, they eagerly anticipated the birth of their first child—a baby girl. But during the process of their families helping to move Fernando and Bayley back home, Bayley and her sister were driving on the freeway and were in a tragic accident involving many vehicles. Bayley and her unborn daughter lost their lives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,27,"Yet as deep as was Fernando’s pain, as well as that of Bayley’s parents and siblings, so too was the depth of contrasting peace and comfort that distilled upon them almost immediately. The Holy Ghost in His role as Comforter truly sustained Fernando through this incomprehensible affliction. The Spirit communicated an abiding peace that led Fernando to an attitude of forgiveness and love toward everyone involved in the tragic crash."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,28,"Bayley’s parents called her brother who was serving as a missionary at the time of the accident. He described in a letter his feelings upon hearing the difficult news of his beloved sister: “It was amazing to hear your voices so calm in the midst of a tempest. I did not know what to say. … All I could think of is my sister may not be there when I come home. … I was comforted by your infallible testimonies of the Savior and His plan. The same sweet spirit that brings me to the verge of tears as I study and teach filled my heart. I was then comforted and reminded of the things that I know.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,29,"The Holy Ghost will help you by comforting you, as He did Fernando and Bayley’s family."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,30,"The Holy Ghost also testifies and bears witness of the Father and the Son and of all truth.The Lord, speaking to His disciples, said, “But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, … he shall testify of me.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,31,"In order to describe the valuable role of the Holy Ghost as witness, I will continue the story of Fernando and Bayley. If you remember, I shared that Fernando and his brother had been baptized, but his parents and three younger brothers had not. And, despite receiving numerous invitations to meetwith the missionaries over the years, each time the family declined."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,32,"Upon the painful passing of Bayley and her baby daughter, Fernando’s family was inconsolable. Unlike Fernando and unlike Bayley’s family, they found no comfort or peace. They could not understand how their own son, along with Bayley’s family, could bear their heavy burden."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,33,"Eventually, they concluded that what their son possessed and they did not was the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and this must be his source of peace and comfort. Following this realization, they invited the missionaries to teach their family the gospel. As a result, they received their own witness and testimony of the great plan of happiness, which brought them the sweet peace and calming comfort they were desperately seeking."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,34,"Two months after the loss of Bayley and their unborn granddaughter, Fernando’s parents as well as two of his younger brothers were baptized and confirmed and received the gift of the Holy Ghost. Fernando’s youngest brother looks forward to his baptism when he turns eight. They each testify that the Spirit, the Holy Ghost, bore witness of the truthfulness of the gospel, leading them to a desire to be baptized and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,35,"Brothers and sisters, the Holy Ghost will help you by testifying to you as He did to Fernando’s family."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,36,"Let’s now summarize. We have identified three revealed truths that bring us to a knowledge of the Holy Ghost. These are that the Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, and the gift of the Holy Ghost comes by the laying on of hands. We also identified three answers to the question “How does the Holy Ghost help you?” The Holy Ghost warns, the Holy Ghost comforts, and the Holy Ghost testifies."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,37,"For those of you who are preparing to be baptized and confirmed, those who recently have been, or even those who were a long time ago, it is vital to our physical and spiritual safety that we keep the gift of the Holy Ghost. We begin to do so by striving to keep the commandments, having individual and family prayer, reading the scriptures, and seeking loving and forgiving relationships with family and loved ones. We should keep our thoughts, actions, and language virtuous. We should worship our Heavenly Father in our homes, at church, and, whenever possible, in the holy temple. Stay close to the Spirit, and the Spirit will stay close to you."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,38,"I now close with an invitation and my sure testimony. I invite you to more fully live the words sung so often by our Primary children, words I am sure they recognize: “Listen, listen. The Holy Ghost will whisper. Listen, listen to the still small voice.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/how-does-the-holy-ghost-help-you,Elder Gary E. Stevenson,39,"My dear brothers and sisters, old and young, I offer my witness of the glorious existence of the divine beings who constitute the Godhead: God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. I bear testimony that one of the privileges we enjoy as Latter-day Saints living in the fulness of times is the gift of the Holy Ghost. I know that the Holy Ghostdoes and willhelp you. I also add my special witness of Jesus Christ and His role as our Savior and Redeemer and of God as our Heavenly Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,13,"The Holy Ghost binds us to the Lord. By divine assignment, He inspires, testifies, teaches, and prompts us to walk in the light of the Lord. We have the sacred responsibility to learn to recognize His influence in our lives and respond."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,14,"Remember the Lord’s promise: “I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy.”I love that assurance. Joy that fills our souls brings with it an eternal perspective in contrast to day-to-day living. That joy comes as peace amidst hardship or heartache. It provides comfort and courage, unfolds the truths of the gospel, and expands our love for the Lord and all God’s children. Although the need for such blessings is so great, in many ways the world has forgotten and forsaken them."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,15,"Each week as we partake of the holy sacrament, we make a covenant to “always remember him,” the Lord Jesus Christ, and His atoning sacrifice. When we keep this sacred covenant, thepromise is given that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us].”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,16,How do we do that?
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,17,"First,we strive to live worthy of the Spirit."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,18,"The Holy Ghost accompanies those who are “strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day.”As the Lord counseled, we must “lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better,”for “the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples.”We must always try to obey God’s laws, study the scriptures, pray, attend the temple, and live true to thethirteenth article of faith, “being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and … doing good to all men.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,19,"Second,we must be willing to receive the Spirit."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,20,"The Lord has promised, “I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.”I began to understand this as a young missionary in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. One hot July morning my companion and I felt prompted to look up a Temple Square referral. We knocked on the door of the Elwood Schaffer home. Mrs. Schaffer politely turned us away."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,21,"As she began to shut the door, I felt to do something I had never done before and have never done since! I stuck my foot in the door, and I asked, “Is there anyone else who might be interested in our message?” Her 16-year-old daughter, Marti, did have an interest and had fervently prayed for guidance just the day before. Marti met with us, and in time her mother participated in the discussions. Both of them joined the Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,22,"Resulting from Marti’s baptism, 136 people, including many of her own family, have been baptized and made gospel covenants. How grateful I am that I listened to the Spirit and stuck my foot in the door on that hot July day. Marti and a number of her dear family members are here today."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,23,"Third,we must recognize the Spirit when it comes."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,24,"My experience has been that the Spirit most often communicates as a feeling. You feel it in words that are familiar to you, that make sense to you, that prompt you. Consider the response of the Nephites as they listened to the Lord pray for them: “And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed.”They felt in their hearts the words of His prayer. The voice of the Holy Spirit is still and small."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,25,"In the Old Testament, Elijah contended with the priests of Baal. The priests expected the “voice” of Baal to come down as thunder and light their sacrifice with fire. But there was no voice, and there was no fire."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,26,"On a later occasion, Elijah prayed. “And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,27,"“And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,28,Do you know that voice?
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,29,"President Monson has taught, “As we pursue the journey of life, let us learn the language of the Spirit.”The Spirit speaks words that we feel. These feelings are gentle, a nudge to act, to do something, to say something, to respond in a certain way. If we are casual or complacent in our worship, drawn off and desensitized by worldly pursuits, we find ourselves diminished in our ability to feel. Nephi said to Laman and Lemuel, “Ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel [the] words.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,30,"Last June, I was on an assignment to South America. We were on a tight 10-day schedule visiting Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. An enormous earthquake had killed hundreds, injured tens of thousands, damaged and destroyed homes and communities in the Ecuadorian cities of Portoviejo and Manta. I felt prompted to add to our schedule a visit to members living in those cities. With damage to the roads, we weren’t sure we could get there. In fact, we had been told we could not get there, but the prompting would not go away. Consequently, we were blessed and were able to visit both cities."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,31,"With such short notice, I expected that only a few local priesthood leaders would attend the hastily organized gatherings. However, we arrived at each stake center to find the chapels filled all the way back to the stage. Some who attended were the stalwarts of the region, the pioneers who had held fast to the Church, encouraging others to join them in worship and to feel the Spirit in their lives. Sitting on the front rows were the members who had lost loved ones and neighbors in the earthquake. I felt prompted to bestow an apostolic blessing upon all who were in attendance, one of my very first given. Though I was standing at the front of that room, it was as if my hands were on each of their heads, and I felt the words of the Lord pouring forth."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,32,"It didn’t end there. I felt prompted to speak to them just as Jesus Christ had done when visiting the people in the Americas. “He took their little children … and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.”We were in Ecuador, we were about our Father’s business, and these were His children."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,33,"Fourth,we must act on thefirstprompting."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,34,"Remember the words of Nephi. “I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless,” he said, “I went forth.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,35,"And so must we. We must be confident in our first promptings. Sometimes we rationalize; we wonder if we arefeeling a spiritual impression or if it is just our own thoughts. When we begin to second-guess, even third-guess, our feelings—and we all have—we are dismissing the Spirit; we are questioning divine counsel. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that if you will listen to the first promptings, you will get it right nine times out of ten."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,36,"Now a caution: don’t expect fireworks because you responded to the Holy Ghost. Remember, you are about the work of the still, small voice."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,37,"While serving as a mission president in New York City, I was with some of our missionaries in a restaurant in the Bronx. A young family came in and sat near us. They appeared golden for the gospel. I watched our missionaries as they continued to visit with me, then noticed as the family concluded their meal and slipped out the door. Then I said, “Elders, there’s a lesson here today. You saw a lovely family come into this restaurant. What should we have done?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,38,"One of the elders spoke up quickly: “I thought about getting up and going over to talk to them. I felt the nudge, but I didn’t respond.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,39,"“Elders,” I said, “we must always act on our first prompting. That nudge you felt was the Holy Ghost!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,40,"First promptings are pure inspiration from heaven. When they confirm or testify to us, we need to recognize them for what they are and never let them slip past. So often, it is the Spirit inspiring us to reach out to someone in need, family and friends in particular. “Thus … the still small voice, which whispereth through and pierceth all things,”points us to opportunities to teach the gospel, to bear testimony of the Restoration and Jesus Christ, to offer support and concern, and to rescue one of God’s precious children."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,41,"Think of it as being what is called a first responder. In most communities the first responders to a tragedy, disaster, or calamity are firefighters, police officers, paramedics. They arrive with lights flashing, and may I add, we are so incredibly grateful for them. The Lord’s way is less obvious but requires just as immediate a response. The Lord knows the needs of all His children—and He knows who is prepared to help. If we let the Lord know in our morning prayers that we are ready, He will call on us to respond. If we respond, He will call on us time and time again and we will find ourselves on what President Monson calls “the Lord’s errand.”We will become spiritual first responders bringing help from on high."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,42,"If we pay attention to the promptings that come to us, we will grow in the spirit of revelation and receive more and more Spirit-driven insight and direction. The Lord has said, “Put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/let-the-holy-spirit-guide,Elder Ronald A. Rasband,43,"May we take seriously the Lord’s call to “be of good cheer, for I will lead you along.”He leads us by the Holy Ghost. May we live close to the Spirit, acting quickly upon our first promptings, knowing they come from God. I bear witness of the power of the Holy Ghost to guide us, guard us, and ever be with us, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

The inspired messages from the powerful sister leaders and the music have fortified our faith and increased our desire to keep the sacred covenants we have made with our loving Heavenly Father. We have felt an increase in our love for the Lord Jesus Christ and an appreciation for the marvelous gift of His atoning sacrifice."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,5,"My message tonight is a simple one. We have all felt peace tonight. All of us would like to feel such peace often within ourselves, in our families, and with the people around us. The Lordpromised peace to His disciples as He was about to leave them. He has made the same promise to us. But He said that He would give peace in His way, not in the world’s way. He described His way of sending peace:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,6,"“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,7,"“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (John 14:26–27)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,8,"The sons of Mosiah needed that gift of peace as they embarked on their mission to the Lamanites. With more than a little anxiety as they sensed the greatness of their task, they prayed for reassurance. And “the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were comforted” (Alma 17:10; see alsoAlma 26:27)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,9,"At times, you may long for peace as you face uncertainty and what seem to you to be looming challenges. The sons of Mosiah learned the lesson that the Lord taught to Moroni. It is a guide for us all: “If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all [who] humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them” (Ether 12:27)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,10,"Moroni said that when he “heard these words,” he “was comforted” (Ether 12:29). They can be a comfort to all of us. Those who do not see their weaknesses do not progress. Your awareness of your weakness is a blessing as it helps you remain humble and keeps you turning to the Savior. The Spirit not only comforts you, but He is also the agent by which the Atonement works a change in your very nature. Then weak things become strong."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,11,You will at times have your faith challenged by Satan; it happens to all disciples of Jesus Christ. Your defense against these attacks is to keep the Holy Ghost as your companion. The Spirit will speak peace to your soul. He will urge you forward in faith. And He will bring back the memory of those times when you felt the light and the love of Jesus Christ.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,12,"Remembering may be one of the most precious gifts the Spirit can give you. He will “bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever [the Lord has] said unto you” (John 14:26). The memory may be of an answered prayer, of a priesthood ordinance received, of a confirmation of your testimony, or of a moment when you saw God’s guiding hand in your life. Perhaps in a future day when you need strength, the Spirit may bring to your memory the feelings you are having during this meeting. I pray that this may be so."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,13,"One memory that the Spirit often brings to my mind is of an evening sacrament meeting held many years ago in a metal shed in Innsbruck, Austria. The shed was under a railroad track. There were only about a dozen people present, sitting on wooden chairs. Most of them were women, some younger and some older. I saw tears of gratitude as the sacrament was passed among the small congregation. I felt the love of the Savior for those Saints, and so did they. But the miracle I remembermost clearly was the light that seemed to fill that metal shed, bringing with it a feeling of peace. It was nighttime and there were no windows, and yet the room was lit as if by noonday sunshine."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,14,"The light of the Holy Spirit was bright and abundant that evening. And the windows that let in the light were the humble hearts of those Saints, who had come before the Lord seeking forgiveness of their sins and committing to always remember Him. It was not hard to remember Him then, and my memory of that sacred experience has made it easier for me to remember Him and His Atonement in the years that have followed. That day the promise in the sacrament prayer that the Spirit will be with us was fulfilled and so brought feelings of light and peace."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,15,"Like you, I have been thankful for the many ways the Lord has visited me with the Comforter when I needed peace. Yet our Father in Heaven is concerned not just about our comfort but even more about our upward progress. “Comforter” is only one of the ways the Holy Ghost is described in the scriptures. Here is another: “And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do good” (D&C 11:12). Most often, the good He will lead you to do will involve helping someone else receive comfort from God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,16,"In His wisdom, the Lord has brought you together in organizations and classes in His Church. He has done so to increase your power to do good. Within these organizations, you have specific charges to serve others for Him. For example, if you are a young woman, you might be asked by your bishop or your Young Women leader to reach out to a Laurel who has become what we sometimes call “less active.” You may know her better than does the bishop or the Young Women leader. You may know that she is feeling troubled at home or at school or perhaps both. Your leaders may not know why they felt impressed to ask you to reach out to her, but the Lord does, and He directs this work through the inspiration of His Spirit."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,17,"Success in your efforts will take a miracle of change both in your heart and in the heart of the young woman you were sent to rescue—and that requires the companionship of the Holy Ghost. The Spirit can allow you to see the less-active Laurel as the Lord sees her. The Lord knows her heart and your heart, and He knows the possibilities of hearts being changed. He can visit you both with His Spirit to inspire humility, forgiveness, and love."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,18,"That Spirit can inspire the words, the deeds, and the patience necessary for you to invite a lamb back to the flock. And He can touch the hearts of the flock in the Laurel class to love and welcome the lost sheep so that when she returns, she will feel she has come home."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,19,"Your power to do good as a group of God’s daughters will depend, to a great degree, on the unity and love that exist among you. This is another gift of peace that comes through the Holy Ghost."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,20,"Alma understood this. That is why he pleaded with his people “that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another” (Mosiah 18:21)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,21,"Unity is necessary for us to have the Spirit in our class and in our family. But you know from experience, as I do, that such loving unity is hard to maintain. It takes having the Holy Ghost as a companion to open our eyes and temper our feelings."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,22,"I remember once a seven- or eight-year-old son of ours jumping on his bed hard enough that I thought it might break. I felt a flash of frustration, and I moved quickly to set my house in order. I grabbed my son by his littleshoulders and lifted him up to where our eyes met."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,23,"The Spirit put words into my mind. It seemed a quiet voice, but it pierced to my heart: “You are holding a great person.” I gently set him back on the bed and apologized."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,24,Now he has become the great man the Holy Ghost let me see 40 years ago. I am eternally grateful that the Lord rescued me from my unkind feelings by sending the Holy Ghost to let me see a child of God as He saw him.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,25,"The unity we seek in our families and in the Church will come as we allow the Holy Ghost to affect what we see when we look at one another—and even when we think of each other. The Spirit sees with the pure love of Christ. Listen to the words Mormon used to describe charity. Think of times you have felt it:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,26,"“Charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,27,"“Wherefore, my beloved brethren [and I add sisters], if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,28,"“But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,29,"“Wherefore, my beloved brethren [and sisters], pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons [and daughters] of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure” (Moroni 7:45–48)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,30,"This is the goal that your Father in Heaven has for you, His precious daughters. It may seem to you like a distant goal, but from His perspective, you’re not that far away. So He visits you with His Spirit to comfort you, encourage you, and inspire you to keep going."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,31,"I leave you my sure witness that the Father knows you—knows your needs and your name—loves you, and hears your prayers. His Beloved Son is inviting you to come unto Him. And They send the Holy Ghost to attend you in your efforts to serve others for Them."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/my-peace-i-leave-with-you,President Henry B. Eyring,32,"Because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost will have a sanctifying and purifying effect on your spirit. You will then feel the peace the Savior promised to leave with His disciples. With that peace will come a bright hope and a feeling of light and love from the Father and His Beloved Son, who leads His kingdom on earth through revelation to His living prophet. I so testify in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,4,"Early in my training as a physician, I had the privilege of helping a young mother deliver her first child. She was calm, focused, and happy. When the baby was delivered, I handed the precious newborn to her. With tears of happiness streaming down her face, she took that brand-new baby into her arms and examined him from head to toe. She held him close and loved him as only a mother can. It was a privilege to be in that room with her."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,5,"Such was the beginning of life for each of us. Yet was our birth truly the beginning? The world sees birth and death as the beginning and the end. But because of God’s holy plan, we know that birth and death are actually just milestones on our journey to eternal life with our Heavenly Father.They are essential parts of our Father’s plan—sacred moments when mortality and heaven intersect. Today, reflecting on what I have learned from observing birth and death through my years of medicalpractice and Church service, I want to testify of our Father’s glorious plan."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,6,"“Before we were born, we lived with God, the Father of our spirits. All [of us] on earth are literally brothers and sisters” in His family,and each of us is precious to Him. We lived with Him for eons of time before our mortal birth—learning, choosing, and preparing."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,7,"Because Heavenly Father loves us, He wants us to have the greatest gift He can give, the gift of eternal life.He could not simply give us this gift; we had to receive it by choosing Him and His ways. This required that we leave His presence and begin a wonderful and challenging journey of faith, growth, and becoming. The journey our Father prepared for us is called the plan of salvation or the plan of happiness."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,8,"In a grand premortal council, our Father told us about His plan.When we understood it, we were so happy that we shouted for joy, and “the morning stars sang together.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,9,"That plan is built upon three grand pillars: the pillars of eternity."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,10,"The first pillar is the Creation of the earth, the setting for our mortal journey."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,11,"The second pillar is the Fall of our first earthly parents, Adam and Eve. Because of the Fall, some marvelous things were given to us. We were able to be born and receive a physical body.I will be forever grateful to my mother for bringing my brothers and me into the world and teaching us about God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,12,"God also gave us moral agency—the ability and privilege of choosing and acting for ourselves.To help us choose well, Heavenly Father gave us commandments. Each day, as we keep His commandments, we show God that we love Him, and He blesses our lives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,13,"Knowing that we would not always choose well—or in other words, sin—Father gave us the third pillar: the Savior Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Through His suffering, Christ paid the price for both physical death and sin.He taught, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,14,"Jesus Christ lived a perfect life, always keeping His Father’s commandments. “He walked the roads of Palestine,” teaching the truths of eternity, “healing the sick, causing the blind to see, and raising the dead.”He “went about doing good”and “entreated all to follow His example.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,15,"At the end of His mortal life, He knelt down and prayed, saying:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,16,"“Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,17,"“And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,18,"Christ helped us better understand the magnitude of His suffering when He told the Prophet Joseph Smith:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,19,"“I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent;"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,20,“But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I;
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,21,"“Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,22,"There in the Garden of Gethsemane, He began to pay the price for our sinsand our sicknesses, our pains and our infirmities.Because He did, we will never be alone in those infirmities if we choose to walk with Him. “He was arrested and condemned on spurious charges, convicted to satisfy a mob, and sentenced to die on Calvary’s cross.” On the cross “He gave [up] His life to atone for the sins of all mankind [in] a great vicarious gift in behalf of all who would ever live upon the earth.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,23,"He declared:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,24,"“Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,25,"“And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,26,"Then, on the first day of the week,He rose from the tomb with a perfect resurrected body, never to die again. And because He did, so will we."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,27,"I testify that Christ did indeed rise from the tomb. But to rise from that tomb, He first had to die. And so must we."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,28,"Another of the great blessings of my life has been to feel the closeness of heaven during those moments when I sit at the bedside of people as they pass away. Early one morning some years ago, I entered the hospital room of a faithful Latter-day Saint widow who had cancer. Two of her daughters were sitting with her. As I went to her bedside, I quickly discovered that she was no longer suffering, because she had just died."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,29,"In that moment of death, the room was filled with peace. Her daughters had a sweet sadness, but their hearts were filled with faith. They knew that their mother was not gone but had returned home.Even in our moments of deepest grief, in the moments when time stands still and life seems so unfair, we can find comfort in our Savior because He suffered as well.It was a privilege for me to be in that room."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,30,"When we die, our spirits leave our bodies, and we go to the next stage of our journey, the spirit world. It is a place of learning, repentance, forgiveness, and becomingwhere we await the Resurrection."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,31,"On some future great day, everyone who has ever been born will rise from the tomb. Our spirits and our physical bodies will be reunited in their perfect form. Everyone will be resurrected, “both old and young, … both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous,” and “every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,32,"After the Resurrection we will have the supreme blessing of being judged by our Savior, who said:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,33,"“I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,34,"“And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,35,"And then, through Christ and His Atonement, all who choose to follow Him through faith, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the endwill find that their journey’s end is to receive “their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.”They will return to their Father’s presence to live with Him forever. May we choose well."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,36,There is so much more to our existence than just what happens between birth and death. I invite you to come and follow Christ.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,37,"I invite all members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to, each day, “come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness, … [that] through the shedding of the blood of Christ, … ye [may] become holy, without spot.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,38,"I invite those who are not yet members of this Church to come and read the Book of Mormon and listen to the missionaries. Come and have faith and repent of your sins. Come and be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. Come and live a happy, Christ-filled life. As you come to Him and keep His commandments, I promise that you can find peace and purpose in this oftentumultuous mortal experience and “eternal life in the world to come.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-fathers-glorious-plan,Elder Weatherford T. Clayton,39,"For those who have experienced these truths and for whatever reason have wandered away, I invite you to come back. Come back today. Our Father and the Savior love you. I testify that Christ has the power to answer your questions, heal your pains and sorrows, and forgive your sins. I know this is true. I know that all these things are true. Christ lives! This is His Church. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,4,"We get a glimpse into our Heavenly Father’s character as we recognize the immense compassion He has for sinners and appreciate the distinction He makes between sin and those who sin. This glimpse helps us have a more “correct [understanding of] his character, perfections, and attributes”and is foundational to exercising faith in Him and in His Son, Jesus Christ. The Savior’s compassion in the face of our imperfections draws us toward Him and motivates us in our repeated struggles to repent and emulate Him. As we become more like Him, we learn to treat others as He does, regardless of any outward characteristic or behavior."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,5,"The impact of distinguishing between the outward characteristics of an individual and the individual himself is central to the novelLes Misérables,by the French author Victor Hugo.As the novel opens, the narrator introducesBienvenu Myriel, the bishop of Digne, and discusses a dilemma facing the bishop. Should he visit a man who is an avowed atheist and is despised in the community because of his past behavior in the French Revolution?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,6,"The narrator states that the bishop could naturally feel a deep aversion for the man. Then the narrator poses a simple question: “All the same, should the scabs of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil?”Answering for the bishop, the narrator provides a definitive answer, “No”—and then adds a humorous comment: “But what a sheep!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,7,"In this passage, Hugo compares the man’s “wickedness” with skin disease in sheep and compares the bishop with a shepherd who does not withdraw when faced with a sheep that is sick. The bishop is sympathetic and later in the novel demonstrates a similar compassion for another man, the main protagonist in the novel, a degraded ex-convict, Jean Valjean. The bishop’s mercy and empathy motivate Jean Valjean to change the course of his life."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,8,"Since God uses disease as a metaphor for sin throughout the scriptures, it is reasonable to ask, “How does Jesus Christ react when faced with our metaphorical diseases—our sins?” After all, the Savior said that He “cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance”;so how can He look at us, imperfect as we are, without recoiling in horror and disgust?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,9,"The answer is simple and clear. As the Good Shepherd,Jesus Christ views disease in His sheep as a condition that needs treatment, care, and compassion. This shepherd, our Good Shepherd, finds joy in seeing His diseased sheep progress toward healing."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,10,"The Savior foretold that He would “feed his flock like a shepherd,”“seek [out] that which [is] lost, … bring again that which [is] driven away, … bind up that which [is] broken, and … strengthen that which [is] sick.”Though apostate Israel was depicted as being consumed with sinful “wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores,”the Savior encouraged, exhorted, and promised healing."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,11,"The Savior’s mortal ministry was indeed characterized by love, compassion, and empathy. He did not disdainfully walk the dusty roads of Galilee and Judea, flinching at the sight of sinners. He did not dodge them in abject horror. No, He ate with them.He helped and blessed, lifted and edified, and replaced fear and despair with hope and joy. Like the true shepherd He is, He seeks us and finds us to offer relief and hope.Understanding His compassion and love helps us exercise faith in Him—to repent and be healed."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,12,"The Gospel of John records the effect of the Savior’s empathy on a sinner. Scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in the very act of adultery to the Savior. The accusers implied that she should be stoned, in compliance with the law of Moses. Jesus, in response to persistent questioning, finally said to them, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,13,"The accusers departed, “and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,14,"“When Jesus … saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,15,"“She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,16,"Surely, the Savior did not condone adultery. But He also did not condemn the woman. He encouraged her to reform her life. She was motivated to change because of His compassion and mercy. The Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible attests to her resultant discipleship: “And the woman glorified God from that hour, and believed on his name.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,17,"While God is empathetic, we should not mistakenly believe that He is accepting and open-minded about sin. He is not. The Savior came to earth to save usfromour sins and, importantly, will not save usinour sins.A skilled interrogator, Zeezrom once tried to trap Amulek by asking: “Shall [the coming Messiah] save his people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word. … He cannot save them in their sins.”Amulek spoke a fundamental truth that to be saved from our sins, we must abide “the conditions of repentance,” which unleash the Redeemer’s power to save our souls."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,18,"The Savior’s compassion, love, and mercy draw us toward Him.Through His Atonement, we are no longer satisfied with our sinful state.God is clear about what is right and acceptable to Him and what is wrong and sinful. This is not because He desires to have mindless, obedient followers. No, our Heavenly Father desires thatHis children knowingly and willingly choose to become like Himand qualify for the kind of life He enjoys.In doing so, His children fulfill their divine destiny and become heirs to all that He has.For this reason, Church leaders cannot alter God’s commandments or doctrine contrary to His will, to be convenient or popular."

Renlund,19,"However, in our lifelong quest to follow Jesus Christ, His example of kindness to those who sin is particularly instructive. We, who are sinners, must, like the Savior, reach out to others with compassion and love. Our role is also to help and bless, lift and edify, and replace fear and despair with hope and joy."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,20,"The Savior rebuked individuals who recoiled from others they viewed as unclean and who self-righteously judged others as more sinful than they.That is the pointed lesson the Savior directed to those who “trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others.” He spoke this parable:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,21,"“Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,22,"“The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,23,"“I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,24,"“And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,25,"Jesus then concluded, “I tell you, this man [the publican] went down to his house justified rather than the other [the Pharisee]: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,26,"The message for us is clear: a repenting sinner draws closer to God than does the self-righteous person who condemns that sinner."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,27,"The human tendency to be self-righteous and judgmental was also present in Alma’s day. As the people “began to establish the church more fully … the church began to wax proud, … the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, … they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,28,"This persecution was specifically prohibited: “Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.”The guiding principle for Latter-day Saints is the same. We must not be guilty of persecuting anyone inside or outside the Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,29,"Those who have been persecuted for any reason know what unfairness and bigotry feel like. As a teenager living in Europe in the 1960s, I felt that I was repeatedly picked on and bullied because I was an American and because I was a member of the Church. Some of my schoolmates treated me as though I were personally responsible for unpopular U.S. foreign policies. I was also treated as though my religion were an affront to the nations in which I lived because it differed from state-sponsored religion. Later, in variouscountries across the world, I have had small glimpses into the ugliness of prejudice and discrimination suffered by those who are targeted because of their race or ethnicity."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,30,"Persecution comes in many forms: ridicule, harassment, bullying, exclusion and isolation, or hatred toward another. We must guard against bigotry that raises its ugly voice toward those who hold different opinions. Bigotry manifests itself, in part, in unwillingness to grant equal freedom of expression.Everyone, including people of religion, has the right to express his or her opinions in the public square. But no one has a license to be hateful toward others as those opinions are expressed."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,31,"Church history gives ample evidence of our members being treated with hatred and bigotry. How ironically sad it would be if we were to treat others as we have been treated. The Savior taught, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”For us to ask for respect, we must be respectful. Furthermore, our genuine conversion brings “meekness, and lowliness of heart,” which invites “the Holy Ghost [and fills us with] perfect love,”an “unfeigned love”for others."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,32,"Our Good Shepherd is unchanging and feels the same way today about sin and sinners as He did when He walked the earth. He does not recoil from us because we sin, even if He on occasion must think, “But what a sheep!” He loves us so much that He provided the way for us to repent and become clean so we can return to Him and our Heavenly Father.In doing so, Jesus Christ also set the example for us to follow—to show respect to all and hatred toward none."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,33,"As His disciples, let us fully mirror His love and love one another so openly and completely that no one feels abandoned, alone, or hopeless. I testify that Jesus Christ is our Good Shepherd, who loves and cares for us. He knows us and laid down His life for His sheep.He also lives for us and wants us to know Him and exercise faith in Him. I love and adore Him, and I am profoundly grateful for Him, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,36,"The novelLes Misérables,by Victor Hugo (1802–85), tells the story of Jean Valjean, who committed a minor crime by stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister’s family. Sentenced to a term of 5 years’ imprisonment, Valjean spent 19 years doing hard labor because of four failed escape attempts. He emerged from prison a hardened and bitter man."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,37,"Because of his criminal record, Valjean was unable to find employment, food, and lodging. Exhausted and demoralized, he was finally given lodging with the bishop of Digne, who showed Valjean kindness and compassion. During the night, Valjean surrendered to a sense of hopelessness and stole the bishop’s silverware and ran away."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/our-good-shepherd,Elder Dale G. Renlund,38,"Valjean was captured and returned to the bishop. Inexplicably and contrary to Valjean’s expectations, the bishop told the police that Valjean had been given the silverware and insisted that Valjean take two silver candlesticks as well. (See Hugo,Les Misérables[1987], book 2, chapters 10–12.)"

This phrase has been translated in various ways into English."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,4,"Many years ago, President David O. McKay told of a beautiful experience he had while sailing on a boat toward Samoa. After falling asleep, he “beheld in vision something infinitely sublime. In the distance,” he said, “I beheld a beautiful white city. … Trees with luscious fruit … and flowers in perfect bloom abounded everywhere. … A great concourse of people [was] approaching the city. Each one wore a white flowing robe. … Instantly my attention … centered upon their leader, and though I could see only the profile of his features … , I recognized him at once as my Savior! The … radiance of his countenance [was] glorious. … [The] peace about him … was divine!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,5,"President McKay continues, “The city … was his … the City Eternal; and the people following him were to abide there in peace and eternal happiness.”"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,11,"For decades, I have remembered the words: “These are they who have overcome the world.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,12,"The blessings that the Lord has promised to those who overcome the world are breathtaking. They will be “clothed in white … and [named in] the book of life.” The Lord “will confess [their names] before [the] Father, and before his angels.”Each shall have “part in the first resurrection,”receive eternal life,and “go no more out”from the presence of God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,13,"Is it possible to overcome the world and receive these blessings? Yes, it is."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,15,"His divine birth, His perfect life, His infinite Atonement at Gethsemane and Golgotha assured the Resurrection of each of us.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,16,"Jesus said, “Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,19,"It can begin as a child learns to pray and reverently sings, “I’m trying to be like Jesus.”It continues as a person studies the life of the Savior in the New Testament and ponders the power of the Savior’s Atonement in the Book of Mormon."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,20,"Praying, repenting, following the Savior, and receiving His grace lead us to better understand why we are here and who we are to become."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,22,"Those overcoming the world know that they will be accountable to their Heavenly Father.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,24,The world is more interested in indulging the natural man than in subduing him.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,25,"Overcoming the world is not a global invasion but a private, personal battle, requiring hand-to-hand combat with our own internal foes."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,26,"Overcoming the world means treasuring the greatest commandment: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,27,"The Christian writer C. S. Lewis described it this way: “Christ says ‘Give me All. I don’t want so much of your time and so much of your money and so much of your work: I want You.’”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L.

Overcoming the world leads us humbly to the sacrament table each week, asking for forgiveness and pledging to “remember him and keep his commandments,” that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us].”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L.

Instead of breathing a sigh of relief when church is over andfrantically running in search of a television before the football game begins, let our focus remain on the Savior and upon His holy day."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,32,"Overcoming the world means turning ourselves outward, remembering the second commandment: “He that is greatest among you shall be your servant.”The happiness of our spouse is more important than our own pleasure. Helping our children to love God and keep His commandments is a primary priority. We willingly share our material blessings through tithing, fast offerings, and giving to those in need. And as our spiritual antennas are pointed heavenward, the Lord guides us to those we can help."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,33,"The world builds its universe around itself, proudly proclaiming: “Look at me compared to my neighbor! Look at what is mine! See how important I am!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,34,"The world is easily irritated, disinterested, and demanding, loving the cheers of the crowd, while overcoming the world brings humility, empathy, patience, and compassion for those different than yourself."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,35,"Overcoming the world will always mean that we will have some beliefs that are ridiculed by the world. The Savior said:"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,40,Overcoming the world is being less concerned with our online connections and more concerned with our heavenly connection to God.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,41,The Lord gives us safety as we heed the guidance from His living prophets and apostles.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,43,"With increasing temptations, distractions, and distortions, the world attempts to beguile the faithful into dismissing the rich spiritual experiences of one’s past, redefining them as foolish deceptions."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,44,"Overcoming the world is remembering, even when we are discouraged, the times we have felt the love and light of the Savior. Elder Neal A. Maxwell explained one of these experiences this way: “I had been blessed, and I knew that God knew that I knew I had been blessed.”Although we may temporarily feel forgotten, we do not forget."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,45,"Overcoming the world does not mean we live a cloistered life, protected from the unfairness and difficulties of mortality. Rather, it opens the more expansive view of faith, drawing us to the Savior and His promises."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,46,"While perfection is not complete in this life, overcoming the world keepsour hope aflame that one day we “shall stand before [our Redeemer]; [and] see his face with pleasure,”and hear His voice: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.”"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,48,"I first met Bruce when we were students at Brigham Young University. He was one of the best and the brightest. After he received his doctoral degree from Harvard University, emphasizing Russian affairs, Bruce’s thinking and writing brought prominence that could have derailed him, but the wealth and praise of the world never clouded his view.His loyalty was to his Savior, Jesus Christ; to his eternal companion, Susan; to his children and grandchildren."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,49,"Bruce was born with a kidney defect. He had surgery, but over time his kidneys continued to decline."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,51,Life for Elder Porter changed dramatically in 1997 when his kidney function and health began to fail. The Porter family returned to Salt Lake City.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,52,"During his 22 years of service in the Seventy, Bruce was hospitalized numerous times, including for 10 surgeries. Doctors told Susan on two occasions that Bruce would not live through the night, but he did."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,53,"For more than 12 years of his service as a General Authority, Bruce was on dialysis to clean his blood. For much of that time, the dialysis consumed five evenings a week for four hours each treatment so that he could serve in his calling during the day and accept conference assignments on the weekends. When his health did not improve after several priesthood blessings, Bruce was puzzled, but he knew in whom he trusted."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,54,"In 2010, Bruce received a kidney from his son David. This time his body did not reject the transplant. It was a miracle, bringing renewed health and eventually allowing him and Susan to return to their beloved Russia, with him serving in the Area Presidency."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,55,"On December 26 of last year, after fighting continuous infections in a hospital in Salt Lake City, he asked the doctors to leave the room. Bruce told Susan “that he knew through the Spirit that there was nothing the doctors could do that would save his life. He knew … that Heavenly Father would take him home. He was filled with peace.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,56,"On December 28, Bruce returned to his family home. A few hours later, surrounded by loved ones, he peacefully returned to his heavenly home."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,57,"Years ago, Bruce Porter wrote these words to his children:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,58,"“The testimony I have of the reality and love of Jesus Christ has been the compass of my life. … It [is] a pure, burning witness of the Spirit that he lives, that he is my Redeemer and Friend in every time of need.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,59,"“Our challenge … is to come to know [the Savior] … and, through faith in him, to overcome the trials and temptations of this world.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,60,"“Let us be faithful and true, trusting in him.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,61,Bruce Douglas Porter overcame the world.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/overcoming-the-world,Elder Neil L. Andersen,62,"May we each try a little harder in our efforts to overcome the world, not excusing serious offenses yet beingpatient with minor slips and falls, eagerly hastening our speed and generously helping others. As you trust more fully in the Savior, I promise you blessings of greater peace in this life and a greater assurance of your eternal destiny, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,5,"I am especially grateful for the presence of our beloved prophet, Thomas S. Monson. President, we will always take to heart your words of direction, counsel, and wisdom. We love you, President Monson, and we always pray for you."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,6,"Years ago, when I was serving as stake president in Frankfurt, Germany, a dear but unhappy sister approached me at the end of one of our stake meetings."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,7,“Isn’t it terrible?” she said. “There must have been four or five people sound asleep during your talk!”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,8,"I thought for a moment and answered, “I am pretty sure that church sleep is among the healthiest of all sleeps.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,9,"My wonderful wife, Harriet, overheard this casual exchange and later mentioned that it was one of the nicest answers I had ever given."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,10,"A few hundred years ago in North America, a movement called the “Great Awakening” spread across the countryside. One of its primary objectives was to awaken the people who appeared to be asleep regarding spiritual matters."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,11,Young Joseph Smith was influenced by the things he heard from preachers who were part of this religious awakening. It is one of the reasons he decided to seek earnestly the will of the Lord in private prayer.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,12,"These preachers had a dramatic, emotional preaching style, with sermons that were known for their heavy emphasis on the fiery terrors of hell that await the sinner.Their speeches didn’t put people to sleep—but they may have caused a few nightmares. Their purpose and pattern seemed to be to frighten people into church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,13,"Historically, fear has often been used as a means to get people to take action. Parents have used it with their children, employers with employees, and politicians with voters."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,14,"Experts in marketing understand the power of fear and often employ it. This is why some advertisements seem to carry the implicit message that if we fail to buy their breakfast cereal or miss out on the newest video game or cell phone, we run the risk of living a miserable life, dying alone and unhappy."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,15,"We smile at this and think we would never fall for such manipulation, but we sometimes do. Worse, we sometimes use similar methods to get others to do what we want."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,16,"My message has two purposes today: The first is to urge us to contemplate and consider the extent to whichweuse fear to motivateothers—including ourselves. The second is to suggest a better way."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,17,"First, let us address the problem with fear. After all, who among us has never been compelled by fear to eat better, wear a seat belt, exercise more, save money, or even repent of sin?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,18,"It is true that fear can have a powerful influence over our actions and behavior. But that influence tends to be temporary and shallow. Fear rarely has the power to change our hearts, and it will never transform us into people who love what is right and who want to obey Heavenly Father."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,19,"People who are fearful maysayand do the right things, but they do notfeelthe right things. They often feel helpless and resentful, even angry. Over time these feelings lead to mistrust, defiance, even rebellion."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,20,"Unfortunately, this misguided approach to life and leadership is not limited to the secular world. It grieves me to hear of Church members who exercise unrighteous dominion—whether in their homes, in their Church callings, at work, or in their daily interactions with others."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,21,"Often, people may condemn bullying in others, yet they cannot see it in themselves. They demand compliance with their own arbitrary rules, but when others don’t follow these random rules, they chasten them verbally, emotionally, and sometimes even physically."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,22,"The Lord has said that “when we … exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, … the heavens withdraw themselves [and] the Spirit of the Lord is grieved.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,23,"There may be moments when we are tempted to justify our actions by believing that the end justifies the means. We might even think that to be controlling, manipulative, and harsh will be for the good of others. Not so, for the Lord has made it clear that “the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, [and] temperance.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,24,"The more I come to know my Heavenly Father, the more I see how He inspires and leads His children. He is not angry, vengeful, or retaliatory.His very purpose—His work and His glory—is to mentor us, exalt us, and lead us to His fulness."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,25,"God described Himself to Moses as “merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,26,"Our Father in Heaven’s love for us, His children, surpasses by far our ability to comprehend."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,27,"Does this mean that God condones or overlooks behaviors that run contrary to His commands? No, definitely not!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,28,But He wants to change more than just our behaviors. He wants to change our very natures. He wants to change our hearts.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,29,"He wants us to reach out and take firm hold of the iron rod, confront our fears, and bravely step forward and upward along the strait and narrow path. He wants this for us because He loves us and because this is the way to happiness."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,30,"So, how does God motivate His children to follow Him in our day?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,31,He sent His Son!
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,32,"God sent His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to show us the right way."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,33,"God motivates through persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned.God is on our side. He loves us, and when we stumble, He wants us to rise up, try again, and become stronger."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,34,He is our mentor.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,35,He is our great and cherished hope.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,36,He desires to stimulate us with faith.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,37,He trusts us to learn from our missteps and make correct choices.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,38,This is the better way!
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,39,One of the ways Satan wants us to manipulate others is by dwelling upon and even exaggerating the evil in the world.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,40,"Certainly our world has always been, and will continue to be, imperfect. Far too many innocent people suffer because of circumstances of natureas well as from man’s inhumanity. The corruption and wickedness in our day are unique and alarming."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,41,"But in spite of all this, I wouldn’t trade living in this time with any other time in the history of the world. We are blessed beyond measure to live in a day of unparalleled prosperity, enlightenment, and advantage. Most of all, we are blessed to have the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which gives us a unique perspective on the world’s dangers and shows us how to either avoid these dangers or deal with them."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,42,"When I think of these blessings, I want to fall to my knees and offer praises to our Heavenly Father for His never-ending love for all of His children."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,43,"I don’t believe God wants His children to be fearful or dwell on the evils of the world. “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,44,"He has given us an abundance of reasons to rejoice. We just need to find and to recognize them. The Lord often reminds us to “be not afraid,” to “be of good cheer,”and to “fear not, little flock.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,45,"Brothers and sisters, we are the Lord’s “little flock.” We are the Saints of the latter days. Inherent in our name is the commitment to look forward to the Savior’s return and prepare ourselves and the world to receive Him. Therefore, let us serve God and love our fellowmen. Let us do this with a natural confidence, with humility, never looking down on any other religion or group of people. Brothers and sisters, we are charged with studying the word of God and heeding the voice of the Spirit, that we may “know the signs of the times, and the signs of the coming of the Son of Man.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,46,"We are, therefore, not ignorant of the challenges of the world, nor are we unaware of the difficulties of our times. But this does not mean that we should burden ourselves or others with constant fear. Rather than dwelling on the immensity of our challenges, would it not be better to focus on the infinite greatness, goodness, and absolute power of our God, trusting Him and preparing with a joyful heart for the return of Jesus the Christ?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,47,"As His covenant people, we need not be paralyzed by fear because bad things might happen. Instead, we can move forward with faith, courage, determination, and trust in God as we approach the challenges and opportunities ahead."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,48,"We do not walk the path of discipleship alone. “The Lord thy God … doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,49,"“The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,50,"In the face of fear, let us find our courage, muster our faith, and have confidence in the promise that “no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,51,Do we live in a time of peril and turmoil? Of course we do.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,52,"God Himself has said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,53,Can we exercise the faith to believe and to act accordingly? Can we live up to our commitments and sacred covenants? Can we keep the commandments of God even in challenging circumstances? Of course we can!
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,54,"We can because God has promised, “All things shall work together foryour good, if [you] walk uprightly.”Therefore, let us set aside our fears and live instead with joy, humility, hope, and a bold confidence that the Lord is with us."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,55,"My beloved friends, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, if we ever find ourselves living in fear or anxiety, or if we ever find that our own words, attitudes, or actions are causing fear in others, I pray with all the strength of my soul that we may become liberated from this fear by the divinely appointed antidote to fear: the pure love of Christ, for “perfect love casteth out fear.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,56,"Christ’s perfect love overcomes temptations to harm, coerce, bully, or oppress."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,57,"Christ’s perfect love allows us to walk with humility, dignity, and a bold confidence as followers of our beloved Savior. Christ’s perfect love gives us the confidence to press through our fears and place our complete trust in the power and goodness of our Heavenly Father and of His Son, Jesus Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,58,"In our homes, in our places of business, in our Church callings, in our hearts, let us replace fear with Christ’s perfect love. Christ’s love will replace fear with faith!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,59,"His love will enable us to recognize, trust, and have faith in our Heavenly Father’s goodness, His divine plan, His gospel, and His commandments.Loving God and our fellowmen will turn our obedience to God’s commandments into a blessing rather than a burden. Christ’s love will help us become a little kinder, more forgiving, more caring, and more dedicated to His work."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,60,"As we fill our hearts with the love of Christ, we will awaken with a renewed spiritual freshness and we will walk joyfully, confidently, awake, and alive in the light and glory of our beloved Savior, Jesus Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,61,"I testify, with the Apostle John, “There is no fear in [Christ’s] love.”Brothers and sisters, dear friends, God knows you perfectly. He loves you perfectly. He knows what your future holds. He wants you to “be not afraid, only believe”and “abide in his [perfect] love.”This is my prayer and blessing in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

Uchtdorf,66,"On one occasion, the Savior wanted to enter a village of the Samaritans, but the people rejected Jesus and would not receive Him into their village. Two of His disciples were deeply offended by this and asked, “Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” Jesus answered with this caution: “You do not know what manner of spirit you are of. For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them” (see Luke 9:51–56, New King James Version [1982])."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,71,"The premortal Council in Heaven is an excellent case study that demonstrates the character of God. There our Heavenly Father presented His plan for our eternal progression. Key elements of that plan included agency, obedience, and salvation through the Atonement of Christ. Lucifer, however, proposed a different approach. He guaranteed that all would obey—none would be lost. The only way to accomplish this would be through tyranny and force. But our loving Heavenly Father would not permit such a plan. He valued the agency of His children. He knew that we must make mistakes along the way if we are to truly learn. And that is why He provided a Savior, whose eternal sacrifice could cleanse us of sin and permit our entry back into the kingdom of God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/perfect-love-casteth-out-fear,President Dieter F.

Did He intimidate or threaten those who were making such a terrible choice? No. Our all-powerful God could surely have stopped this rebellion. He could have forced His will upon the dissenters and made them comply. But instead, He allowed His children to choose for themselves."

One day the company president, a good man of another faith, called me into his office. His question startled me: “I just learned you are a priest in your church. Is that true?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,5,"I replied, “Yes, that is correct. I hold the priesthood.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,6,"Visibly intrigued by my response, he further inquired, “But did you study at a theological seminary?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,7,"“Of course,” I answered, “between the ages of 14 and 18, and I studied seminary lessons nearly every day!” He almost fell off his chair."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,8,"To my great surprise, several weeks later he called me back to his office to offer me a managing director position in one of the group’s companies. I was astonished and expressed my concern that I was too young and inexperienced to hold such an important responsibility. With a benevolent smile, he said, “That may be true, but it doesn’t matter. I know your principles, and I know what you’ve learned in your church. I need you.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,9,"He was right about what I had learned in the Church. The years that followed were challenging, and I don’t know if I could have had any success without the experience I acquired by serving in the Church from the time I was a young man."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,10,"I had the blessing of growing up in a small branch. Because our numbers were few, the youth were called upon to actively participate in all aspects of the branch. I was very busy and loved feeling useful. On Sundays I officiated at the sacrament table, served in my priesthood quorum, and functioned in various other callings. During the week I often accompanied my father and other adult priesthood holders as we home taught members, comforted the sick and afflicted, and helped those in need. No one seemed to think I was too young to serve or even to lead. For me, it all seemed normal and natural."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,11,"The service I rendered during those teenage years helped me build my testimony and anchor my life in the gospel. I was surrounded by good and compassionate men who were committed to using their priesthood to bless the lives of others. I wanted to be like them. In serving with them, much more than I realized at the time, I learned to be a leader in the Church and also in the world."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,12,"We have many young men attending or tuning in to this meeting tonightwho hold the Aaronic Priesthood. As I look out at this audience, I see many of you sitting next to mature men, perhaps your fathers, your grandfathers, your older brothers, or your priesthood leaders—all holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood. They love you, and in large part, they came here tonight to be with you."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,13,"This gathering of generations offers a marvelous vision of the unity and brotherhood that exist between the two priesthoods of God. Even though they are vested with different missions and authority, the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood are inseparable partners in the work of salvation. They go hand in hand and have great need of each other."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,14,The perfect model of the close relationship that exists between the two priesthoods is found in the interaction between Jesus and John the Baptist. Can one possibly imagine John the Baptist without Jesus? What would the Savior’s mission have been like without the preparatory work performed by John?
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,15,"John the Baptist was given one of the most noble missions to ever exist: “to prepare the way of the Lord,”to baptize Him with water, and to make ready a people to receive Him. This “just … and … holy [man],”who had been ordained to the lesser priesthood, was perfectly aware of both the importance and the limits of his mission and his authority."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,16,"People flocked to John to hear him and be baptized by him. He was honored and revered in his own right as a man of God. But when Jesus appeared, John humbly deferred to One greater than himself and declared, “I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, … who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,17,"For His part, Jesus the Christ, the Only Begotten of the Father, who held the higher priesthood, humbly recognized the authority of John. Of him, the Savior said, “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,18,"Just think of what would take place in our priesthood quorums if the relationships between the holders of the two priesthoods were inspired by the pattern established by Jesus and John the Baptist. My young brethren of the Aaronic Priesthood, like John’s, your role is to “prepare the way”for the great work of the Melchizedek Priesthood. You are doing this in many different ways. You administer the ordinances of baptism and of the sacrament. You help prepare a people for the Lord by preaching the gospel, by “[visiting] the house of each member,”and by “[watching] over the church.”You provide assistance to the poor and needy by collecting fast offerings, and you participate in taking care of Church meetinghouses and other temporal resources. Your role is important, needful, and sacred."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,19,"My adult brethren, whether you are fathers, bishops, Young Men advisers,or simply holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood, you can follow the Savior’s example by turning to your brothers who hold the lesser priesthood and inviting them to labor with you. In reality, this invitation comes from the Lord Himself. He said, “Therefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the lesser priesthood, and send them before you to make appointments, and to prepare the way, and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,20,"As you invite your younger brothers to “prepare the way,” you help them recognize and honor the sacred authority they hold. By doing so, you help them prepare their own way as they prepare for the day that they receive and exercise the higher priesthood."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,21,"Allow me to share the true story of Alex, a quiet, thoughtful, and bright young priest. One Sunday, Alex’s bishop found him alone in a classroom in a state of great distress. The young man explained how painfully difficult it was for him to attend church without his father, who was not a member. Then he tearfully said it would probably be better for him to leave the Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,22,"With genuine concern for this young man, the bishop immediately mobilized the ward council to help Alex. His plan was simple: to keep Alex active and help him develop a heartfelt testimony of the gospel, they needed to “surround him with good people and give him important things to do.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,23,"Quickly the priesthood brethren and all the ward members rallied around Alex and expressed their affection and support. The high priests group leader, a man of great faith and love, was chosen to be his home teaching companion. Members of the bishopric took him under their wings and made him their closest associate."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,24,"The bishop said: “We kept Alex busy. He ushered at weddings, ushered at funerals, assisted me at graveside dedications, baptized several new members, ordained young men to Aaronic Priesthood offices, taught youth lessons, taught with the missionaries, unlocked the building for conferences, and locked up the building late at night after conferences. He did service projects, accompanied me on visits to elderly members in hospices, gave talks in sacrament meeting, administered the sacrament to the sick in hospitals or in their homes, and became one of only a very small handful of people that I could totally rely on as bishop.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,25,"Little by little, Alex changed. His faith in the Lord increased. He gained confidence in himself and in the power of the priesthood that he held. The bishop concluded: “Alex has been and will always be one of my greatest blessings in my time as bishop. What a privilege it has been to associate with him. I genuinely believe that no young man has ever gone into the mission field more prepared by his priesthood service.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,26,"My dear bishops, you have, included in your ordination and setting apart as bishop of your ward, the sacred calling to serve as president of the Aaronic Priesthood and of the priests quorum. I am aware of the heavy burdens you carry, but you should make your duty toward these young men one of your highest priorities. You cannot neglect it or delegate your role in this responsibility to others."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,27,"I invite you to reflect upon each of the young Aaronic Priesthood holders in your ward. Not one of them should ever feel left out or useless. Is there a young man whom you and other priesthood brethren could help? Invite him to serve alongside you. Too oftenwe try to entertain our young men and relegate them to a spectator role, when their faith and love for the gospel can be best developed by magnifying their priesthood. By actively participating in the work of salvation, they will be connected with heaven and they will gain awareness of their divine potential."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,28,"The Aaronic Priesthood is more than just an age group, a teaching or activity program, or even a term to designate the young men of the Church. It is power and authority to participate in the great work of saving souls—both the souls of those young men who hold it and the souls of those they serve. Let us put the Aaronic Priesthood in its rightful place, a choice place—a place of service, preparation, and accomplishment for all the young men of the Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/prepare-the-way,Bishop Gérald Caussé,29,"My dear brethren of the Melchizedek Priesthood, I invite you to strengthen the essential link that unites the two priesthoods of God. Empower your Aaronic Priesthood youth to prepare the way before you. Tell them with confidence, “I need you.” To you young holders of the Aaronic Priesthood, I pray that, as you serve with your older brethren, you will hear the voice of the Lord telling you: “Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great things. Behold thou wast sent forth, even as John, to prepare the way before me.”In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,5,"Over the years, I have observed that those who accomplish the most in this world are those with a vision for their lives, with goals to keep them focused on their vision and tactical plans for how to achieve them. Knowing where you are going and how you expect to get there can bring meaning, purpose, and accomplishment to life."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,6,"Some have difficulty differentiating between a goal and a plan until they learn that a goal is a destination or anend,while a plan is the route by which you get there. For example, we can have a goal to drive to a certain unfamiliar location, and as some of you dear sisters know, we men often think we know how to get there—often resulting in our saying, “I know it must be just around the next corner.” My wife must be smiling. The goal was clear, but there wasn’t a good plan in place to reach the destination."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,7,"Goal setting is essentially beginning with the end in mind. And planningis devising a way to get to that end. A key to happiness lies in understanding what destinations truly matter—and then spending our time, effort, and attention on the things that constitute a sure way to arrive there."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,8,"God, our Heavenly Father, has given us the perfect example of goal setting and planning. His goal is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man [and woman],”and His means to achieve it is the plan of salvation."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,9,"Our beloved Heavenly Father’s plan includes giving us a growing, stretching, learning, physical mortality through which we can become more like Him. Clothing our eternal spirits in physical bodies; living by the teachings and commandments of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ; and forming eternal families allows us, through the Savior’s Atonement, to fulfill God’s goal of immortality and eternal life for His children with Him in His celestial kingdom."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,10,"Wise goal setting includes the understanding that short-term goals are only effective if they lead to clearly understood longer-term goals. I believe that one important key to happiness is to learn how to set our own goals and establish our own plans within the framework of our Heavenly Father’s eternal plan. If we focus on this eternal path, we will inevitably qualify to return to His presence."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,11,"It is good to have goals and plans for our careers, for our education, even for our golf game. It is also important to have goals for our marriages, our families, and our Church councils and callings; this is especially true for missionaries. But our greatest and most overriding goals should fit into Heavenly Father’s eternal plan. Jesus said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,12,"Experts on goal setting tell us that the simpler and more straightforward a goal is, the more power it will have. When we can reduce a goal to one clear image or one or two powerful and symbolic words, that goal can then become part of us and guide virtually everything we think and do. I believe that there are two words that, in this context, symbolize God’s goals for us and our most important goals for ourselves. The words arereturnandreceive."

In fact, Lucifer rebelled and attempted to completely modify our Father’s plan, wanting to take the glory, honor, and power of God to himself. As a result, he was cast out with his minions from God’s presence and “became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men [and women], and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto [the Lord’s] voice.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,16,"Because of his premortal choices, Satan can neitherreturnnorreceive.The only thing left for him is to oppose the Father’s plan by using every possible enticement and temptation to bring us down and make us miserable like unto himself.Satan’s plan to accomplish his diabolical goal applies to every individual, generation, culture, and society.

And if that sounds unusual, think about it: who in this world knows you better than you know yourself? You know your thoughts, your private actions, your desires, and your dreams, goals, and plans. And you know better than anyone how you are progressing along the road toreturningandreceiving."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,21,"As a guide for me during this private, personal review, I like to read and ponder the introspective words found in thefifth chapter of Alma, wherein Alma asks: “Have ye spiritually been born of God?

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,25,"During the coming weeks, find time to review your life’s goals and your plans, and make sure they align with our Heavenly Father’s great plan for our happiness. If you need to repent and change, then consider doing so now. Take the time to prayerfully think about what adjustments are needed to help you keep your “eye single to the glory of God.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,26,"We must keep the doctrine and gospel of Jesus Christ at the center of our goals and plans. Without Him, no eternal goal is possible, and our plans to achieve our eternal goals will surely fail."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,27,"One additional help is “The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles,”which was presented to the Church on January 1, 2000. Place a copy where you can see it, and take time to review each of the statements found in this inspired testimony of Christ by His special witnesses who signed it."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,28,"I would urge you to study it along with “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” We speak often about the family proclamation, but pleaseremember to read it in light of the saving power of the living Christ. Without the living Christ, our fondest expectations will be unfulfilled. As the family proclamation states: “The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,29,This can happen only because the living Christ is the atoning Savior and Redeemer of the world.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,30,"In this regard, you may also consider searching the scriptures to expand your understanding of the specific truths found in “The Living Christ.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,31,"Prayerfully reading “The Living Christ” is like reading the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and the prophets of the Book of Mormon. It will increase your faith in the Savior and help you stay focused on Him as you follow your plans to reach your eternal goals."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,32,"Despite our mistakes, shortcomings, detours, and sins, Jesus Christ’s Atonement allows us to repent, prepared toreturnandreceivethe matchless blessings God has promised—to live forever with the Father and the Son in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,33,"Now as you all know, no one will escape death; therefore, our long-term goal and plan should be that when wereturnto our Heavenly Father, we willreceiveall that He has planned for each one of us."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,34,"I testify there is no greater goal in mortality than to live eternally with our Heavenly Parents and our beloved Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. But it is more than justourgoal—it is alsoTheirgoal. They have a perfect love for us, more powerful than we can even begin to comprehend. They are totally, completely, eternally aligned with us. We are Their work. Our glory is Their glory. More than anything else, They want us to come home—toreturnandreceiveeternal happiness in Their presence."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,35,"My dear brothers and sisters, in one week, we will celebrate Palm Sunday—commemorating Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem. In two weeks, we will celebrate Easter Sunday—commemorating the Savior’s triumph over death."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/return-and-receive,Elder M. Russell Ballard,36,"As we focus our attention on the Savior during these two special Sundays, let us remember Him and renew our lifelong commitment to keeping His commandments. Let us look deeply into our own lives, setting our own goals and focusing our plans to align with God’s in a way that will ultimately lead us toward our precious privilege toreturnandreceive—which is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,4,"“There is sunshine in my soul today,” Eliza Hewitt wrote, “more glorious and bright than glows in any earthly sky, for Jesus is my light.”With radiance in every note, that marvelous old Christian hymn is virtually impossible to sing without smiling. But today I wish to lift out of context just one line from it that may help on days when we find it hard to singorsmile and “peaceful happy moments” donotseem to “roll.” If for a time you are unable to echo the joyous melodies you hear coming from others, I ask you to hold tenaciously to the line in this hymn that reassures, “Jesus listening can hear the songs [you] cannot sing.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,5,"Among the realities we face as children of God living in a fallen world is that some days are difficult, days when our faith and our fortitude are tested. These challenges may come from a lack in us, a lack in others, or just a lack in life, but whatever the reasons, we find they can rob us of songs we so much want to sing and darken the promise of “springtime in [the] soul”that Eliza Hewitt celebrates in one of her verses."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,6,"So what do we do in such times? For one thing, we embrace the Apostle Paul’s counsel and “hope for that [which] we see not … [and] with patience wait for it.”In those moments when the melody of joy falters below our power of expression, we may have to stand silent for a time and simply listen to others, drawing strength from the splendor of the music around us. Many of us who are “musically challenged” have had our confidence bolstered and our singing markedly improved by positioning ourselves next to someone with a stronger, more certain voice. Surely it follows that in singing the anthems of eternity, we should stand as close as humanly possible to the Savior and Redeemer of the world—who has absolutely perfect pitch. We then take courage from His ability to hear our silence and take hope from His melodious messianic intercession in our behalf. Truly it is “when the Lord is near” that “the dove of peace sings in my heart [and] the flow’rs of grace appear.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,7,"On those days when we feel a little out of tune, a little less than what we think we see or hear in others, I would ask us, especially the youth of the Church, to remember it is by divine design that not all the voices in God’s choir are the same. It takes variety—sopranos and altos, baritones and basses—to make rich music. To borrow a line quoted in the cheery correspondence of two remarkable Latter-day Saint women, “All God’s critters got a place in the choir.”When we disparage our uniqueness or try to conform to fictitious stereotypes—stereotypes driven by an insatiable consumer culture and idealized beyond any possible realization by social media—we lose the richness of tone and timbre that God intended when He created a world of diversity."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,8,"Now, this is not to say that everyone in this divine chorus can simplystart shouting his or her own personal oratorio! Diversity is not cacophony, and choirs do require discipline—for our purpose today, Elder Hales, I would say discipleship—but once we have accepted divinely revealed lyrics and harmonious orchestration composed before the world was, then our Heavenly Father delights to have us sing in our own voice, not someone else’s. Believe in yourself, and believe in Him. Don’t demean your worth or denigrate your contribution. Above all, don’t abandon your role in the chorus. Why? Because you are unique; you are irreplaceable. The loss of even one voice diminishes every other singer in this great mortal choir of ours, including the loss of those who feel they are on the margins of society or the margins of the Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,9,"But even as I encourage all ofyouto have faith regarding songs that may be difficult to sing, I readily acknowledge that for different reasonsIstruggle with other kinds of songs that should be—but are not yet—sung."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,10,"When I see the staggering economic inequality in the world, I feel guilty singing with Mrs. Hewitt of “blessings which [God] gives me now [and] joys ‘laid up’ above.”That chorus cannot be fully, faithfully sung until we have honorably cared for the poor. Economic deprivation is a curse that keeps on cursing, year after year and generation after generation. It damages bodies, maims spirits, harms families, and destroys dreams. If we could do more to alleviate poverty, as Jesus repeatedly commands us to do, maybe some of the less fortunate in the world could hum a few notes of “There Is Sunshine in My Soul Today,” perhaps for the first time in their lives."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,11,"I also find it hard to sing sunny, bouncy lyrics when so many around us suffer from mental and emotional illness or other debilitating health limitations. Unfortunately, these burdens sometimes persist despite the valiant efforts of many kinds of caregivers, including family members. I pray we will not let these children of God suffer in silence and that we will be endowed with His capacity to hear the songs they cannot now sing."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,12,"And someday I hope a great global chorus will harmonize across all racial and ethnic lines, declaring that guns, slurs, and vitriol arenotthe way to deal with human conflict. The declarations of heaven cry out to us that the onlyway complex societal issues can ever be satisfactorily resolved is by loving God and keeping His commandments, thus opening the door to the one lasting, salvific way to love each other as neighbors. The prophet Ether taught that we should “hope for a better world.” Reading that thought a thousand years later, war- and violence-weary Moroni declared that the “more excellent way” to that world will always be the gospel of Jesus Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,13,"How grateful we are that in the midst of these kinds of challenges, there comes, from time to time, another kind of song that we find ourselves unable to sing, but for a different reason. This is when feelings are so deep and personal, even so sacred, that they either cannot be or should not be expressed—like Cordelia’s love for her father, of which she said: “My love’s … richer than my tongue. … I cannot heave my heart into my mouth.”Coming to us as something holy, these sentiments are simply unutterable—spiritually ineffable—like the prayer Jesus offered for the Nephite children. Those who were witnesses to that event recorded:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,14,"“Eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard … so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,15,"“…No tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,16,"These kinds of sanctified moments remain unuttered because expression, even if it were possible, might seem like desecration."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,17,"Brothers and sisters, we live in a mortal world with many songs we cannot or do not yet sing. But I plead with each one of us to stay permanently and faithfully in the choir, where we will be able to savor forever that most precious anthem of all—“the song of redeeming love.”Fortunately, the seats for this particular number are limitless. There is room for those who speak different languages, celebrate diverse cultures, and live in a host of locations. There is room for the single, for the married, for large families, and for the childless. There is room for those who once had questions regarding their faith and room for those who still do. There is room for those with differing sexual attractions. In short, there is a place for everyone who loves God and honors His commandments as the inviolable measuring rod for personal behavior, for if love of God is the melody of our shared song, surely our common quest to obey Him is the indispensable harmony in it. With divine imperatives of love and faith, repentance and compassion, honesty and forgiveness, there is room in this choir for all who wish to be there.“Come as you are,” a loving Father says to each of us, but He adds, “Don’t plan to stay as you are.” We smile and remember that God is determined to make of us more than we thought we could be."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,18,"In this great oratorio that is His plan for our exaltation, may we humbly follow His baton and keep working on the songs we cannot sing, until we can offer those “carol[s] to [our] King.”Then one day, as our much-loved hymn says:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,19,"We’ll sing and we’ll shout with the armies of heaven,"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,20,"Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb! …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,21,… As Jesus descends with his chariot of fire!
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung,Elder Jeffrey R. Holland,22,"I testify that hour will come, that God our Eternal Father will again send to earth His Only Begotten Son, this time to rule and reign as King of kings forever. I testify that this is His restored Church and is the vehicle for bringing the teachings and saving ordinances of His gospel to all humankind. When His message “has penetrated every continent [and] visited every clime,”Jesus will indeed “[show] his smiling face.”There will be plenty of eternal sunshine for the soul that day. For this promised hour to come, I longingly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

When we are partially in or not in at all, there is, in theStar Warsvernacular, “a disturbance in the force.” We are out of sync with God’s will and therefore out of sync with the nature of happiness.Isaiah said:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,26,"“The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,27,"“There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,28,"Fortunately, no matter where we are or where we have been, we are not beyond the reach of the Savior, who said: “Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,29,"As we continually repent and rely upon the Lord, we gain strength as we come full circle in possessing the humility and faith of a little child,enriched with the wisdom borne from a life of experience. Job proclaimed, “The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.”It was Tennyson who wrote, “My strength is as the strength of ten, because my heart is pure.”The Lord has counseled, “Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,30,"Our son Justin passed away at age 19 after fighting a lifelong disease. In a sacrament meeting talk he gave not long before he left us, he shared a story that must have resonated with him about a father and his young son who went into a toy store where there was an inflatable punching bag in the shape of a man. The boy punched the inflatable man, who tipped over and immediately bounced back after every punch. The father asked his young son why the man kept bouncing back up. The boy thought for a minute and then said, “I don’t know. I guess it’s because he’s standing up on the inside.” In order to be “all in,” we need to “stand up inside,” “come what may.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,31,"We stand up inside when we wait patiently upon the Lord to remove or give us strength to endure our thorns in the flesh.Such thorns may be disease, disability, mental illness, death of a loved one, and so many other issues."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,32,"We stand up inside when we lift up the hands that hang down. We stand up inside when we defend the truth against a wicked and secular world that is becoming increasingly more uncomfortable with light, calling evil good and good eviland “condemning the righteous because of their righteousness.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,33,"Standing up inside in spite of difficulties is possible because of a clear conscience, the strengthening and comforting assurance from the Holy Ghost, and an eternal perspective which surpasses mortal understanding.In our premortal life we shouted for joy at the opportunity to experience mortality.We were “all in” as we excitedly made the decision to be valiant defenders of our Heavenly Father’s plan. It is time to stand up and defend His plan again!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,34,"My 97-year-old father recently passed away. Whenever someoneasked him how he was doing, his consistent reply was “On a scale of 1–10, I’m about a 25!” Even when this dear man could no longer stand or even sit and had great difficulty speaking, his answer was still the same. He was always standing up inside."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,35,"When my dad was 90, we were in an airport and I asked him if I could get him a wheelchair. He said, “No, Gary—maybe when I get old.” And then he added, “Besides, if I get tired of walking, I can always run.” If we are not able to be “all in” the way we are presently walking, then maybe we need to run; maybe we need to recalculate our route. We might even need to make a U-turn. We might need to study more intently, pray more earnestly, or just let some things go so we can hang on to those things that really matter. We may need to let go of the world so we can hang on to eternity. My father understood this."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,36,"When he was in the navy during World War II, there were those in the great and spacious buildingwho made fun of his principles, but two of his shipmates, Dale Maddox and Don Davidson, took note and did not. They asked, “Sabin, why are you so different from everyone else? You have high morals and don’t drink, smoke, or swear, but you seem calm and happy.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,37,"Their positive impression of my father did not match what they had been taught about the Mormons, and my father was able to teach and baptize both shipmates. Dale’s parents were very upset and warned him that if he joined the Church he would lose his sweetheart, Mary Olive, but she met with the missionaries at his request and was also baptized."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,38,"Near the end of the war, President Heber J. Grant called for missionaries, including some married men. In 1946, Dale and his wife, Mary Olive, decided Dale should serve even though they were expecting their first child. They eventually had nine children—three boys and six girls. All nine served missions, followed by Dale and Mary Olive, who served three missions of their own. Dozens of grandchildren have also served. Two of their sons, John and Matthew Maddox, are currently members of the Tabernacle Choir, as is Matthew’s son-in-law Ryan. The Maddox family now numbers 144 and are wonderful examples of being “all in.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,39,"In going through my dad’s papers, we came across a letter from Jennifer Richards, one of the five daughters of the other shipmate, Don Davidson. She wrote: “Your righteousness changed our lives. It is hard to comprehend what our lives would be like without the Church. My dad died loving the gospel and trying to live it to the end.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,40,It is hard to measure the impact for good each individual can have by standing up inside. My father and his two shipmates refused to listen to those in the great and spacious building who were pointing the finger of scorn.They knew that it is far better to follow the Creator than the crowd.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,41,"The Apostle Paul could have been describing our day when he told Timothy that “some having swerved, have turned aside unto vain jangling.”There is a lot of “vain jangling” going on in the world today. It is the conversation of those in the great and spacious building.Often it appears as a form of rationalization to justify wickedness or manifests itself when people lose their way and accelerate. It sometimes comes from those who have not paid the price to be “all in” and prefer to follow the natural man as opposed to the prophet."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,42,"Gratefully, we know how it ends for the faithful. When we are “all in,” we have the all-encompassing assurance that “all things work together for good to them that love God.”As Elder Neal A. Maxwell said, “Don’t fear, just live right.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,43,"My father-in-law taught at BYU and loved BYU football but could not bring himself to watch their games because he was so nervous about the outcome. Then a wonderful thing happened—the VCR was invented, which made it possible for him to record the games. If BYU won, he would watch the recording with perfect confidence, absolutely certain of the ending! If they were penalized unfairly, injured, or behind late in the fourth quarter, he wasn’t stressed because he knew they would pull it out! You might say he had “a perfect brightness of hope”!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,44,"So it is with us. As we are faithful, we can have equal certainty that things will work out well for us in the end. The Lord’s promises are sure. This does not mean this mortal university will be easy or without many tears, but as Paul wrote, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, thethings which God hath prepared for them that love him.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/stand-up-inside-and-be-all-in,Elder Gary B. Sabin,45,"Brothers and sisters, no one has sinned tomorrow. May we recalculate our route if need be and look forward with great hope and faith. May we “stand up inside” by being valiant and “all in.” May we be pure and courageous in defending our Heavenly Father’s plan and the mission of His Son, our Savior. I bear you my witness that our Father lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and of the reality of the great plan of happiness. I pray the Lord’s choicest blessings to be with you, and I do so in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

They reached the conclusion that those who follow the Savior in the present day and strive to be His disciples would probably also have done so back then."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/that-our-light-may-be-a-standard-for-the-nations,Elder Benjamín De Hoyos,5,"Since then, I have reflected on that question and their conclusion. I often wonder how I would have felt hearing the Savior Himself when He said the following in the Sermon on the Mount:"

It is that light that grows and becomes visible when we return home with the feeling of forgiveness that President Henry B. Eyring spoke about in this past October general conference when he said: “Of all the blessings we can count, the greatest by far is the feeling of forgiveness that comes as we partake of the sacrament. We will feel greater love and appreciation for the Savior, whose infinite sacrifice made possible our being cleansed from sin” (“Gratitude on the Sabbath Day,”EnsignorLiahona,Nov. 2016, 100)."

Now that the temples have special schedules for family groups who come with their own family name cards, my wife and I have had delightful experiences as we have served in the temple together with our children and our grandchildren."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/that-our-light-may-be-a-standard-for-the-nations,Elder Benjamín De Hoyos,25,"When we find and take names to the temple and teach others how to as well, together we shine as an ensign or standard."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/that-our-light-may-be-a-standard-for-the-nations,Elder Benjamín De Hoyos,26,"Learning to teach as the Savior taught is another way we can rise and shine. I rejoice along with everyone who is learning how to teach in the Savior’s way. Allow me to read from the cover of the new teaching manual: “The goal of every gospel teacher—every parent, every formally called teacher, every home teacher and visiting teacher, and every follower of Christ—is to teach the pure doctrine of the gospel, by the Spirit, … to help God’s children build their faith in the Savior and become more like Him” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way[2016])."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/that-our-light-may-be-a-standard-for-the-nations,Elder Benjamín De Hoyos,27,"Right now, thousands of our faithful teachers hold up a light as they learn how to teach in the Savior’s way. In this context the new teacher council meeting is a way to rise and shine as the students meet around the standard of the doctrine of Christ, for “the key to teaching as the Savior taught is to live as the Savior lived” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way,4)."

Our Savior commanded us to let our light shine like a city on a hill or like a light from a candlestick. As we do so, we will glorify our Father in Heaven. The Savior’s gospel and His restored Church give us many opportunities for our light to be a part of the great standard for the nations."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,5,"I see the beauty of holiness in sisters whose hearts are centered on all that is good, who want to become more like the Savior. They offer their whole soul, heart, might, mind, and strength to the Lord in the way that they live every day.Holiness is in the striving and the struggle to keep the commandments and to honor the covenants we have made with God. Holiness is making the choices that will keep the Holy Ghost as our guide.Holiness is setting aside our natural tendencies and becoming “a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord.”“Every moment of [our lives] must be holiness to the Lord.”"

Our Father in Heaven has declared, “Behold, I am God; Man of Holiness is my name.”In the premortal world, we loved our Father and worshipped Him. We desired to be like Him. Out of perfect paternal love, He gave His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to be our Savior and Redeemer. He is the Son of Man of Holiness.His “name is Holy,”“the Holy One of Israel.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,9,"Our hope for holiness is centered in Christ, in His mercy and His grace. With faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, we may become clean, without spot, when we deny ourselves of ungodlinessand sincerely repent. We are baptized by water for the remission of sins. Our souls are sanctified when we receive the Holy Ghost with open hearts. Weekly, we partake of the ordinance of the sacrament. In a spirit of repentance, with sincere desires for righteousness, we covenant that we are willing to take upon us the name of Christ, remember Him, and keep His commandments so that we may always have His Spirit to be with us. Over time, as we continually strive to become one with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, we become partakers of Their divine nature."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,11,"I saw holiness in the countenance of Evangeline, a 13-year-old girl in Ghana. One of the ways she keeps her covenants is by magnifying her calling as the Beehive class president. She humbly explained that she goes to the homes of her friends, the less-active young women, to ask their parents to allow them to come to church. The parents tell her that it is difficult because on Sunday the children must do household chores. So Evangeline goes and helps with the chores, and by her efforts her friends are often permitted to come to church."

We retain a remission of sins when we give spiritual and temporal relief to the poor, the hungry, the naked, and the sick.We keep ourselves unspotted from the world when we keep the Sabbath day and worthily receive the sacrament on the Lord’s holy day."

If we are to be a holy people prepared to receive the Savior at His coming, we must arise and put on our beautiful garments.In strength and honor, we forsake the ways of the world and keep our covenants, that we may be “clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,15,Holiness is a gift of the Spirit. We accept this gift when we choose to do those things that will increase the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost in our lives.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,18,"I love the words of the most gentle rebuke that I can imagine. With perfect love and infinite compassion, the Savior admonished:"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,21,"Sisters, if we would be holy, we must learn to sit at the feet of the Holy One of Israel and give time to holiness. Do we set aside the phone, the never-ending to-do list, and the cares of worldliness? Prayer, study, and heeding the word of God invite His cleansing and healing love into our souls. Let us take time to be holy, that we may be filled with His sacred and sanctifying Spirit. With the Holy Ghost as our guide, we will be prepared to receive the Savior in the beauty of holiness."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,22,"According to the inspired words of King Benjamin, those who become saints through the Atonement of Jesus Christ are those who are submissive, meek, humble, patient, and full of love, as the Savior is.He prophesied that Jesus Christ, “the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay.” He came to bless the sick, the lame, the deaf, and the blind and to raise those who had died to life. And yet He suffered “more than man can suffer, except it be unto death.”And though He is the only one through whom salvation comes, He was mocked, scourged, and crucified. But the Son of God rose from the grave, that we may all overcome death. He is the one who will stand to judge the world in righteousness. He is the one who will redeem us all. He is the Holy One of Israel. Jesus Christ is the beauty of holiness."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F. McConkie,23,"When King Benjamin’s people heard his words, they fell to the ground, so great was their humility and reverence for the grace and the glory of our God. They recognized their carnal state. Do we see our utter dependence on the grace and mercy of Christ, our Lord? Do we recognize that every good gift, temporal and spiritual, comes to us through Christ? Do we remember that according to the Father’s eternal plan, peace in this life and the glories of eternity are ours only in and through His holy Son?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-beauty-of-holiness,Carol F.

Oaks,4,"Ourfirst article of faithdeclares, “We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.” We join other Christians in this belief in a Father and a Son and a Holy Ghost, but what we believe about Them is different from the beliefs of others. We do not believe in what the Christian world calls the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. In his First Vision, Joseph Smith saw two distinct personages, two beings, thus clarifying that the then-prevailing beliefs concerning God and the Godhead were not true."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,5,"In contrast to the belief that God is an incomprehensible and unknowable mystery is the truth that the nature of God and our relationship to Him is knowable and is the key to everything else in our doctrine. The Bible records Jesus’s great Intercessory Prayer, where He declared that “this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John 17:3)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,6,"The effort to know God and His work began before mortality and will not be concluded here. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “It will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have learned … all the principles of exaltation.”We build on the knowledge we acquired in the premortal spirit world. Thus, in trying to teach Israelites the nature of God and His relationship to His children, the prophet Isaiah declared, as recorded in the Bible:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,7,“To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? …

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,9,"We know that the three members of the Godhead are separate and distinct beings. We know this from instruction given by the Prophet Joseph Smith: “The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us” (D&C 130:22)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,10,"As to the supreme position of God the Father within the Godhead, as wellas the respective roles each personage performs, the Prophet Joseph explained:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,11,"“Any person that had seen the heavens opened knows that there are three personages in the heavens who hold the keys of power, and one presides over all. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,12,"“… These personages … are called God the first, the Creator; God the second, the Redeemer; and God the third, the Witness or Testator."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,13,"“[It is] the province of the Father to preside as the Chief or President, Jesus as the Mediator, and the Holy Ghost as the Testator or Witness.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,14,We understand our relationship to the members of the Godhead from what is revealed about the plan of salvation.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,15,"Questions like “Where did we come from?” “Why are we here?” and “Where are we going?” are answered in what the scriptures call the “plan of salvation,” the “great plan of happiness,” or the “plan of redemption” (Alma 42:5, 8, 11). The gospel of Jesus Christ is central to this plan."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,16,"As spirit children of God, in an existence prior to mortality, we desired a destiny of eternal life but had progressed as far as we could without a mortal experience in a physical body. To provide that opportunity, our Heavenly Father presided over the Creation of this world, where, deprived of our memory of what preceded our mortal birth, we could prove our willingness to keep His commandments and experience and grow through the other challenges of mortal life. But in the course of that mortal experience, and as a result of the Fall of our first parents, we would suffer spiritual death by being cut off from the presence of God, be soiled by sin, and become subject to physical death. The Father’s plan anticipated and provided ways to overcome all of those barriers."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,17,"Knowing the purpose of God’s great plan, we now consider the respective roles of the three members of the Godhead in that plan."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,18,"We begin with a teaching from the Bible. In concluding his second letter to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul makes this almost offhand reference to the Godhead of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion [or fellowship] of the Holy Ghost, be with you all” (2 Corinthians 13:14)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,19,"This biblical scripture represents the Godhead and references the all-defining and motivating love of God the Father, the merciful and saving mission of Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,20,"It all begins with God the Father. While we know comparatively little about Him, what we know is decisive in understanding His supreme position, our relationship to Him, and His superintending role in the plan of salvation, the Creation, and all else that followed."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,21,"As Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote just before his death: “In the ultimate and final sense of the word, there is only one true and living God. He is the Father, the Almighty Elohim, the Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of the universe.”He is the God and Father of Jesus Christ, as well as of all of us. President David O. McKay taught that “the first fundamental truth advocated by Jesus Christ was this, that behind, above and over all there is God the Father, Lord of heaven and earth.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,22,"What we know of the nature of God the Father is mostly what we canlearn from the ministry and teachings of His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland has taught, one of the paramount purposes of Jesus’s ministry was to reveal to mortals “what God our Eternal Father is like, … to reveal and make personal to us the true nature of His Father, our Father in Heaven.”The Bible contains an apostolic witness that Jesus was “the express image” of His Father’s person (Hebrews 1:3), which merely elaborates Jesus’s own teaching that “he that hath seen me hath seen the Father” (John 14:9)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,23,"God the Father is the Father of our spirits. We are His children. He loves us, and all that He does is for our eternal benefit. He is the author of the plan of salvation, and it is by His power that His plan achieves its purposes for the ultimate glory of His children."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,24,"To mortals, the most visible member of the Godhead is Jesus Christ. A great doctrinal statement by the First Presidency in 1909 declares Him to be “the firstborn among all the sons of God—the first begotten in the spirit, and the only begotten in the flesh.”The Son, the greatest of all, was chosen by the Father to carry out the Father’s plan—to exercise the Father’s power to create worlds without number (seeMoses 1:33) and to save the children of God from death by His Resurrection and from sin by His Atonement. This supernal sacrifice is truly called “the central act of all human history.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,25,"On those unique and sacred occasions when God the Father personally introduced the Son, He has said, “This is my beloved Son: hear him” (Mark 9:7;Luke 9:35; see also3 Nephi 11:7;Joseph Smith—History 1:17). Thus, it is Jesus Christ, Jehovah, the Lord God of Israel, who speaks to and through the prophets.So it is that when Jesus appeared to the Nephites after His Resurrection, He introduced Himself as “the God of the whole earth” (3 Nephi 11:14). So it is that Jesus often speaks to the prophets of the Book of Mormon and to the Latter-day Saints as “the Father and the Son,” a title explained in the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve’s inspired doctrinal exposition just 100 years ago."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,26,"The third member of the Godhead is the Holy Ghost, also referred to as the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Lord, and the Comforter. He is the member of the Godhead who is the agent of personal revelation. As a personage of spirit (seeD&C 130:22), He can dwell in us and perform the essential role of communicator between the Father and the Son and the children of God on earth. Many scriptures teach that His mission is to testify of the Father and the Son (seeJohn 15:26;3 Nephi 28:11;D&C 42:17). The Savior promised that the Comforter will teach us all things, bring all things to our remembrance, and guide us into all truth (seeJohn 14:26;16:13). Thus, the Holy Ghost helps us discern between truth and falsehood, guides us in our major decisions, and helps us through the challenges of mortality.He is also the means by which we are sanctified, that is, cleansed and purified from sin (see2 Nephi 31:17;3 Nephi 27:20;Moroni 6:4)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,27,"So, how does understanding this heavenly revealed doctrine about the Godhead and the plan of salvation help us with our challenges today?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,28,"Because we have the truth about the Godhead and our relationship to Them, the purpose of life, and the nature of our eternal destiny, we have the ultimate road map and assurance for our journey through mortality. We know whom we worship and why we worship. We know who we are and what we can become (seeD&C 93:19). We know who makes it all possible, and we know what we must do to enjoy the ultimate blessings that come through God’s plan of salvation. How do we know all of this? We know by the revelations of God to His prophets and to each of us individually."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,29,"Attaining what the Apostle Paul described as “the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ” (Ephesians 4:13) requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not even enough for us to beconvincedof the gospel; we must act and think so that we areconvertedby it. In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us toknowsomething, the plan of salvation and the gospel of Jesus Christ challenge us tobecomesomething."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,30,"As President Thomas S. Monson taught us in our last general conference:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,31,"“Essential to the plan [of salvation] is our Savior, Jesus Christ. Without His atoning sacrifice, all would be lost. It is not enough, however, merely to believe in Him and His mission. We need to work and learn, search and pray, repent and improve. We need to know God’s laws and live them. We need to receive His saving ordinances. Only by so doing will we obtain true, eternal happiness. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,32,"“From the depths of my soul and in all humility,” President Monson declared, “I testify of the great gift which is our Father’s plan for us. It is the one perfect path to peace and happiness both here and in the world to come.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-godhead-and-the-plan-of-salvation,Elder Dallin H. Oaks,33,"I add my testimony to that of our beloved prophet-president.

And I testify of Jesus Christ, our Savior, who makes it all possible, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

We will always take to heart your words of direction, counsel, and wisdom. We love and sustain you, and we always pray for you. You are indeed the Lord’s prophet. You are our President. We sustain, we love, you."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,5,"Almost two decades ago, the Madrid Spain Temple was dedicated and began its service as a sacred house of the Lord. Harriet and I remember it well because I was serving in the Europe Area Presidency at the time. Along with many others, we spent countless hours attending to the details of planning and organizing the events leading up to the dedication."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,6,"As the date of the dedication approached, I noticed that I had not yet received an invitation to attend. This was a bit unexpected. After all, in my responsibility as the Area President,I had been greatly involved in this temple project and felt a small amount of ownership for it."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,7,I asked Harriet if she had seen an invitation. She had not.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,8,"Days passed and my anxiety increased. I wondered if our invitation had gotten lost—perhaps it was buried between the cushions of our sofa. Maybe it had been mixed up with junk mail and thrown away. The neighbors had an inquisitive cat, and I even began to look suspiciously at him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,9,"Finally I was forced to accept the fact: I had not been invited."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,10,But how was that possible? Had I done something to offend? Did someone just assume it was too far for us to travel? Had I been forgotten?
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,11,"Eventually, I realized that this line of thinking led to a place in which I did not wish to take up residence."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,12,Harriet and I reminded ourselves that the temple dedication was not aboutus.It wasn’t about who deserved to be invited or who did not. And it wasn’t about our feelings or our sense of entitlement.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,13,"It was about dedicating a holy edifice, a temple of the Most High God. It was a day of rejoicing for the members of the Church in Spain."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,14,"Had I been invited to attend, I would have done so gladly. But if I were not invited, my joy would not be any less profound. Harriet and I would rejoice with our friends, our beloved brothers and sisters, from afar. We would praise God for this wonderful blessing just as enthusiastically from our home in Frankfurt as we would from Madrid."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,15,"Among the Twelve whom Jesus called and ordained were two brothers, James and John. Do you remember the nickname He gave them?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,16,Sons of Thunder (Boanerges).
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,17,"You don’t get a nickname like that without an intriguing backstory. Unfortunately, the scriptures don’t provide much explanation about the nickname’s origin. However, we do get brief glimpses into the character of James and John. These were the same brothers who suggested calling down fire from heaven on a village in Samaria over not being invited into town."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,18,"James and John were fishermen—probably a little rough around the edges—but I guess they knew a lot about the elements of nature. Certainly, they were men of action."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,19,"On one occasion, as the Savior prepared to make His final journey to Jerusalem, James and John approached Him with a special request—one perhaps worthy of their nickname."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,20,"“We want you to do for us whatever we ask,” they said."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,21,"I can imagine Jesus smiling at them as He responded, “What do you want?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,22,"“Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,23,"The Savior now challenged them to think a little more deeply about what they were asking and said, “To sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,24,"In other words, you can’t get honor in the kingdom of heaven by campaigning for it. Nor can you “power lunch” your way to eternal glory."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,25,"When the other ten Apostles heard about this request from the Sons of Thunder, they weren’t especially happy. Jesus knew His time was short, and seeing contention among those who would carry on His work must have troubled Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,26,"He talked to the Twelve about the nature of power and how it affects those who seek and hold it. “The people of influence in the world,” He said, “use their position of authority to exercise power over others.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,27,"I can almost see the Savior, looking with infinite love into the faces of those faithful and believing disciples. I can almost hear His pleading voice: “This is not the way it shall be among you. Instead, whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,28,"In God’s kingdom, greatness and leadership means seeing others as they truly are—as God sees them—and then reaching out and ministering to them. It means rejoicing with those who are happy, weeping with those who grieve, lifting up those in distress, and loving our neighbor as Christ loves us. The Savior loves all of God’s childrenregardless of their socioeconomic circumstance, race, religion, language, political orientation, nationality, or any other grouping. And so should we!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,29,God’s greatest reward goes to those who serve without expectation of reward. It goes to those who serve without fanfare; those who quietly go about seeking ways to help others; those who minister to others simply because they love God and God’s children.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,30,"Shortly after my call as a new General Authority, I had the privilege to accompany President James E. Faust for a stake reorganization. As I drove the car to our assignment in beautiful Southern Utah, President Faust was kind enough to use the time to instruct and teach me. One lesson I will never forget. Said he, “The members of the Church are gracious to the General Authorities. They will treat you kindly and say nice things about you.” Then he briefly paused and said, “Dieter,alwaysbe thankful for this, but don’t you ever inhale it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,31,This important lesson about Church service applies to every priesthood holder in every quorum of the Church. It applies to all of us in this Church.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,32,"When President J. Reuben Clark Jr. counseled those called to positions of authority in the Church, he would tell them not to forget rule number six."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,33,"Inevitably, the person would ask, “What is rule number six?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,34,"“Don’t take yourself too darn seriously,” he would say."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,35,"Of course, this led to a follow-up question: “What are the other five rules?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,36,"With a twinkle in his eye, President Clark would say, “There aren’t any.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,37,"To be effective Church leaders, we must learn this critical lesson: leadership in the Church is not so much about directing others as it is about our willingness to be directed by God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,38,"As Saints of the Most High God, we are to “remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple.”Opportunities to go about doing good and to serve others are limitless. We can find them in our communities, in our wards and branches, and certainly in our homes."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,39,"In addition, every member of the Church is given specific formal opportunities to serve. We refer to these opportunities as “callings”—a term that should remind us of who it is that calls us to serve. If we approach our callings as opportunities to serve God and minister to others with faith and humility, every act of service will be a step on the path of discipleship. In this way, God not only builds up His Church but also builds up His servants. The Church is designed to help us become true and faithful disciples of Christ, good and noble sons and daughters of God. This happens not just when we go to meetings and listen to talks but also when we get outside ourselves and serve. This is how we become “great” in the kingdom of God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,40,"We accept callings with grace, humility, and gratitude. When we are released from these callings, we accept the change with the same grace, humility, and gratitude."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,41,"In the eyes of God, there is no calling in the kingdom that is more important than another. Our service—whether great or small—refines our spirits, opens the windows of heaven, and releases God’s blessings not only upon those we serve but upon us as well. When we reach out to others, we can know with humble confidence that God acknowledges our service with approval and approbation. He smiles upon us as we offer these heartfelt acts of compassion, especially acts that are unseen and unnoticed by others."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,42,"Each time we give of ourselves to others, we take a step closer to becoming good and true disciples of the One who gave His all for us: our Savior."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,43,"During the 150th anniversary of the pioneers’ arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, Brother Myron Richins was serving as a stake president in Henefer, Utah. The celebration included a reenactment of the pioneers’ passage through his town."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,44,"President Richins was heavily involved with the plans for the celebration, and he attended many meetings with General Authorities and others to discuss the events. He was fully engaged."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,45,"Just before the actual celebration, President Richins’s stake was reorganized, and he was released as president. On a subsequent Sunday, he was attending his ward priesthood meeting when the leaders asked for volunteers to help with the celebration. PresidentRichins, along with others, raised his hand and was given instructions to dress in work clothes and to bring his truck and a shovel."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,46,"Finally, the morning of the big event came, and President Richins reported to volunteer duty."

Uchtdorf,47,"Only a few weeks before, he had been an influential contributor to the planning and supervision of this major event.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,48,President Richins did so gladly and joyfully.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,49,He understood that one kind of service is not above another.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,50,"He knew and put into practice the words of the Savior: “He that is greatest among you shall be your servant.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,51,"Sometimes, like the Sons of Thunder, we desire positions of prominence. We strive for recognition. We seek to lead and to make a memorable contribution."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,52,"There is nothing wrong with wanting to serve the Lord, but when we seek to gain influence in the Church for our own sake—in order to receive the praise and admiration of men—we have our reward. When we “inhale” the praise of others, that praise will be our compensation."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,53,"What is the most important calling in the Church? It is the one you currently have. No matter how humble or prominent it may seem to be, the calling you have right now is the one that will allow you not only to lift others but also to become the man of God you were created to be."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,54,"My dear friends and brethren in the priesthood, lift where you stand!"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,57,"Let us follow the example of our Savior, who was meek and lowly, who sought not the praise of men but to do the will of His Father."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F. Uchtdorf,58,"Let us serve others humbly—with energy, gratitude, and honor.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-greatest-among-you,President Dieter F.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,4,"After being called as a General Authority, I moved with my family from Costa Rica to Salt Lake City for my first assignment. Here in the United States, I have been blessed to visit wonderful people of different ethnic backgrounds and cultures. Among them are many who, like me, were born in the countries of Latin America."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,5,"I have noticed that many of the first-generation Hispanics here speak Spanish as their primary language and enough English to communicate with others. The second generation, who were either born in the United States or came at an early age and attend school here, speak very good English and perhaps some broken Spanish. And often by the third generation, Spanish, the native language of their ancestors, is lost."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,6,"In linguistic terms, this is simply called “language loss.” Language loss may happen when families move to a foreign land where their native language is not predominant. It happens not only among Hispanics but also among populations throughout the world where a native language is replaced in favor of a new one.Even Nephi, a prophet in the Book of Mormon, was concerned about losing the native language of his fathers when he was preparing to move to the promised land. Nephi writes, “Behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, thatwe may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,7,"But Nephi was also concerned about losing another kind of language. In the next verse, he continues, “Andalso thatwe may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets,which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,8,I noticed a similarity between preserving a mother tongue and preserving the gospel of Jesus Christ in our lives.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,9,"Today in my analogy, I would like to emphasize not any particular earthly language but rather an eternal language that must be preserved in our families and never lost. I speak of the languageof the gospel of Jesus Christ. By “language of the gospel,” I mean all the teachings of our prophets, our obedience to those teachings, and our following righteous traditions."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,10,I will discuss three ways that this language can be preserved.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,11,"In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord invited many prominent members of the Church, including Newel K. Whitney, to set their homes in order. The Lord said, “My servant Newel K. Whitney … hath need to be chastened, and set in order his family, and see thatthey are more diligent and concerned at home,and pray always, or they shall be removed out of their place.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,12,"One factor that influences language loss is when parents don’t spend time teaching their children the native language. It is not enough to merelyspeakthe language in the home. If parents desire to preserve their language, it must betaught.Research has found that parents who make a conscious effort to preserve their native language tend to succeed in doing so.So what would be a conscious effort to preserve the language of the gospel?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,13,Elder David A. Bednar of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles cautioned that “weak gospel teaching and modeling in the home” is a powerful cause that may break the cycle of multigenerational families in the Church.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,14,"We can therefore conclude that powerful teaching is extremely important to preserve the gospel in our families, and it requires diligence and effort."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,15,We have been invited many times to acquire the practice of daily family and personal scripture study.Many families that are doing this are blessed each day with greater unity and a closer relationship with the Lord.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,16,"When will daily scripture study happen? It will happen when parents take the scriptures in hand and, with love, invite the family to gather together to study. It is difficult to see this study happening in any other way."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,17,"Fathers and mothers, don’t miss out on these great blessings. Don’t wait until it’s too late!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,18,"One linguistics expert wrote that to preserve a native language, “you need tobring the language alivefor your children.”We “bring language alive” when our teaching and modeling work together."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,19,"When I was young, I worked in my father’s factory during vacations. The first question my father always asked after I received my salary was “What are you going to do with your money?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,20,"I knew the answer and responded, “Pay my tithing and save for my mission.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,21,"After working with him for about eight years and constantly answering his same question, my father figured he had taught me about paying my tithing. What he didn’t realize was that I had learned this important principle in just one weekend. Let me tell you how I learned that principle."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,22,"After some events related to a civil war in Central America, my father’s business went bankrupt. He went from about 200 full-time employees to fewer than five sewing operators who worked as needed in the garage of our home. One day during those difficult times, I heard my parents discussing whether they should pay tithing or buy food for the children."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,23,"On Sunday, I followed my father to see what he was going to do. After our Church meetings, I saw him take an envelope and put his tithing in it. That was only part of the lesson. The question that remained for me was what we were going to eat."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,24,"Early Monday morning, some people knocked on our door. When I opened it, they asked for my father. I called for him, and when he arrived, the visitors told him about an urgent sewing order they needed as quickly as possible. They told him that the order was so urgent that they would pay for it in advance. That day I learned the principles of paying tithing and the blessings that follow."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,25,"In the New Testament, the Lord talks about modeling. He says, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Fatherdo: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,26,"It is not enough just totalkto our children about the importance of temple marriage, fasting, and keeping the Sabbath day holy. They must see us making room in our schedules to attend the temple as frequently as we can. They need to see our commitment to fasting regularlyand keeping the entire Sabbath day holy. If our youth cannot fast two meals, cannot study the scriptures regularly, and cannot turn off the TV during a big game on Sunday, will they have the spiritual self-discipline to resist the powerful temptations of today’s challenging world, including the temptation of pornography?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,27,Another way language can be altered or lost is when other languages and traditions are mixed with a mother tongue.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,28,"In the early years of the restored Church, the Lord invited many prominent members of the Church to set their homes in order. He began His invitation by addressing two ways we may lose light and truth from our homes: “That wicked one cometh andtaketh away light and truth,throughdisobedience,from the children of men, andbecause of the tradition of their fathers.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,29,"As families, we need to avoid any tradition that will prevent us from keeping the Sabbath day holy or having daily scripture study and prayer at home. We need to close the digital doors of our home to pornography and all other evil influences. To combat the worldly traditions of our day, we need to use the scriptures and the voice of our modern prophets to teach our children about their divine identity, their purpose in life, and the divine mission of Jesus Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,30,"In the scriptures, we find several examples of “language loss.”For example:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,31,"“Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation thatcould not understand the wordsof king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,32,“And now because of their unbeliefthey could not understand the word of God;and their hearts were hardened.”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,33,"For the rising generation, the gospel became a strange language. And while the benefits of maintaining a native language are sometimes debated, in the context of the plan of salvation there isno debateabout the eternal consequences of losing the language of the gospel in our homes."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,34,"As children of God, we are imperfect people trying to learn a perfect language.Just as a mother is compassionate with her little children, our Heavenly Father is patient with our imperfections and mistakes. He treasures and understands our feeblest utterances, mumbled in sincerity, as if they were fine poetry. He rejoices at the sound of our first gospel words. He teaches us with perfect love."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-language-of-the-gospel,Elder Valeri V. Cordón,35,"No achievement in this life, important as it may be, will be relevant if we lose the language of the gospel in our families.It is my testimony that Heavenly Father will bless us in our efforts as we strive to embrace His language, even until we become fluent in this higher level of communication, which always was our mother tongue. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,4,"Some years ago I was called, with my wife, Jacqui, to preside over the Washington Spokane Mission. We arrived in the mission field with a mix of fear and excitement at the responsibility of working with so many remarkable young missionaries. They came from many different backgrounds and quickly became like our own sons and daughters."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,5,"Although most were doing wonderfully well, a few were struggling with the high expectations of their calling. I remember one missionary telling me, “President, I just don’t like people.” Several told me they lacked the desire to follow the rather strict missionary rules. I worried and wondered what we could do to change the hearts of those few missionaries who had not yet learned the joy of being obedient."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,6,"One day while driving through the beautiful rolling wheat fields on the Washington-Idaho border, I was listening to a recording of the New Testament. As I listened to the familiar account of the rich young man coming to the Savior to ask what he might do to have eternal life, I received an unexpected but profound personal revelation that is now a sacred memory."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,7,"After hearing Jesus recite the commandments and the young man reply that he had observed all these sincehis youth, I listened for the Savior’s gentle correction: “One thing thou lackest: … sell whatsoever thou hast, and … come, … follow me.”But to my astonishment, I instead heard six words before that part of the verse that I seemed never to have heard or read before. It was as if they had been added to the scriptures. I marveled at the inspired understanding which then unfolded."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,8,"What were these six words that had such a profound effect? Listen to see if you can recognize these seemingly ordinary words, not found in the other Gospel accounts but found only in the Gospel of Mark:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,9,"“There came one running … and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,10,"“And Jesus said unto him, …"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,12,"“And he answered … , Master, all these have I observed from my youth."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,13,"“Then Jesus beholding him loved him,and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,14,“Then Jesus beholding him loved him.”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,15,"As I heard these words, a vivid image filled my mind of our Lord pausing andbeholdingthis young man.Beholding—as in looking deeply and penetratingly into his soul, recognizing his goodness and also his potential, as well as discerning his greatest need."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,16,"Then the simple words—Jesusloved him.He felt an overwhelming love and compassion for this good young man, andbecauseof this love andwiththis love, Jesus asked even more of him. I pictured what it must have felt like for this young man to be enveloped by such love even while being asked to do something so supremely hard as selling all he owned and giving it to the poor."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,17,"In that moment, I knew it was not just the hearts of some of our missionaries that needed changing. It was my heart as well. The question no longer was “How does a frustrated mission president get a struggling missionary to behave better?” Instead, the question was “How can I be filled with Christlike love so a missionary can feel the love of God through me and desire to change?” How can Ibeholdhim or her in the same way the Lord beheld the rich young man, seeing them for who they really are and who they can become, rather than just for what they are doing or not doing? How can I be more like the Savior?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,18,“Then Jesus beholding him loved him.”
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,19,"From that time forward, as I sat knee to knee with a young missionary struggling with some aspect of obedience, within my heart I now saw a faithful young man or young woman who had acted on the desire to come on a mission. Then I was able to say with all the feeling like that of a tender parent:“Elder or Sister, if I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t care what happens on your mission. But I do love you, and because I love you, I care about who you become. So I invite you to change those things that are hard for you and become who the Lord wants you to be.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,20,"Each time I went to interview missionaries, I first prayed for the gift of charity and that I could see each elder and sister as the Lord sees him or her."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,21,"Before zone conferences, as Sister Palmer and I greeted each missionary one by one, I would pause and look deeply into their eyes,beholdingthem—an interview without words—and then without fail, I was filled withgreatlovefor these precious sons and daughters of God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,22,"I have learned many life-changing lessons from this deeply personal experience withMark chapter 10. Here are four of these lessons I believe will help each of us:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,23,"As we learn to see others as the Lord sees them rather than with our own eyes, our love for them will grow and so will our desire to help them.We will see potential within others they likely do not see in themselves. With Christlike love we will not be afraid to speak with boldness, for “perfect love casteth out fear.”And we will never give up, remembering that those who are hardest to love need love the most."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,24,"No true teaching or learning will ever occur when done in frustration or anger, and hearts will not change where love is not present.Whether we act in our roles as parents, teachers, or leaders, true teaching will happen only in an atmosphere of trust rather than condemnation. Our homes should always be safe havens for our children—not hostile environments."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,25,"Love should never be withdrawn when a child, friend, or family member fails to live up to our expectations.We don’t know what happened to the rich young man after he went away sorrowful, but I am confident Jesus still loved him perfectly even if he chose the easier path. Perhaps later in life, as he found his great possessions hollow, he remembered and acted on the singular experience of His Lord beholding him, loving him, and inviting him to follow Him."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,26,"Because He loves us, the Lord expects much of us.If we are humble, we will welcome the Lord’s invitations to repent, to sacrifice, and to serve as evidence of His perfect love for us. After all, an invitation to repent is also an invitation to receive the wonderful gift of forgiveness and peace. Therefore, “despise not … the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him: for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/then-jesus-beholding-him-loved-him,Elder S. Mark Palmer,27,"My dear brothers and sisters, now anytime you feel you are being asked to do something hard—give up a poor habit or an addiction, put aside worldly pursuits, sacrifice a favorite activity because it is the Sabbath, forgive someone who has wronged you—think of the Lordbeholdingyou,lovingyou, and inviting you to let it go andfollow Him.And thank Him for loving you enough to invite you to do more."

Before I begin my formal message today, I would like to announce five new temples which will be built in the following locations: Brasília, Brazil; greater Manila, Philippines, area; Nairobi, Kenya; Pocatello, Idaho, USA; and Saratoga Springs, Utah, USA."

If you are not reading the Book of Mormon each day, please do so. If you will read it prayerfully and with a sincere desire to know the truth, the Holy Ghost will manifest its truth to you. If it is true—and I solemnly testify that itis—then Joseph Smith was a prophet who saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,4,"The prophet Ezekiel was born about two decades before Lehi and his family left Jerusalem. In 597 BC, at age 25, Ezekiel was one of the many carried captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, and as best we can tell, he spent the rest of his life there.He was of the Aaronic priestly lineage, and when he was 30, he became a prophet."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,5,"In commissioning Ezekiel, Jehovah used the metaphor of a watchman."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,6,"“If when [the watchman] seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,7,"“Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,8,"On the other hand, “if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, … his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,9,"Then speaking directly to Ezekiel, Jehovah declared, “So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them [for] me.”The warning was to turn away from sin."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,10,"“When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,11,"“Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,12,"“Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,13,"“None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,14,"Interestingly, this warning also applies to the righteous. “When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his [righteous deeds] shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,15,"Pleading with His children, God tells Ezekiel, “Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,16,"Far from being anxious to condemn, our Heavenly Father and our Savior seek our happiness and plead with us to repent, knowing full well that “wickedness never was [and never will be] happiness.”So Ezekiel and every prophet before and since, speaking the word of God out of a full heart, have warned all who will to turn away from Satan, the enemy of their souls, and “choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,17,"While the duty to warn is felt especially keenly by prophets, it is a duty shared by others as well. In fact, “it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor.”We who have received a knowledge of the great plan of happiness—and its implementing commandments—should feel a desire to share that knowledge since it makes all the difference here and in eternity. And if we ask, “Who is myneighbor that I should warn?” surely the answer will be found in a parable that begins, “A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves,”and so forth."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,18,"Considering the parable of the good Samaritan in this context reminds us that the question “Who is my neighbor?” was tied to the two great commandments: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.”The motivation for raising the warning voice is love—love of God and love of fellowman. To warn is to care. The Lord instructs that it is to be done “in mildness and in meekness”and “by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness … , and by love unfeigned.”It can be urgent, as when we warn a child not to put his or her hand in a fire. It must be clear and sometimes firm. On occasion, warning may take the form of reproof “when moved upon by the Holy Ghost,”but always it is rooted in love. Witness, for example, the love that motivates the service and sacrifices of our missionaries."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,19,"Surely love would compel parents to warn their closest “neighbors”—their own children. This means teaching and testifying of gospel truths. It means teaching children the doctrine of Christ: faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.The Lord reminds parents, “I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,20,"A crucial element of the parental duty to warn is to paint not only the demoralizing consequences of sin but also the joy of walking in obedience to the commandments. Recall the words of Enos about what led him to seek God, receive a remission of sins, and become converted:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,21,"“Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life,and the joy of the saints,sunk deep into my heart."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,22,"“And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,23,"Because of His incomparable love and concern for others and their happiness, Jesus was not hesitant to warn. At the outset of His ministry, “Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”Because He knows that not just any path leads to heaven, He commanded:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,24,"“Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,25,"“Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,26,"He devoted time to sinners, saying, “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,27,"As for the scribes and Pharisees and Sadducees, Jesus was uncompromising in condemning their hypocrisy. His warnings and commandments were direct: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.”Surely no one would accuse the Savior of not loving these scribes and Pharisees—after all, He suffered and died to save them too. But loving them, He could not let them go on in sin without clearly correcting them. One observer noted, “Jesus taught his followers to do as he did: to welcome everyone but also to teach about sin, since love demands warning people about what can hurt them.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,28,"Sometimes those who raise a warning voice are dismissed as judgmental. Paradoxically, however, those who claim truth is relative and moral standards are a matter of personal preference are often the same ones who most harshly criticize people who don’t accept the current norm of “correct thinking.” One writer referred to this as the “shame culture”:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,29,"“In a guilt culture you know you are good or bad by what your conscience feels. In a shame culture you know you are good or bad by what your community says about you, by whether it honors or excludes you. … [In the shame culture,] moral life is not built on the continuum of right and wrong; it’s built on the continuum of inclusion and exclusion. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,30,"“… Everybody is perpetually insecure in a moral system based on inclusion and exclusion. There are no permanent standards, just the shifting judgment of the crowd. It is a culture of oversensitivity, overreaction and frequent moral panics, during which everybody feels compelled to go along. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,31,"“The guilt culture could be harsh, but at least you could hate the sin and still love the sinner. The modern shame culture allegedly values inclusion and tolerance, but it can be strangely unmerciful to those who disagree and to those who don’t fit in.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,32,"Contrasted to this is “the rock of our Redeemer,”a stable and permanent foundation of justice and virtue. How much better it is to have the unchanging law of God by which we may act to choose our destiny rather than being hostage to the unpredictable rules and wrath of the social media mob. How much better it is to know the truth than to be “tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.”How much better to repent and rise to the gospel standard than to pretend there is no right or wrong and languish in sin and regret."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,33,"The Lord has declared, “The voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.”As watchmen and disciples, we cannot be neutral about this “more excellent way.”As Ezekiel, we cannot see the sword coming upon the land “and blow not the trumpet.”This is not to say that we should bang on our neighbor’s door or stand in the public square shouting, “Repent!” Truly, when you think about it, we have in the restored gospel what people, deep down, really want. So the warning voice is generally not only civil, but in the Psalmist’s phrase, it is a “joyful noise.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,34,"Deseret Newsopinion editor Hal Boyd cited one example of the disservice inherent in staying silent. He noted that while the idea of marriage is still a matter of “intellectual debate” among elites in American society, marriage itself is not a matter of debate for them in practice. “‘Elites get and stay married and make sure their kids enjoy the benefits of stable marriage.’ … The problem, however, is that [they] tend not to preach what they practice.” They don’t want to “impose” on those who really could use their moral leadership,but “it is perhaps time for those with education and strong families to stop feigning neutrality and start preaching what they practice pertaining to marriage and parenting … [and] help their fellow Americans embrace it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,35,"We trust that especially you of the rising generation, youth and young adults on whom the Lord must rely for the success of His work in future years, will sustain the teachings of the gospel and the standards of the Church in public as well as in private. Do not abandon those who would welcome truth to floundering and failing in ignorance. Do not succumb to false notions of tolerance or to fear—fear of inconvenience, disapproval, or even suffering. Remember the Savior’s promise:"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning,Elder D. Todd Christofferson,38,"Ultimately, we are all accountable to God for our choices and the lives we live. The Savior declared, “My Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.”"

Costa,4,"On a Friday afternoon, September 16, 1988, in the Vicente López Ward meetinghouse in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A very good friend, Alin Spannaus, baptized me that day, and I felt happy, lighter, eager to learn more."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,5,"Today, I would like to share some lessons I learned on my path to baptism—lessons that I hope may help those of you listening who are not members of the Church yet. I pray that your hearts may be touched by the Spirit, as was mine."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,6,"Why would a person without compelling challenges, needs, or questions be interested in meeting the missionaries and listening to their lessons? Well, in my case it was love—love for a girl, a girl named Renee. I fell in love with her, and I wanted to marry her. She was different and had standards different from most young women I knew. But I fell for her and asked her to marry me—and she said no!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,7,"I was confused. I thought I was quite a catch! I was handsome, 24 years old, and a college graduate with a great job. She spoke of her goals—of marrying only someone who could take her to the temple, of having an eternal family—and she declined my offer. I wanted to continue the relationship, so I agreed to listen to the missionaries. Is this a good reason to meet with the missionaries? Well, it was for me."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,8,"When I first met with the missionaries, I did not understand much of what they said, and to tell you the truth, I may not have paid much attention to them. My heart was closed to a new religion. I wanted only to prove they were wrong and to gain time to convince Renee to marry me anyway."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,9,"Today my children have served and are serving missions, and I understand the sacrifices that these young men and young women make to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ. Now I wish I had paid more attention to Elder Richardson, Elder Farrell, and Elder Hyland, the wonderful missionaries who taught me."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,10,"So, from my first lesson, I say to you friends and investigators of the Church:once you meet the missionaries, please take them seriously; they are giving up important years of their lives just for you."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,11,"The first time I attended a Church meeting, I heard many words that didn’t make sense to me. Who were the Beehives? What was the Aaronic Priesthood? the Relief Society?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,12,"If this is the first time you have attended a Church meeting and you are feeling confused by something you don’t understand, do not worry! I was clueless too. But I still remember the impressions, the new feelings of peace and joy I experienced. I did not know it then, but the Holy Ghost was whispering to my ears and to my heart, “This is right.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,13,"So let me put this lesson in one sentence:if you are confused, don’t worry—remember the feelings you have experienced; they come from God."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,14,"After several meetings with the missionaries, I was not making much progress. I felt I had not received a confirmation of the truthfulness of the gospel."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,15,"One day, Renee asked me, “Are you reading the Book of Mormon?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,16,"I replied, “No.” I was listening to the missionaries—wasn’t that enough?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,17,"With tears in her eyes, Renee assured me that she knew the Book of Mormon is true and explained that if I wanted to know if it is true, the only way is—guess what—to read it! And then ask!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,18,"Read, ponder in your hearts, and “ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, … with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ” (Moroni 10:4) if the Book of Mormon is true, if this is the true Church."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,19,"So the third lesson, in one sentence:when you receive these things—the Book of Mormon—and you are exhorted to read and ask God if they are true, please just do it!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,20,"The final experience I’d like to share is about repentance. After I had finished taking all the missionary lessons, I was still not convinced I needed to change anything in my life. It was Elder Cutler, a young, confident missionary with limited Spanish, who one day said, “Joaquin, let’s read togetherAlma 42, and we will include your name as we read it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,21,"I thought it was silly, but I did as Elder Cutler asked and read inverse 1: “And now, my son [Joaquin], I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand.” Oh! The book was speaking to me."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,22,"And we read inverse 2: “Now behold, my son [Joaquin], I will explain this thing unto thee,” and then the Fall of Adam was described."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,23,"And then inverse 4: “And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto [Joaquin] to repent.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,24,"We continued reading slowly, verse by verse, until we reached the last three verses. Then I was struck by a powerful force. The book spokedirectlyto me, and I started to cry as I read, “And now, [Joaquin,] my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you … unto repentance” (verse 29)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,25,"I realize now that I had expected to receive revelation without paying the price. Until then I had never truly spoken to God, and the idea of speaking to someone who wasn’t present seemed foolish. I had to humble myself and do what I was being asked to do even if, in my worldly mind, it sounded silly."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,26,"That day I opened my heart to the Spirit, desired to repent, and wanted to be baptized! Before that moment, I had thought of repentance as something negative, associated only with sin and wrongdoing, but suddenly I saw it in a different light—as something positive that cleared the path to growth and happiness."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,27,"Elder Cutler is here today, and I want to thank him for opening my eyes. Every decision I have made in my life since then has been influenced by that moment when I humbled myself and prayed for forgiveness, and the Atonement of Jesus Christ on my behalf became part of my life."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,28,"So the last lesson, in one statement:experience repentance; nothing draws you closer to the Lord Jesus Christ than a desire to change."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,29,"My dear investigator, friend of the Church, if you are listening today, you are very close to reaching the greatest joy. You are close!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,30,"Let me invite you, with all the energy of my heart and from the depths of my soul: go and be baptized! It is the best thing you will ever do. It will change not only your life but also the lives of your children and grandchildren."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,31,"The Lord has blessed me with a family. I married Renee, and we have four beautiful children. And because of my baptism, I can, like the prophet Lehi of old, invite them to partake of the fruit of the tree of life, which is the love of God (see1 Nephi 8:15;11:25). I can help them come unto Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,32,"So please consider my experiences, and (1) take the missionaries very seriously, (2) go to church and remember spiritual feelings, (3) read the Book of Mormon and ask the Lord if it is true, and (4) experience repentance and be baptized."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/to-the-friends-and-investigators-of-the-church,Elder Joaquin E. Costa,33,"I testify to you that if you pay the price of revelation, humble yourself, read, pray, and repent, the heavens will open and you will know, as I know, that Jesus is the Christ, He is my Savior, and He is yours. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,4,"While I was traveling in Asia, a dear sister approached me. She wrapped her arms around me and asked, “Do you really believe that this gospel is true?” Dear sister, I know it is true. I trust in the Lord."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,5,"InProverbs 3:5–6, we read this counsel:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,6,“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,7,"“In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,8,"This scripture comes with two admonitions, a warning, and a glorious promise. The two admonitions: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart” and “in all thy ways acknowledge him.” The warning: “Lean not unto thine own understanding.” And the glorious promise: “He shall direct thy paths.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,9,"Let’s first discuss the warning. The visual image gives us much to ponder. The warning comes in the words “lean not”—“lean not unto thine own understanding.” In English the wordleanhas a connotation of physically listing or moving to one side. When wephysicallylean toward one side or another, we move off center, we are out of balance, and we tip. When wespirituallylean to our own understanding, we lean away from our Savior. If we lean, we are not centered; we are not balanced; we are not focused on Christ."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,10,"Sisters, remember, in our premortal life we stood with the Savior. We trusted Him. We voiced our support, enthusiasm, and joy for the plan of happiness set forth by our Heavenly Father. We leaned not. We fought with our testimonies and “aligned ourselves with the forces of God, and those forces were victorious.”This battle between good and evil has moved to earth. Once again we have the sacred responsibility to stand as a witness and put our trust in the Lord."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,11,"We must each ask: How do I keep centered andlean notunto my own understanding? How do I recognize and follow the Savior’s voice when the voices of the world are so compelling? How do I cultivate trust in the Savior?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,12,"May I suggest three ways to increase our knowledge of and trust in the Savior. You will find that these principles are not new, but they are foundational. They are sung in every Primary, echoed in Young Women lessons, and are responses to many Relief Society questions. They are centering—and not leaning—principles."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,13,"First, we can come to know the Lord and trust Him as we “feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,14,"Several months ago we were having family scripture study. My two-year-old grandson was sitting on my lap as we read. I was in full-blown grandma mode, relishing the visit of my son’s family."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,15,"With our scripture study complete, I closed my book. My grandson knew that it would soon be bedtime. He looked up with his eager blue eyes and spoke an eternal truth: “More scriptures, Nana.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,16,"My son, a good and consistent parent, warned me, “Mom, don’t be a weak link. He is just trying to get out of going to bed.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,17,"But when my grandson asks for more scriptures, we read more scriptures! More scriptures enlighten our minds, nourish our spirits, answer our questions, increase our trust in the Lord, and help us center our lives on Him. “Remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,18,"Second, we can come to know the Lord and trust Him through prayer. What a blessing to be able to pray to our God! “Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,19,"I have a sweet memory of a prayer that I treasure. For one of my summer breaks from college, I accepted a job in Texas. I had to drive hundreds of miles from Idaho to Texas in my old car, a car I had affectionately named Vern. Vern was packed to the roof, and I was ready for the new adventure."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,20,"On my way out the door, I gave my dear mother a hug and she said, “Let’s say a prayer before you leave.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,21,"We knelt and my mother began to pray. She pleaded with Heavenly Father for my safety. She prayed for my non-air-conditioned car, asking that the car would function as I needed. She asked for angels to be with me throughout the summer. She prayed and prayed and prayed."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,22,The peace that came from that prayer gave me the courage to trust in the Lord and lean not to my own understanding. The Lord directed my path in the many decisions I made that summer.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,23,"As we make a habit of approaching Heavenly Father in prayer, we will come to know the Savior. We will come to trust Him. Our desires will become more like His. We will be able to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that Heavenly Father is ready to give if we will but ask in faith."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,24,"Third, we can come to know the Lord and trust Him as we serve others. I share the following story with permission from Amy Wright, who came to understand the principle of serving even amid a terrifying and life-threatening illness. Amy wrote:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,25,"“On October 29, 2015, I found out I had cancer. My cancer has a 17 percent survival rate. The odds weren’t good. I knew that I would be in for the fight of my life. I was determined to give it everything I had not just for myself but, more important, for my family. In December, I began chemo. I wasfamiliar with many of the side effects of cancer-fighting drugs, but I did not know that it was possible for someone to be so sick and still be alive."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,26,"“At one point, I declared chemotherapy a human rights violation. I told my husband that I was done. I quit! I was not going back to the hospital. In his wisdom, my sweetheart patiently listened and then responded, ‘Well, then we need to find someone to serve.’”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,27,What? Did he miss the fact that his wife had cancer and couldn’t take one more bout of nausea or one more moment of excruciating pain?
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,28,"Amy goes on to explain: “My symptoms gradually worsened to where I generally had one or two ‘OK’ days a month [when] I could somewhat function as a living, breathing human being. It was those days when our family would find ways to serve.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,29,"On one of those days, Amy’s family distributed chemo comfort kits to other patients, kits filled with items to cheer and to help relieve symptoms. When Amy couldn’t sleep, she would think of ways to brighten someone else’s day. Some ways were big, but many were just small notes or text messages of encouragement and love. On those nights when her pain was too great to sleep, she would lie in bed with her iPad and search for ordinances that needed to be completed on behalf of her deceased ancestors. Miraculously the pain would subside, and she was able to endure."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,30,"“Service,” Amy testifies, “saved my life. Where I ultimately found my strength to keep moving forward was the happiness I discovered in trying to relieve the suffering of those around me. I looked forward to our service projects with great joy and anticipation. Still to this day it seems like such a strange paradox. You would think that someone who was bald, poisoned, and fighting for [her] life was justified in thinking that ‘right now it is all about me.’ However, when I thought about myself, my situation, my suffering and pain, the world became very dark and depressing. When my focus turned to others, there was light, hope, strength, courage, and joy. I know that this is possible because of the sustaining, healing, and enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,31,"Amy came to trust in the Lord as she came to know Him. If she had leaned even a little to her own understanding, she might have rejected the idea that she serve. Service enabled her to withstand her pain and afflictions and to live this scripture: “When ye are in theservice of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,32,"Jesus Christ has overcome the world. And because of Him, because of His infinite Atonement, we all have great cause to trust, knowing that ultimately all will be well."

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,34,"We are on earth to demonstrate the same trust inHimthat allowed us to stand with Jesus Christ when He declared, “Here am I, send me.”"

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/trust-in-the-lord-and-lean-not,Bonnie H. Cordon,36,"I add my testimony to that of our beloved prophet.

  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,4,"My beloved brethren of the priesthood, my purpose today is both to reassure you and to invigorate you in your priesthood service. In some ways, it is similar to the purpose I imagine the Savior had when He met a rich young man who asked, “What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” (Matthew 19:16). Perhaps you have come to this conference, as this young man went to the Savior, wondering whether your service has been acceptable. And at the same time, you may sense that there is more to do—perhaps much more! I pray that I may be able to convey the Lord’s loving approval for what you have already done, while also offering an encouraging glimpse of what you may, with His help, yet achieve as a holder of His holy priesthood."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,5,"The rich young man was asked to sell everything he had and give to the poor and follow the Savior; your future progress may not require that, but it will require a measure of sacrifice. Either way, I hope my message does not cause you to “[go] away sorrowful,” as the young man did. (SeeMatthew 19:20–22.) Rather, I trust that you will “go on your way rejoicing” (D&C 84:105) because you want to improve and you think you can."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,6,"Even so, it’s natural to feel some inadequacy when we consider what the Lord has called us to do. In fact, if you told me that you feel perfectly capable of fulfilling your priesthood duties, I might worry that you do not understand them. On the other hand, if you told me that you feel like giving up because the task is too far beyond your abilities, then I would want to help you understand how the Lord magnifies and strengthens the holders of His priesthood to do things they never could have done alone."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,7,"This is just as true for me in my calling as it is for you in yours. None of us can do the work of the priesthood, and do it well, relying solely on our own wisdom and talents. That is because this is not our work—it is the Lord’s. So the only way to succeed is to rely on Him, whether you are a newly called deacon trusted with the task to bring a measure of spiritual power to the ordinance of the sacrament; or a young home teacher assigned by the Lord to love and minister to a family you don’t know and who seems not to want your love or your ministering; or a father who knows you are to preside over your home in righteousness, but perhaps you’re unsure how to do it, and time seems to be running out, because those children are growing up quickly and the world seems so harsh and hostile."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,8,"So if you feel a little overwhelmed, take that as a good sign. It indicates that you can sense the magnitude of the trust God has placed in you. It means that you have some small understanding of what the priesthood really is."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,9,"There are very few people in the world who have that understanding. Even those who can recite a reasonable definition may not truly understand it. There are some scriptures that, through the power of the Spirit they carry, can deepen our sense of awe regarding the holy priesthood. Here are some of those scriptures:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,10,"“The power and authority of the … Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church—"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,11,"“To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,12,"“The power and authority of the … Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold the keys of the ministering of angels” (D&C 107:18–20)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,13,"“In the ordinances [of the priesthood], the power of godliness is manifest. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,14,"“For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live” (D&C 84:20, 22)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,15,"“This high priesthood [is] after the order of [God’s] Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of all things” (Alma 13:7)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,16,"“Every one being ordained after this order and calling should have power, by faith, to break mountains, to divide the seas, to dry up waters, to turn them out of their course;"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,17,"“To put at defiance the armies of nations, to divide the earth, to break every band, to stand in the presence of God; to do all things according to his will, according to his command, subdue principalities and powers; and this by the will of the Son of God which was from before the foundation of the world” (Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:30–31 [in the Bible appendix])."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,18,"One way to respond to such awe-inspiring descriptions of the power of the priesthood is to assume that they do not apply to us. Another way to respond is with soul-searching questions, asked in our own hearts, such as these: Have I ever felt that the heavens have been opened to me? Would anyone use the phrase “ministering of angels” to describe my priesthood service? Do I bring the “power of godliness” into the lives of those I serve? Have I ever broken a mountain, defied an army, broken someone’s bands, or subdued worldly powers—even if only figuratively—in order to accomplish God’s will?"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,19,Such introspection always brings a feeling that we could be doing more in the service of the Lord. I hope it also brings you a feeling that youwantto do more—a longing to participate more fully in the Lord’s miraculous work. Such feelings are the first step toward becoming the kind of men that priesthood service is meant to produce.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,20,"The next step is described in an interaction between Jehovah and Enoch. We know Enoch as a mighty prophet who established Zion in the midst of great wickedness. But before he was a mighty prophet, Enoch saw himself as “but a lad, … slow of speech,” and hated by all the people (Moses 6:31). Listen to the words the Lord used to encourage Enoch. They are also His words to you who are called to minister to others as a priesthood holder:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,21,"“And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance, for allflesh is in my hands, and I will do as seemeth me good. …"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,22,"“Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me” (Moses 6:32, 34)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,23,"Brethren, our ordination to the priesthood is an invitation from the Lord to walk with Him. And what does it mean to walk with the Lord? It means to do what He does, to serve the way He serves. He sacrificed His own comforts to bless those in need, so that’s what we try to do. He seemed to take particular notice of people who were overlooked and even shunned by society, so we should try to do that too. He testified boldly yet lovingly of the true doctrine He received from His Father, even if it was unpopular, and so must we. He said to all, “Come unto me” (Matthew 11:28), and we say to all, “Come unto Him.” As priesthood holders, we are His representatives. We act not for ourselves but for Him. We speak not our words but His. The people we serve come to know Him better because of our service."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,24,"As soon as we accept the Lord’s invitation “Walk with me,” the nature of our priesthood service changes. It becomes all at once higher and nobler but also more achievable, because we know that we are not alone. I felt this most powerfully when President Thomas S. Monson laid his hands on my head nine years ago and blessed me as I began my service in my current calling. In that blessing, he recited these words of the Savior: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up” (D&C 84:88)."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,25,"I have relied upon that promise many times, and I have seen it fulfilled in many ways throughout my 72 years of priesthood service. It happened when I was a new Aaronic Priesthood holder with an assignment to pass the sacrament. Terrified that I would make a mistake, I went outside the chapel before the meeting started and prayed in desperation that God would help me. An answer came. I felt that the Lord was with me. I felt His confidence in me, and so I felt confidence in my part in His work."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,26,"It happened again while I was serving as a bishop. I received a phone call from a woman who had made a serious mistake and now faced a difficult, life-changing decision. As I visited with her, I felt I knew the answer to her problem, but I also felt strongly thatIshould not give her that answer—she needed to obtain it for herself. My words to her were “I believe God will tell you what to do if you would ask Him.” She later reported that she did ask Him and He did tell her."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,27,"On another occasion a phone call came when I was a bishop—this time from the police. I was told that a drunk driver had crashed his car through the glass into the lobby of a bank. When the bewildered driver saw the security guard with his weapon brandished, he cried, “Don’t shoot! I’m a Mormon!”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,28,"The inebriated driver was discovered to be a member of my ward, baptized only recently. As I waited to speak to him in the bishop’s office, I planned what I would say to make him feel remorseful for the way he had broken his covenants and embarrassed the Church. But as I sat looking at him, I heard a voice in my mind say, just as clearly as if someone were speaking to me, “I’m going to let you see him as I see him.” And then, for a brief moment, his whole appearance changed to me. I saw not a dazed young man but a bright, noble son of God. I suddenly felt the Lord’s love for him. That vision changed our conversation. It also changed me."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,29,I learned important lessons from these experiences walking with the Lord in doing His work. I would like to share with you three of them. The first is that God notices and will support even the newest and youngest deacon. You need never feel that you are too small or too insignificant for Him to take notice of you and the service you are giving in His name.
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,30,"The second lesson is that the Lord’s work is not just to solve problems; it is to build people. So as you walk with Him in priesthood service, you may find that sometimes what seems like the most efficient solution is not the Lord’s preferred solution because it does not allow people to grow. If you listen, He will teach you His ways. Remember that God’s work and glory is not simply to run an effective organization; it is “to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). This is, after all, why He gives His priesthood authority to flawed mortals like you and me and invites us to participate in His work. Our progressisHis work!"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,31,"Now the third lesson: Walking with the Savior in priesthood service will change the way you look at others. He will teach you to see them through His eyes, which means seeing past an outward appearance and into the heart (see1 Samuel 16:7). This is how the Savior was able to see Simon not as an impulsive fisherman but as Peter, the rock-solid future leader of His Church (seeLuke 5:1–11). This is how He was able to see Zacchaeus not as the corrupt tax collector others saw but as an honest, upright son of Abraham (seeLuke 19:1–9). If you walk with the Savior long enough, you will learn to see everyone as a child of God with limitless potential, regardless of what his or her past may have been. And if you continue walking with the Savior, you will develop another gift He has—the ability to help people see that potential in themselves and so repent."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,32,"My dear brethren of the priesthood, in many ways, we are like the two disciples who walked the road to Emmaus on that first Easter Sunday. It was Resurrection morning, but they were not yet sure there was a resurrection or what resurrection even meant. They had “trusted that [Jesus of Nazareth] should have redeemed Israel,” but they were “slow of heart to believe” everything the scriptures taught about resurrection. As they walked along and tried to reason it out together, “Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.” (SeeLuke 24:13–32.)"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,33,"I testify that when we walk the path of priesthood service, the Savior Jesus Christ goes with us, for it is His path, His way. His light goes before us, and His angels are round about us. We may lack a full understanding of what the priesthood is or how to exercise it as He does. But if we pay close attention to those moments when our hearts “burn within us” (Luke 24:32), our eyes can be opened and we will see His hand in our lives and in our service. I testify that we come to know Him best by working with Him and serving Him in the great work of bringing salvation to God’s children. “For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?” (Mosiah 5:13). Jesus Christ is our Master. This is His Church. It is His priesthood which we hold. May we each choose to walk with Him and to recognize how He walks with us."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/walk-with-me,President Henry B. Eyring,34,"I give you my solemn witness that Jesus is the Christ, our resurrected Lord. I bear you my testimony that the priesthood He has trusted us with is the power to speak and to act in His name. We are children of a loving Heavenly Father who answers our prayers and sends the Holy Ghost to strengthen us in every priesthood responsibility we are blessed to receive. Joseph Smith saw the Father and the Son. He received the keys of the priesthood, which have been passed on to President Thomas S. Monson, who exercises them today. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,4,"The Savior performed His first recorded miracle at a wedding feast in Cana of Galilee. Mary, His mother, and His disciples were there as well. Mary apparently felt some responsibility for the success of the feast. During the celebration, a problem arose—the wedding hosts ran out of wine. Mary was concerned and went to Jesus. They spoke briefly; then Mary turned to the servants and said:"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,5,"“Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,6,"“And there were set there six waterpots of stone. … [These waterpots weren’t used to store drinking water but were used for ceremonial washings under the law of Moses.]"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,7,"“Jesus saith unto [the servants], Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,8,"“And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,9,"“[Then] the ruler of the feast … tasted the water that was made wine” and expressed surprise that the best wine was served so late in the feast."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,10,"We usually remember this event because transforming water to wine was a demonstration of the power of God—it was a miracle. That is an important message, but there is another important message in John’s account. Mary was “a precious and chosen vessel,”called by God to give birth to, nurture, and raise the very Son of God. She knew more about Him than anyone else on earth. She knew the truth of His miraculous birth. She knew that He was sinless and that He “spake not as other men, neither could he be taught; for he needed not that any man should teach him.”Mary knew of His extraordinary capacity to solve problems, including one as personal as providing wine for a wedding feast. She had unshakable confidence in Him and in His divine power. Her simple, straightforward instruction to the servants had no caveats, no qualifications, no limitations: “Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,11,"Mary had been a young woman when the angel Gabriel appeared unto her. At first she had been “troubled” by being called “highly favoured” and “blessed … among women … and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.” Gabriel reassured her that she had nothing to fear—the news he brought was good. She would “conceive in [her] womb … the Son of the Highest” and “bring forth a son … [who] shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,12,"Mary wondered aloud, “How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,13,"The angel explained but only briefly, affirming to her that “with God nothing [is] impossible.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,14,"Mary humbly responded that she would do what God asked, without demanding to know specifics and undoubtedly in spite of having countless questions about the implications for her life. She committed herself without exactly understanding why He was asking that of her or how things would work out. She accepted God’s word unconditionally and in advance,with little knowledge of what lay ahead. With simple trust in God, Mary said, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,15,"When we decide to do “whatsoever [God] saith unto” us, we earnestly commit to align our everyday behavior with God’s will. Such simple acts of faith as studying the scriptures daily, fasting regularly, and praying with real intent deepen our well of spiritual capacity to meet the demands of mortality. Overtime, simple habits of belief lead to miraculous results. They transform our faith from a seedling into a dynamic power for good in our lives. Then, when challenges come our way, our rootedness in Christ provides steadfastness for our souls. God shores up our weaknesses, increases our joys, and causes “all things [to] work together for [our] good.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,16,"A few years ago, I spoke with a young bishop who was spending hours each week counseling with members of his ward. He made a striking observation. The problems that members of his ward faced, he said, were those faced by Church members everywhere—issues such as how to establish a happy marriage; struggles with balancing work, family, and Church duties; challenges with the Word of Wisdom, with employment, or with pornography; or trouble gaining peace about a Church policy or historical question they didn’t understand."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,17,"His counsel to ward members very often included getting back to simple practices of faith, such as studying the Book of Mormon—as we were counseled by President Thomas S. Monson to do—paying tithing, and serving in the Church with devotion. Frequently, however, their response to him was one of skepticism: “I don’t agree with you, Bishop. Weallknow those are good things to do. We talk about those thingsall the timein the Church. But I’m not sure you’re understanding me. What does doing any ofthosethings have to do with the issuesI’mfacing?”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,18,"It’s a fair question. Over time, that young bishop and I have observed that those who are deliberate about doing the “small and simple things”—obeying in seemingly little ways—are blessed with faith and strength that go far beyond the actual acts of obedience themselves and, in fact, may seem totally unrelated to them. It may seem hard to draw a connection between the basic daily acts of obedience and solutions to the big, complicated problems we face. But theyarerelated. In my experience, getting the little daily habits of faith right is the single best way to fortify ourselves against the troubles of life, whatever they may be. Small acts of faith, even when they seem insignificant or entirely disconnected from the specific problems that vex us, bless us inallwe do."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,19,"Consider Naaman, a “captain of the host of … Syria, … a mighty man in valour,” and a leper. A servant girl told of a prophet in Israel who could heal Naaman, and so he traveled with an escort of servants, soldiers, and gifts to Israel, eventually arriving at Elisha’s house. Elisha’s servant, not Elisha himself, informed Naaman that the Lord’s command was to “go and wash in [the river] Jordan seven times.” A simple thing. Perhaps this simple prescription struck the mighty warrior as so illogical, simplistic, or beneath his dignity that he found the mere suggestion offensive. At the very least, Elisha’s instruction didn’t make sense to Naaman, “so he turned and went away in a rage.”"
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,20,"But Naaman’s servants gently approached him and observed that he would have done “some great thing” if Elisha had asked it of him. They noted that since he was asked to do only a small task, shouldn’t he do it, even if he didn’t understand why? Naaman reconsidered his reaction and perhaps skeptically, but obediently, “went … down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan” and was miraculously healed."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,21,"Some rewards of obedience do come quickly; others come only after we are tested. In the Pearl of Great Price, we read about Adam’s tireless diligence in keeping the commandment to offer sacrifices. When the angel asked Adam why he was offering sacrifices, he answered, “I know not, save the Lord commanded me.” The angel explained that his sacrifices were “a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father.” But that explanation came only after Adam had demonstrated his commitment to obeying the Lord for “many days” withoutknowingwhyhe was supposed to offer those sacrifices."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,22,"God will always bless us for our steadfast obedience to His gospel and loyalty to His Church, but He rarely shows us His timetable for doing so in advance. He doesn’t show us the whole picture from the outset. That is where faith, hope, and trusting in the Lord come in."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,23,"God asks us to bear with Him—to trust Him and to follow Him. He pleads with us to “dispute not because ye see not.” He cautions us that we shouldn’t expect easy answers or quick fixes from heaven. Things work out when we stand firm during the “trial of [our] faith,” however hard that test may be to endure or slow the answer may be in coming.I am not speaking of “blind obedience”but of thoughtful confidence in the perfect love and the perfect timing of the Lord."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,24,"The trial of our faith willalwaysinvolve staying true to simple, daily practices of faith. Then, and only then, does He promise that we will receive the divine response for which we long. Only once we have proven our willingness to do what He asks without demanding to know the whens, the whys, and the hows do we “reap the rewards of [our] faith, and [our] diligence, and patience, and long-suffering.”Real obedience accepts God’s commandments unconditionally and in advance."
  2017,"04",/general-conference/2017/04/whatsoever-he-saith-unto-you-do-it,Elder L. Whitney Clayton,25,"Every day, consciously or otherwise, we all choose “whom [we] will serve.”We demonstrate our determination to serve the Lord by faithfully engaging in daily acts of devotion. The Lord promises to direct our paths,but for Him to do that, we have to walk, trusting that He knows the way because Heis“the way.”We must fill our own waterpots up to the brim. When we trust and follow Him, our lives, like water to wine, are transformed. We become something more and better than we ever otherwise could be. Trust in the Lord, and “whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.” In the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
