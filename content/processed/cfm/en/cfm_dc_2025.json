For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond a classroom into an individual’s heart and home. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. True conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."

If you already have a good habit of scripture study, this resource can help you have more meaningful experiences.",
        "The ideal place to learn the gospel is at home. Your teachers at church can support you, and you can get encouragement from other ward members.

Your most important preparation will occur as you search the scriptures and seek personal inspiration from the Holy Ghost. You could also study with the needs of the people you teach in mind. Look for eternal truths. Come, Follow Me can help you identify some of these truths and learn how the scriptures can be applied in your life.",

In other words, your main responsibility is to support the people you teach in their efforts to learn and live the gospel at home.

        "The scriptures are the word of God, so ask Him for help to understand them.",
        "All things testify of Christ (see 2 Nephi 11:4 ; Moses 6:63 ), so consider noting or marking verses that testify of the Savior, deepen your love for Him, and teach how to follow Him. Sometimes truths about the Savior and His gospel are stated directly, and sometimes they are implied through an example or story. Ask yourself, “What eternal truths are taught in these verses? What do these truths teach me about the Savior?”",
        "Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings, even if they are unrelated to what you are reading. These impressions may be what your Heavenly Father wants you to learn.",
        "There are many ways to record the impressions that come as you study. For example, you may find that certain words and phrases in the scriptures impress you; you could mark them and record your thoughts as a note in your scriptures. You could also keep a journal of the insights, feelings, and impressions you receive.",
        "Discussing insights from your personal study is a good way to teach others, and it also helps strengthen your understanding of what you have read. Share what you’re learning with family members and friends (in person or digitally), and invite them to do the same.",
        "Consider how the stories and teachings you are reading apply to your life. For example, you could ask yourself, “What experiences have I had that are similar to what I am reading?”",
        "As you study the scriptures, questions may come to mind. These questions might relate to what you are reading or to your life in general. Ponder these questions and look for answers as you continue studying the scriptures.",
        "To gain additional insights into the verses you read, use the footnotes, the Topical Guide , the Bible Dictionary , the Guide to the Scriptures , and other study helps.",
        "You can find meaningful insights about a scripture passage as you consider its context, including the circumstances or setting it came from. For example, knowing the background and beliefs of the people God spoke to can help you better understand the intent of His words. You can learn about them in Saints , Revelations in Context , the section headings in the Doctrine and Covenants, and other resources.",
        "Read what latter-day prophets and apostles have taught about the principles you find in the scriptures.",
        "Scripture study should not only inspire us but also lead us to change the way we live. Listen to what the Spirit prompts you to do as you read, and then act on these promptings.",
        "Suggested hymns and children’s songs are found throughout Come, Follow Me . Use sacred music to invite the Spirit and to deepen your faith and testimony of gospel truths.",
        "Select a scripture passage that is meaningful to you, your family, or your class, and memorize it by repeating it daily or by playing a memorization game.",
        "Find objects that relate to the chapters and verses that you are reading. Consider how each object relates to the teachings in the scriptures.",
        "Read a few verses, and then draw something that relates to what you read. Or you could look for a picture in the Gospel Art Book or elsewhere in the Gospel Library. You could also take a picture that illustrates what you learned.",
        "After reading a story, invite family or class members to act it out. Afterward, talk about how the story relates to the things that you are experiencing.",
        "If you have family members who aren’t willing to participate in family scripture study, look for other ways to connect with them. For example, could you share eternal truth naturally in your conversations or share a meaningful scripture in a way that doesn’t seem preachy or overbearing? Scripture study doesn’t have to look the same in every family. Some children may respond better to studying the scriptures one on one. Be prayerful and follow the promptings of the Spirit."

That’s the question the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles pondered as April 2020 approached, marking 200 years since Joseph Smith’s First Vision. “We wondered if a monument should be erected,” President Russell M. Nelson recalled. “But as we considered the unique historic and international impact of that First Vision, we felt impressed to create a monument not of granite or stone but of words … , not to be carved in ‘tables of stone’ but rather to be etched in the ‘fleshy tables’ of our hearts [\n2 Corinthians 3:3\n]” (“\nHear Him\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 90).\nThe monument of words they created is titled “\nThe Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World\n.” It’s a monument not just to the First Vision but also to everything Jesus Christ has done—and is still doing—since then. The Restoration of His gospel started when one person turned to God and heard Him. It continues that same way: one heart, one sacred experience at a time—including yours.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n“God loves His children in every nation of the world.”\nIn your opinion, why would a proclamation about the Restoration begin with a statement about God’s love? As you study the proclamation, look for expressions of God’s love for “His children in every nation of the world.” How has the Restoration of the gospel helped you feel His love?\nSee also Gerrit W. Gong, “\nAll Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 38–41.\nThe Restoration began with an answer to a question.\nIt could be said that the Savior started the Restoration of His gospel by responding to a question. What message do you feel the\nRestoration proclamation\nhas for a person with questions about God, the gospel, or “the salvation of his [or her] soul”? You might also study\nJoseph Smith—History 1:5–20\nto see what you can learn from Joseph Smith about finding answers to gospel questions.\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nSeeking Answers\n,” Gospel Library.\nDetail from\nThe Desires of My Heart\n, by Walter Rane\nJesus Christ has restored His Church.\nWhat do you know about “Christ’s New Testament Church,” which the Savior restored through Joseph Smith? Consider studying these scriptures and listing some features of His Church:\nMatthew 16:15–19\nMark 16:15–18\nLuke 6:12–13\nActs 4:34–35\n1 Corinthians 15:29\nEphesians 4:11–15\nNext, you could match the scriptures above with those below, which describe how Jesus Christ restored those features of His Church through Joseph Smith:\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:37–38\n;\n107:23–24\nDoctrine and Covenants 51:3\n;\n70:14\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:64–72\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:11–16\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:31, 36\nArticles of Faith 1:6\nWhy are you grateful for the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ?\nElder Jeffrey R. Holland and his wife once tried to imagine how they would have felt living before the Church was restored. “What do we wish we had?” they asked themselves. Read about their experiences in “\nA Perfect Brightness of Hope\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 81–82). How has the Restoration helped fulfill your spiritual hopes?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nApostasy and the Restoration of the Gospel\n,” Gospel Library.\n“The promised Restoration goes forward.”\nHave you ever thought of yourself as part of the Restoration of the gospel? Consider these words from President Dieter F. Uchtdorf: “Sometimes we think of the Restoration of the gospel as something that is complete, already behind us. … In reality, the Restoration is an ongoing process; we are living in it right now” (“\nAre You Sleeping through the Restoration?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2014, 59).\nAs you prepare to study how the gospel was restored in the 1800s, you might start by pondering how it was restored in your life. Read the\nRestoration proclamation\nwith questions like these in mind: How have I come to know that this is true? How do I participate in the Restoration today?\n“The heavens are open.”\nWhat does the phrase “the heavens are open” mean to you? What evidence do you see—in the\nRestoration proclamation\n, in the Church today, in the scriptures, and in your life—that the heavens truly are open?\nYou might also include “\nThe Morning Breaks\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 1) as part of your study. What do you find in this hymn that adds to your understanding of the phrase “the heavens are open”?\nSee also Quentin L. Cook, “\nThe Blessing of Continuing Revelation to Prophets and Personal Revelation to Guide Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 96–100.\nLearn together.\nPresident Nelson invited us to “study [the Restoration proclamation] privately and with [our] family members and friends” (“\nHear Him\n,” 92). Consider how you might include others in your study.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n“We solemnly proclaim.”\nAs you read parts of the\nRestoration proclamation\nwith your children (or watch the video of President Nelson reading it), help them find sentences that begin with phrases like “we proclaim,” “we declare,” or “we testify.” What truths are our prophets and apostles declaring? Perhaps you and your children could share your own testimonies of some of these same truths.\nThe Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ\n“Joseph Smith … had questions.”\nIt might be interesting to your children to explore some of the questions Joseph Smith had that led to the Restoration of the Savior’s gospel. Help them find some examples in\nJoseph Smith—History 1:10, 29, 68\n. How are we blessed today because God answered Joseph Smith’s questions?\nYou might also give your children a chance to talk about questions they have. What do we learn from Joseph Smith about how to find answers? (see\nJoseph Smith—History 1:8–17\n; see also verses 3 and 4 of “\nThis Is My Beloved Son\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 76).\n“Heavenly messengers came to instruct Joseph.”\nWho were the “heavenly messengers [who] came to instruct Joseph”? Your children might enjoy looking for pictures of them in the\nGospel Art Book\n(see nos.\n91\n,\n93\n,\n94\n,\n95\n). How did each of these messengers help “re-establish the Church of Jesus Christ”?

Though growing, it was still a little-known group of believers living in relatively small towns, led by a prophet in his mid-twenties. But God considered these believers to be His servants and His messengers, and He wanted the revelations He had given them to be published to the world.\nDoctrine and Covenants section 1\nis the Lord’s preface, or introduction, to these revelations. It clearly shows that even though the membership of the Church was small, there was nothing small about the message God wanted His Saints to share. It is a “voice of warning” for all “the inhabitants of the earth,” teaching them to repent and establish God’s “everlasting covenant” (\nverses 4, 8, 22\n). The servants carrying this message are “the weak and the simple.” But humble servants are just what God calls for—then and now—to bring His Church “out of obscurity and out of darkness” (\nverses 23, 30\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 1\n“Hearken, O ye people.”\nA preface introduces a book. It identifies the book’s themes and purposes and helps readers prepare to read. As you read\nsection 1\n—the Lord’s “preface” to the Doctrine and Covenants (\nverse 6\n)—look for the themes and purposes the Lord gave for His revelations. What do you learn that will help you in your study of the Doctrine and Covenants this year? For example, you might ponder what it means to “hear the voice of the Lord” in these revelations (\nverse 14\n) or to “search these commandments” (\nverse 37\n).\nSee also the\nintroduction to the Doctrine and Covenants\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:4–6, 23–24, 37–39\nThe Lord speaks through His servants, including latter-day prophets.\nSection 1\nbegins and ends with the Lord’s declaration that He speaks through His chosen servants (see\nverses 4–6, 23–24, 38\n). Write down what you learn from this revelation about:\nThe Lord and His voice.\nWhy prophets are needed in our day.\nWhat do you feel impressed to do as a result of what you find?\nWhen have you heard the Lord’s voice through the voice of His servants? (see\nverse 38\n).\nYou could also imagine that a friend who doesn’t know about living prophets is reading\nsection 1\nwith you. What questions might your friend have? Which verses would you want to discuss with your friend to help him or her understand how you feel about having prophets in our day?\nYou might be interested to know that when a council of elders met in 1831 to talk about publishing Joseph Smith’s revelations, some people opposed the idea. They were embarrassed by Joseph’s weakness in writing, and they worried that publishing the revelations might cause more problems for the Saints (see\nSaints\n,\n1:140–43\n). If you had been a member of this council, how would you have addressed these concerns? What insights do you find in\nsection 1\nthat might have helped? (see, for example,\nverses 6, 24, 38\n).\nConsider including a hymn like “\nCome, Listen to a Prophet’s Voice\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 21) in your study and worship. Look for phrases in the hymn that teach the same principles as verses in\nsection 1\n.\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nProphets\n,” Gospel Library.\nThe Lord speaks to us through His servants, the prophets.\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:12–30, 34–36\nThe Restoration helps me face the challenges of the latter days.\nIn\nDoctrine and Covenants section 1\n, the Lord explains why He restored His gospel. See how many reasons you can list as you read\nverses 12–23\n. In your experience, how are the Lord’s purposes for the Restoration being accomplished?\nThe Lord knew that our day would have serious challenges (see\nverse 17\n). What do you find in\nverses 17–30, 34–36\nthat helps you feel peace and confidence despite these challenges?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nEmbrace the Future with Faith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 73–76.\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:19–28\nThe Lord uses “the weak and the simple” to accomplish His work.\nAs you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:19–28\n, you might ponder what it means to be a servant of the Lord. What characteristics does the Lord want His servants to have? What is the Lord accomplishing through His servants? How are the prophecies in these verses being fulfilled throughout the world and in your life?\nProclaimed by the Weak and the Simple\nLook for Jesus Christ.\nThe purpose of the scriptures is to testify of the Savior and His gospel. As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 1\n, consider marking or noting verses that teach you something about Jesus Christ.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nJoseph Smith Jr.\nBook of Commandments\nDoctrine and Covenants\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:4, 37–39\nThrough His prophets, the Lord warns me of spiritual danger.\nTo start a discussion about warnings from the Lord, you could talk about warnings we receive from other people about dangers we cannot see.

      "plain_text": "“January 13–19: ‘I Saw a Pillar of Light’: Joseph Smith—History 1:1–26,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Doctrine and Covenants 2025\n(2025)\n“Joseph Smith—History 1:1–26,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2025\nSacred Grove\n, by Greg Olsen\nJanuary 13–19: “I Saw a Pillar of Light”\nJoseph Smith—History 1:1–26\nYou might say the Doctrine and Covenants is a book of answers to prayers: many of the sacred revelations in this book came in response to questions. The question that began it all—the one that sparked the latter-day outpouring of revelation—was asked by a 14-year-old boy. A “war of words and tumult of opinions” (\nJoseph Smith—History 1:10\n) had left Joseph Smith confused about religion and his relationship with God. Perhaps you can relate to that. We find many conflicting ideas and persuasive voices in our day. When we want to sort through these messages and find truth, we can do what Joseph did. We can ask questions, study the scriptures, ponder, and ultimately ask God. In response to Joseph’s prayer, a pillar of light descended from heaven. God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared and answered his questions. Joseph’s testimony of that miraculous experience boldly declares that anyone “who [lacks] wisdom might ask of God, and obtain” (\nJoseph Smith—History 1:26\n). We can all receive, if not a heavenly vision, at least a clearer vision, illuminated by heavenly light.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJoseph Smith—History 1:5–26\nJoseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration.\nThe purpose of Joseph Smith’s history was to put us “in possession of the facts” because the truth about Joseph has often been distorted (\nJoseph Smith—History 1:1\n). As you read\nJoseph Smith—History 1:1–26\n, what strengthens your testimony of his divine calling?\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:3–19\n.\nJoseph Smith—History 1:5–25\nHow can I receive answers to my prayers?\nHave you ever “lacked wisdom” or felt confused about a decision you needed to make? (\nJoseph Smith—History 1:13\n). The experience Joseph Smith had in 1820 can serve as a good pattern for your own personal revelation. For example, as you search\nJoseph Smith—History 1:5–25\n, look for experiences you can relate to. What do you learn about:\nHow Joseph prepared for a sacred experience in prayer? (see\nverses 8, 11, 14–15\n).\nThe role of scripture study in seeking revelation? (see\nverses 11–12\n).\nWhat to do when you face opposition? (see\nverses 15–16\n,\n21–26\n).\nAccepting and acting on answers you receive? (see\nverses 18–25\n).\nInvite sharing.\nSearching the scriptures invites impressions from the Holy Ghost. Sharing these impressions can invite the Holy Ghost to bear witness to others, as well as to the individual who is sharing.\nWhat additional insights can you gain from President Henry B. Eyring’s article “\nThe First Vision: A Pattern for Personal Revelation\n”? (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Feb. 2020, 12–17).\nYou might also look for other examples in the scriptures of people communicating with God. Images in the\nGospel Art Book\nor other\nCome, Follow Me\nbooks could give you ideas. Try answering the questions listed previously for each example you find. What experiences have you had receiving answers to prayer? What can you do to help others have good experiences as well?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nHear Him\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 88–92; Topics and Questions, “Personal Revelation,” Gospel Library.\nJoseph Smith—History 1:15–20\nJoseph Smith saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.\nJoseph Smith trusted that God would answer his prayer, but he didn’t anticipate how that answer would change his life—and the world. As you read about Joseph’s experience, ponder how the results of the First Vision have changed your life.\nFor example, the First Vision revealed several truths about God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, that were different from what many people in Joseph’s day believed. As you read\nJoseph Smith—History 1:15–20\n, consider writing down different ways to complete a statement like this one: “Because the First Vision happened, I know that …”\nWhat feelings do you have as you ponder Joseph’s experience and everything that came of it?\nSee also “Ask of God: Joseph Smith’s First Vision” (video), Gospel Library; “\nJoseph Smith’s First Prayer\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 26.\nAsk of God: Joseph Smith's First Vision\nDetail from\nIf Any of You Lack Wisdom\n, by Walter Rane\nJoseph Smith—History 1:15–20\nWhy are there various accounts of the First Vision?\nDuring his life, Joseph Smith recorded his experience in the Sacred Grove at least four times, often using a scribe. In addition, several accounts were written by other people who heard Joseph talk about his vision. Although these accounts differ in some details, depending on the author, audience, and setting, they are otherwise consistent. And each account adds details that help us better understand Joseph Smith’s experience, just as each of the four New Testament Gospels helps us better understand the Savior’s ministry.\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nFirst Vision Accounts\n,” Gospel Library.\nJoseph Smith—History 1:21–26\nI can remain true to what I know, even if others reject me.\nAfter his remarkable First Vision, Joseph Smith naturally wanted to share his experience with others. The opposition he faced surprised him. As you read his account, what inspires you to remain true to your testimony? What other examples—from the scriptures, an ancestor, or people you know—give you courage to stay true to the spiritual experiences you have had?\nSee also Gary E. Stevenson, “\nNourishing and Bearing Your Testimony\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 111–14.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nLucy Mack Smith\nThe Sacred Grove\nJoseph Smith’s First Vision Accounts\nChristian Churches in Joseph Smith’s Day\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJoseph Smith—History 1:3–14\nJoseph Smith was prepared to be a prophet of God.\nLearning about Joseph Smith’s youth could help your children relate to him as they learn from his experiences.

I said but little upon the subject of religion although it occupied my mind entirely, and I thought that I would make all diligence as soon as I was able to seek some pious person who knew the ways of God to instruct me in things of Heaven.”\nWilliam Smith\n“My mother, who was a very pious woman and much interested in the welfare of her children, both here and hereafter, made use of every means which her parental love could suggest, to get us engaged in seeking for our souls’ salvation, or (as the term then was) ‘in getting religion.’ She prevailed on us to attend the meetings, and almost the whole family became interested in the matter, and seekers after truth.”\n“We always had family prayers since I can remember. I well remember father used to carry his spectacles in his vest pocket, … and when us boys saw him feel for his specs, we knew that was a signal to get ready for prayer, and if we did not notice it mother would say, ‘William,’ or whoever was the negligent one, ‘get ready for prayer.’ After the prayer we had a song we would sing.”\nJoseph Sr. and Lucy Smith taught their family to study the scriptures.\nJoseph Smith\n“I now say, that [my father] never did a mean act that might be said was ungenerous, in his life, to my knowledge. I loved my father and his memory; and the memory of his noble deeds, rest with ponderous weight upon my mind; and many of his kind and parental words to me, are written on the tablet of my heart. Sacred to me, are the thoughts which I cherish of the history of his life, that have rolled through my mind and has been implanted there, by my own observation since I was born. … My mother also is one of the noblest, and the best of all women.”\nNotes\nJournal, December 1841–December 1842, 180\n,\njosephsmithpapers.org\n.\nLucy Mack Smith, History, 1844–1845, book 2, pages 2–4\n,\njosephsmithpapers.org\n; spelling and punctuation standardized.\nWilliam Smith on Mormonism: A True Account of the Origin of the Book of Mormon\n(1883), 6.\nJ. W.

He began to wonder whether the Lord was displeased with him. Like all of us, he had made mistakes, and he felt condemned by them. Yet God still had a work for him to do. And the work Joseph was called to do is connected to what God asks of us. Joseph would bring forth the Book of Mormon; we are invited to share its message. Joseph would receive priesthood keys to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers; we can now receive ordinances for our ancestors in temples. Joseph was told of prophecies that would soon be fulfilled; we are called to help fulfill these prophecies. As we take part in God’s work, we can expect to face opposition and even persecution, just as the Prophet did. But we can also have faith that the Lord will make us instruments in His hands, just as He did for Joseph.\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:20–48\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJoseph Smith—History 1:27–33\nGod has a work for me to do.\nIt’s one thing to believe that God had a work for Joseph Smith to do—we can look back on his life and clearly see what he accomplished.

Seeking your ancestors and performing ordinances for them in the temple is one way (see\nFamilySearch.org\n). What others can you think of?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:13–16\n; Gerrit W.

You and your children could study\nJoseph Smith—History 1:29\ntogether, looking for what Joseph did when he felt that way. What can we learn from his example that can help us when we make mistakes? Why is it important to know that Joseph was called by God even though he was not perfect?\nJoseph Smith—History 1:27–54\nHeavenly Father called Joseph Smith to help Him do His work.\nYour children might have fun pretending to be Joseph Smith as you tell the account of Moroni’s visits in\nJoseph Smith—History 1:27–54\nor “\nChapter 3: The Angel Moroni and the Gold Plates\n” (in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n,\n13–17\n, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). For example, they could fold their arms like they are praying or pretend to climb the Hill Cumorah, and so on. Then you could ask them to talk about what God called Joseph Smith to do and how we are blessed as a result. For example, how have we been blessed because Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon?

You could then read\nDoctrine and Covenants 2\nand share with each other your thoughts about why we have temples and why Heavenly Father wants families to be together forever. Consider singing together “\nFamilies Can Be Together Forever\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 188).

But one thing his early experiences taught him was that to do God’s work, his eye must be “single to the glory of God” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 4:1, 5\n). For example, if the Lord counseled him to do something he wasn’t sure he wanted to do, he needed to follow the Lord’s counsel. And even if he had “many revelations, and … power to do many mighty works,” if he felt that what he wanted was more important than God’s will, he “must fall” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:4\n). But Joseph learned something else just as important about doing God’s work: “God is merciful,” and if Joseph sincerely repented, he was “still chosen” (\nverse 10\n). God’s work is, after all, a work of redemption. And that work “cannot be frustrated” (\nverse 1\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:1–16\nI can trust God.\nEarly in Joseph Smith’s ministry, good friends were hard to find—especially friends like Martin Harris, a respected, prosperous man who made great sacrifices to support Joseph’s work. So when Martin asked for permission to show the first 116 manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon translation to his wife, Joseph naturally wanted to honor his request, even though the Lord had warned against it. Tragically, the pages were lost while in Martin’s possession, and Joseph and Martin were sharply chastised by the Lord (see\nSaints\n,\n1:51–53\n).\nAs you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:1–15\n, ponder what the Lord wants you to learn from their experience. For example, what do you learn about:\nGod’s work? (see\nverses 1–3, 16\n).\nThe consequences of fearing man rather than trusting God? (see\nverses 4–8\n).\nThe blessings that come from remaining faithful? (see\nverse 8\n).\nThe way the Lord both corrected and encouraged Joseph? (see\nverses 9–16\n).\nIn his message “\nWhich Way Do You Face?\n,” Elder Lynn G. Robbins gives many scriptural examples of people who feared God and people who gave in to pressure from others (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2014, 9–11).

However, it’s interesting to note that this revelation was given to Joseph Smith Sr., who wasn’t being called on a mission but still had “desires to serve God” (\nverse 3\n).\nOne way to read this section is to imagine it as a job description for someone who wants to help with the Lord’s work. What is the Lord looking for? What benefits does He offer?\nWhat do you learn about serving the Lord from this revelation?\nPresident Russell M. Nelson called the gathering of Israel “the\ngreatest\nchallenge, the\ngreatest\ncause, and the\ngreatest\nwork on earth” (“\nHope of Israel\n” [worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018], Gospel Library).

So Martin asked Joseph for more evidence that the gold plates were real.\nDoctrine and Covenants 5\nis a revelation in response to Martin’s request. What do you learn from this section about the following:\nWhat the Lord says would happen if the gold plates were displayed for the world to see (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 5:7\n). Why do you think that’s the case?\nThe role of witnesses in the work of the Lord (see\nverses 11–15\n; see also\n2 Corinthians 13:1\n).\nHow to gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon for yourself (see\nverses 16, 24\n; see also\nMoroni 10:3–5\n).\nDoctrine and Covenants 5:1–10\nJesus Christ gave us His word through Joseph Smith.\nWhat does\nDoctrine and Covenants 5:1–10\nteach you about Joseph Smith’s role in our day—and in your life?

You could then role-play with your children situations when they might be tempted to do something they know isn’t right. What words or phrases in\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:5–8\n;\n5:21–22\ncould help them during these situations?\nMartin Harris Helps Joseph: Learning to trust the Lord\nDoctrine and Covenants 4\nThe Lord invites me to help with His work.\nEach verse in\nDoctrine and Covenants 4\ncontains precious truths that can help your children learn about serving God. Here are some ideas to help them discover these truths:\nYou could read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 4:1\nand show pictures that depict God’s “marvelous” latter-day work (such as missionaries, temples, and the Book of Mormon).\nYour children could think of actions or draw pictures depicting the phrase “serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 4:2\n).\nYou could look together at tools that are used to work in a field. How do these tools help us? Then your children could find things in\nDoctrine and Covenants 4:5–6\nthat are like tools for doing God’s work.\nOlder children could search\nDoctrine and Covenants 4\non their own and make a list of things they learn about what it means to serve God.\nYou could sing together a song about missionary work, such as “\nI Want to Be a Missionary Now\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 168).\nI can help with God’s work by serving others.\nAdapt activities to accommodate people with disabilities.\nSmall adaptations to activities can ensure that everyone has an opportunity to learn. For instance, if an activity suggests showing a picture, you could sing a song instead to include people with visual impairments.\nDoctrine and Covenants 5:1–7, 11, 16, 23–24\nI can be a witness that the Book of Mormon is true.\nTo teach your children about witnesses, you could ask them to imagine that a friend told them they saw a cat walking on its front legs. Would they believe it? What if another friend said the same thing? Talk about what a “witness” is and why witnesses are important. You could then help your children search\nDoctrine and Covenants 5:1–3, 7, 11\nfor answers to questions like these:\nWhat did Martin Harris want to know?\nWho could Joseph Smith show the gold plates to?\nWhy would seeing the plates probably not convince someone the Book of Mormon is true?\nWhat can we do to be witnesses of the Book of Mormon? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 5:16\n;\nMoroni 10:3–5\n).\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nDevastating Weight of 116 Pages\n, by Kwani Povi Winder\nOpen PDF"

The Smiths described visits from angels, an ancient record, and the gift to translate by the power of God. Oliver was fascinated. Could it be true? Lucy and Joseph Sr. gave him advice that applies to anyone seeking truth: pray and ask the Lord.\nOliver did, and the Lord answered, speaking “peace to [his] mind” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:23\n). Revelation, Oliver discovered, isn’t just for prophets like Joseph Smith. It’s for anyone who wants it and seeks it diligently. Oliver still had a lot to learn, but he knew enough to take his next step. He knew the Lord was doing something important through Joseph Smith, and Oliver wanted to be part of it.\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:58–64\n; “Days of Harmony” (video), Gospel Library.\nDays of Harmony\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 6\n;\n8–9\nHeavenly Father speaks to me through the Holy Ghost.\nIn the spring of 1829, Oliver Cowdery volunteered to be Joseph Smith’s scribe as he continued to translate the Book of Mormon. The experience thrilled him, and he wondered if he could also receive revelation and the gift to translate. His first try, though, didn’t go well.\nIf you’ve ever struggled to receive or understand revelation, maybe you can relate to Oliver’s experience—and learn from it. As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 6\n,\n8\n, and\n9\n, notice what the Lord taught Oliver about personal revelation. For example:\nWhat do\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:5–7\n;\n8:1\n;\n9:7–8\nsuggest about what the Lord requires of you before He will reveal His will?\nWhat do you learn from\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:14–17, 22–24\n;\n8:2–3\n;\n9:7–9\nabout the different ways revelation might come? How can you recognize it?\nWhat else do you learn about revelation from these sections?\nOliver’s experiences might cause you to “cast your mind” on moments when you’ve felt that the Lord was speaking to you (\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22\n). Have you ever recorded your thoughts or feelings about these experiences? If so, consider reading what you wrote. If not, take some time to write down what you remember. Consider how you can continue to draw strength from these experiences. For some ideas, see Elder Neil L. Andersen’s message “\nSpiritually Defining Memories\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 18–22).\nSeveral Church leaders have shared their experiences with revelation in the “\nHear Him\n” video collection. After watching one or more of these videos, you might feel inspired to record your own experiences, sharing how the Lord has spoken to you.\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nPersonal Revelation\n,” Gospel Library; “\nOliver Cowdery’s Gift\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 15–19.\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:18–21, 29–37\nLook unto Christ in every thought.\nThe Lord knew Joseph Smith would experience “difficult circumstances” in coming years (\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:18\n). He knows what trials are in your future too. What do you find in His counsel to Joseph and Oliver in\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:18–21, 29–37\nthat helps you trust Him?\nWhat do you feel it means to “look unto [Christ] in every thought”? (\nverse 36\n). How can you do this more consistently—during good times and “difficult circumstances”? Consider this counsel from President Russell M. Nelson: “It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him in\nevery\nthought. But when we do, our doubts and fears flee” (“\nDrawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 41).\nDoubt Not, Fear Not\nSee also Neil L. Andersen, “\nMy Mind Caught Hold upon This Thought of Jesus Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 91–94.\nDetail of\nBehold My Hand\n, by Jeffrey Ward\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:29–37\n“Fear not to do good.”\nWhy do we sometimes “fear … to do good”? (\nverse 33\n). What do you find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:29–37\nthat gives you courage to do good? Consider singing or listening to a hymn that inspires you to have courage in Christ, such as “\nLet Us All Press On\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 243).\nDoctrine and Covenants 6–7\n;\n9:3, 7–14\n“Even as you desire of me so it shall be.”\nNotice how many times words like “desire” or “desires” appear in\nsections 6 and 7\n. What do you learn from these sections about the importance God places on your desires? Ask yourself the Lord’s question in\nDoctrine and Covenants 7:1\n: “What desirest thou?”\nOne of Oliver Cowdery’s righteous desires—to translate as Joseph Smith did—was not fulfilled. As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 9:3, 7–14\n, what impressions do you receive that might help you when your righteous desires go unfulfilled for now?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 11:8\n; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nDesire\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2011, 42–45.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Oliver Cowdery\nJoseph and Emma Smith Home, Harmony, Pennsylvania\nBook of Mormon Translation\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:5, 15–16, 22–23\n;\n8:2\n;\n9:7–9\nHeavenly Father speaks to me through the Holy Ghost.\nThe truths Oliver Cowdery learned about personal revelation can help your children as they develop their ability to recognize the Holy Ghost. You could use “\nChapter 5: Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery\n” (in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 22–25, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library) to teach them about Oliver and what he learned. Share with each other your favorite parts of the story. As you do, emphasize things the Lord taught Oliver about how to hear God’s voice, and read relevant verses, such as\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:23\nor\n9:7–9\n.\nRecognizing Revelation\nThe Lord Sends Oliver Cowdery: Learning about how God speaks to us\nOliver Cowdery learned about revelation while helping Joseph Smith translate the Book of Mormon.\nYou could also invite your children to touch their heads and their chests as you read the words “mind” and “heart” in\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2\n. Tell your children, from your experiences, what it’s like when the Holy Ghost speaks to your mind and heart. Help them find answers to the question “How does the Holy Ghost speak to us?” in these verses:\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:15–16, 22–23\n;\n8:2\n;\n9:7–9\n.\nUse stories.\nStories help children understand gospel principles because they demonstrate how other people live these principles. As you teach, find ways to include stories—from the scriptures, from Church history, or from your own life—that illustrate the principles in the scriptures.\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:34\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I can “fear not.”\nThe Lord told Joseph and Oliver, “Fear not, little flock” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:34\n). You might invite your children to repeat that phrase with you several times. They might also enjoy pretending to be a flock of frightened sheep. What might sheep be afraid of? Then you and your children could look at a picture of the Savior as a shepherd (there’s one at the end of this outline) and talk about how He watches over us like a shepherd watches over His sheep.\nConsider playing or singing a song about finding courage in Christ, such as “\nDare to Do Right\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 158) or “\nLet Us All Press On\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 243). What does the song teach about how the Savior helps us not be afraid?\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:36\nI can look to Jesus Christ in every thought.\nAfter reading together\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:36\n, you and your children could make drawings to help you remember to “look unto [Jesus Christ] in every thought.” Share with each other your drawings, and help your children think of places they could put them so they will see them often.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe Lord Is My Shepherd\n, by Yongsung Kim"

It might make sense to retranslate that portion, but the Lord saw something they could not: their enemies were planning to alter the words on those pages to cast doubt on Joseph’s inspired work. God had a plan to avoid that problem and keep the work moving forward. Thousands of years earlier, God inspired Nephi to write a second record that covered the same time period “for a wise purpose in Him” (\n1 Nephi 9:5\n).\n“My wisdom,” the Lord said to Joseph, “is greater than the cunning of the devil” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 10:43\n). That’s a reassuring message in a day like ours, when the adversary is intensifying his efforts to weaken faith. Like Joseph, we can be “faithful and continue on” in the work God has called us to do (\nverse 3\n).

The Lord often chooses humble places for the most significant events in His kingdom. In a wooded area near Harmony on May 15, 1829, John the Baptist appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He placed his hands on their heads and conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon them, calling them “my fellow servants” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 13:1\n).\nJohn the Baptist was the trusted servant of God who baptized the Savior and prepared the way for His coming (see\nMatthew 3:1–6, 13–17\n). To these two young men in their twenties, it must have been humbling, perhaps even overwhelming, to be called John’s fellow servants. At the time, Joseph and Oliver were relatively unknown, much as Harmony was. But service in God’s work has always been about\nhow\nwe serve, not about who notices. However small or unseen your contribution may seem at times, you too are a fellow servant in the Lord’s “great and marvelous work” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 14:1\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 12\n;\n14\nI can participate in God’s “great and marvelous work.”\nJoseph Knight and David Whitmer both wanted to know how they could help in the work of the Lord. As you read the Lord’s answer to them (\nDoctrine and Covenants 12\n;\n14\n), think about what it means to you “to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion” (\n12:6\n; see also\n14:6\n). What principles and Christlike attributes do you find in these sections that can help you do this?\nSee also “\nThe Knight and Whitmer Families\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 20–24.\nDoctrine and Covenants 13\nJesus Christ sent John the Baptist to restore the Aaronic Priesthood.\nJohn the Baptist called Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery his “fellow servants.” What do you think it means to be a fellow servant with John the Baptist? (see\nMatthew 3:13–17\n;\nLuke 1:13–17\n;\n3:2–20\n).\nAs you read what John the Baptist said about the Aaronic Priesthood in\nsection 13\n, ponder how the keys of this priesthood help accomplish John’s mission to prepare the way of the Lord. For example:\nWhat is “the ministering of angels”? (see\n2 Nephi 32:2–3\n;\nMoroni 7:29–32\n; Guide to the Scriptures, “\nAngels\n,” Gospel Library).\nWhat is “the gospel of repentance”?

Renlund and his wife, Ruth, offered this explanation about priesthood keys:\n“The term priesthood\nkeys\nis used in two different ways. The first refers to a specific right or privilege conferred upon all who receive the Aaronic or Melchizedek Priesthood. … For instance, Aaronic Priesthood holders receive the keys of the ministering of angels and the keys of the preparatory gospel of repentance and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 13:1\n;\n84:26–27\n). Melchizedek Priesthood holders receive the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, the key of the knowledge of God, and the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the Church (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:19\n;\n107:18\n). …\n“The second way the term priesthood keys is used refers to leadership. Priesthood leaders receive additional priesthood keys, the right to preside over an organizational division of the Church or a quorum.

Joseph’s parents were visiting the Whitmers at the time. Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph’s mother, described the effect this miraculous experience had on the witnesses:",
        "“It was between three and four o’clock. Mrs. Whitmer and Mr. Smith and myself were sitting in a bedroom. I sat on the bedside. When Joseph came in, he threw himself down beside me. ‘Father! Mother!’ said he. ‘You do not know how happy I am. The Lord has caused the plates to be shown to three more besides me, who have also seen an angel and will have to testify to the truth of what I have said. For they know for themselves that I do not go about to deceive the people. And I do feel as though I was relieved of a dreadful burden, which was almost too much for me to endure. But they will now have to bear a part, and it does rejoice my soul that I am not any longer to be entirely alone in the world.’ Martin Harris then came in. He seemed almost overcome with excess of joy. He then testified to what he had seen and heard, as did also the others, Oliver and David. Their testimony was the same in substance as that contained in the Book of Mormon. …",
        "“Martin Harris particularly seemed altogether unable to give vent to his feelings in words. He said, ‘I have now seen an angel from Heaven who has of a surety testified of the truth of all that I have heard concerning the record, and my eyes have beheld him. I have also looked upon the plates and handled them with my hands and can testify of the same to the whole world. But I have received for myself a witness that words cannot express, that no tongue can describe, and I bless God in the sincerity of my soul that he has condescended to make me, even me, a witness of the greatness of his work and designs in behalf [of] the children of men.’ Oliver and David also joined with him in solemn praises to God for his goodness and mercy. We returned home [to Palmyra, New York,] the next day a cheerful, rejoicing little company.”",

That evening we held a meeting, in which all the witnesses bore testimony to the facts as stated above; and all of our family, even to Don Carlos [Smith], who was but 14 years of age, testified of the truth of the latter day dispensation—that it was then fully ushered in.”",

The angel Moroni showed them to her as an acknowledgment of the sacrifices she made while Joseph, Emma, and Oliver were living in her home. “You have been very faithful and diligent in your labors,” Moroni told her. “It is proper, therefore, that you should receive a witness that your faith may be strengthened.”"

      "plain_text": "“February 24–March 2, ‘The Worth of Souls Is Great’: Doctrine and Covenants 18,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Doctrine and Covenants 2025\n(2025)\n“Doctrine and Covenants 18,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2025\nFebruary 24–March 2: “The Worth of Souls Is Great”\nDoctrine and Covenants 18\nThere are many different ways to try to measure a person’s worth. Talent, education, wealth, and physical appearance can all affect how we evaluate each other—and ourselves. But in God’s eyes, our worth is a much simpler matter, and it is stated clearly in\nDoctrine and Covenants 18\n: “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God” (\nverse 10\n). This simple truth explains so much of what God does and why He does it. Why did He instruct Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to establish the Church of Jesus Christ in our day? (see\nverses 1–5\n). Because the worth of souls is great. Why does He “command all men everywhere to repent” and send Apostles to preach repentance? (\nverse 9\n). Because the worth of souls is great. And why did Jesus Christ suffer “death in the flesh” and “the pain of all men”? (\nverse 11\n). Because the worth of souls is great. If even one of these souls chooses to accept the Savior’s gift, He rejoices, for “great is his joy in the soul that repenteth” (\nverse 13\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:1–5\n“Build up my church.”\nIn\nsection 18\n, the Lord gave Oliver Cowdery instructions to help lay the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ. What do you notice about the counsel He gave—especially in\nverses 1–5\n? You might consider how this same counsel applies to you as you “build up” your faith in Christ. For example:\nWhat have you “desired to know” of the Lord? (\nverse 1\n).\nWhat does it mean to you to “rely upon the things which are written”? (\nverse 3\n). How has the Spirit “manifested unto you” that these things are true? (\nverse 2\n; see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–24\n).\nHow do you build your life on “the foundation of [the Savior’s] gospel and [His] rock”? (\nverse 5\n).\nAsk questions.\nThe Doctrine and Covenants is evidence that questions lead to revelation. As you study the scriptures, record questions that you have. Then ponder and pray to seek answers.\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:10–13\n“The worth of souls is great in the sight of God.”\nHow do we determine the worth of something? For example, why is one item at a market more expensive than another? As you read\nsection 18\nthis week, especially\nverses 10–13\n, you might contrast how people often determine value with what makes a soul valuable in God’s eyes. Consider substituting your name in place of the words “soul,” “souls,” and “all men.” How could these verses help someone who questions his or her worth?\nHere are some other passages that teach about the worth of a soul:\nLuke 15:1–10\n;\nJohn 3:16–17\n;\n2 Nephi 26:24–28\n;\nMoses 1:39\n. Based on these passages, how would you summarize the way God feels about you? You might also search President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “\nYou Matter to Him\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2011, 19–22) to find words and phrases that help you know about your worth to God.\nHow does God show you that you are of great worth to Him? How does this affect the way you feel about yourself and others?\nSee also Joy D. Jones, “\nValue beyond Measure\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 13–15; Topics and Questions, “\nChildren of God\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:11–16\nThe Lord rejoices when I repent.\nNotice how often words like\nrepent\nand\nrepentance\nare used throughout\nDoctrine and Covenants 18\n. Ponder what you learn from these words each time they are used. Consider especially\nverses 11–16\n. How do these verses affect how you feel about repentance—your own repentance and the duty to invite other people to repent and improve? Here’s one way to record what you learn: list several ways you would complete the sentence “Repentance is\n.”\nSee also\nAlma 36:18–21\n; Guide to the Scriptures, “\nRepentance\n,” Gospel Library; Dale G. Renlund, “\nRepentance: A Joyful Choice\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 121–24.\nDetail from\nThe Prodigal Son\n, by Clark Kelley Price\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:14–16\nJoy comes from helping others come unto Christ.\nAs you read\nverses 14–16\n, ponder what it means to “cry repentance”—and why it brings such joy. What are some ways you’ve found to help others come unto the Savior and receive forgiveness? How have other people done that for you?\nSee also Craig C. Christensen, “\nThere Can Be Nothing So Exquisite and Sweet as Was My Joy\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 45–47.\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:34–36\nI can hear the Lord’s voice in the scriptures.\nIf someone asked you what the voice of the Lord is like, what would you say? Think about this question as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:34–36\n. What have you learned about the voice of the Lord from reading Doctrine and Covenants? What can you do to hear His voice more clearly?\nSee also “\nAs I Search the Holy Scriptures\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 277.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Oliver Cowdery\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: David Whitmer\nWhitmer Farm: Church Organization Site\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:10–13\nEach of us is of great worth to God.\nAs you and your children read\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:10–13\n, consider substituting each other’s names in place of the words “soul,” “souls,” and “all men.” You could then talk about how these verses help us understand how Heavenly Father feels about each of us.\nYou could also ask your children about things that people consider valuable.

But in 1829 it became clear that the Book of Mormon could be published only if Martin mortgaged his farm to pay the printer. Martin had a testimony of the Book of Mormon, but Lucy did not. If Martin went forward with the mortgage and the Book of Mormon did not sell well, he would lose his farm, put his marriage at risk, and damage his reputation in the community. Although our circumstances are different from Martin’s, at some time or another we all face difficult questions like those he faced: What is the gospel of Jesus Christ worth to me? What am I willing to sacrifice to help build God’s kingdom? Martin Harris ultimately decided that he would mortgage his farm so the first 5,000 copies of the Book of Mormon could be printed. But even this sacrifice—and any sacrifice we might make—is small compared to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, “the greatest of all” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:18\n), who bled from every pore to save the repentant.\nFor more information about the publication of the Book of Mormon, see\nSaints\n,\n1:76–84\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:1–12\n“I, God, am endless.”\nJoseph Smith explained that the revelation in\nsection 19\nis “a commandment … to Martin Harris, given by him who is Eternal” (\nsection heading\n). Look for places in\nverses 1–12\nwhere the Lord emphasizes His eternal nature. Why do you think it was important for Martin Harris to know this about the Lord? Why is it important for you to know it?\nWhy do you think Jesus Christ is called “the beginning and the end”? (\nverse 1\n).\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:15–20\nJesus Christ suffered so that I can repent and come unto Him.\nThe New Testament describes the Savior’s suffering in Gethsemane from the perspective of the people who observed it. In\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:15–20\n, Jesus Christ told about His suffering from His own perspective. As you read this sacred personal account, look for how the Savior described His suffering. Consider what each word or phrase teaches you. Why was the Savior willing to suffer? You can discover more in\nJohn 15:13\n;\nMosiah 3:7\n;\nAlma 7:11–12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:10–13\n.\nThe feelings you have as you study the Savior’s suffering might prompt questions like these: Why did the Savior have to suffer for my sins? Why do I need to repent to receive the full blessings of His sacrifice? You might find insights about these questions and others in Elder Ulisses Soares’s message “\nJesus Christ: The Caregiver of Our Soul\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 82–84). As you study, what impressions come to your mind? Consider recording your feelings about Jesus Christ and His sacrifice for you.\nAs part of your study and worship, you might look for a hymn that you can listen to or sing that expresses your gratitude to the Savior for His suffering on your behalf. “\nI Stand All Amazed\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 193) is a good example.\nWhat do you feel Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ would have you do as a result of what you have felt and studied?\nSee also “\nJesus Christ will help you\n,”\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n(2022), 6–9; Topics and Questions, “\nAtonement of Jesus Christ\n,” “\nRepentance\n,” Gospel Library; D. Todd Christofferson, “\nThe Divine Gift of Repentance\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2011, 38–41; “Jesus Suffers in Gethsemane” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Savior Suffers in Gethsemane\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:23\nPeace comes from learning of Jesus Christ and following Him.\nConsider the Savior’s invitation: “Learn of me.” What do you learn about Jesus Christ in\nDoctrine and Covenants 19\n? Record your thoughts, and ponder how these truths about the Savior help you find peace. What does it mean to you to “walk in the meekness of [His] Spirit”?\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “\nFinding Personal Peace\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 29–31; “Peace in Christ” (video), Gospel Library.\nPeace in Christ\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:26–41\nGod’s blessings are greater than the treasures of the earth.\nThe Book of Mormon did not sell very well in Palmyra. As a result, Martin Harris ended up having to sell a large portion of his farm to pay the debt to the printer (see “\nThe Contributions of Martin Harris\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 7–8). Ponder Martin’s sacrifice—and the blessings you’ve received because of it—as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:26–41\n. You might also think about what the Lord has asked you to sacrifice. What do you find in these verses that inspires you to make these sacrifices with “rejoicing” and “gladness”? (see also\nverses 15–20\n).\nDetail from\nMartin Harris Farm\n, by Al Rounds\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Martin Harris\nMartin Harris Farm\nGrandin Building: Book of Mormon Publication Site\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–19\nJesus Christ suffered for me.\nYou can help your children feel reverence and gratitude for the Savior by reading together\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–19\nor “\nChapter 51: Jesus Suffers in the Garden of Gethsemane\n,” in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 129–32, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library.

But His work of Restoration had just started. In addition to restoring doctrine and priesthood authority, the Lord had made it clear through earlier revelations that He also wanted to restore a formal organization—His Church (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 10:53\n;\n18:5\n). On April 6, 1830, more than 40 believers crowded into the Whitmer family’s log home in Fayette, New York, to witness the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ.\nSome people wonder why an organized Church is necessary. The answer may be found, at least in part, in the revelations connected with that first Church meeting in 1830. They describe blessings that would not have been possible if the true Church of Jesus Christ had not been “regularly organized and established” in the latter days (\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:1\n).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:84–86\n; “\nBuild Up My Church\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 29–32.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 20–21\nJesus Christ has restored His Church.\nWhy do we have an organized Church? Perhaps the best answer is “Because Jesus Christ organized one.” As you study\nDoctrine and Covenants 20–21\n, you might notice similarities between the Church He established anciently and the one He has restored today. Use the following verses to learn about the Savior’s Church in ancient times:\nMatthew 16:15–19\n;\nJohn 7:16–17\n;\nEphesians 2:19–22\n;\n3 Nephi 11:23–26\n;\nMoroni 4–5\n. Use these verses to learn about the restored Church:\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:17–25, 60, 72–79\n;\n21:1–2\n. You could record what you find in a table like this one:\nDoctrine\nOrdinances\nPriesthood authority\nProphets\nChrist’s ancient Church\nDoctrine\nOrdinances\nPriesthood authority\nProphets\nChrist’s restored Church\nDoctrine\nOrdinances\nPriesthood authority\nProphets\nWhat do you learn from this activity about why Jesus Christ established—and restored—His Church?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nThe Need for a Church\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 24–26.\nInvite sharing.\nWhen you invite people to share what they have been learning on their own, they will feel encouraged to continue with their personal study. What could you invite others to share?\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37, 75–79\n;\n22\nSacred ordinances help me become like the Savior.\nWhen the Church was organized, the Lord taught His Saints about sacred ordinances, including baptism and the sacrament. As you read about these ordinances, ponder how they help you feel connected to the Savior. For example, how do these ordinances help you maintain your “determination to serve [Jesus Christ] to the end”? (\nverse 37\n). You might also read the sacrament prayers (\nverses 77, 79\n) and imagine that you are hearing them for the first time. What insights do you receive?\nSee also D. Todd Christofferson, “\nWhy the Covenant Path\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 116–19.\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:38–60\nPriesthood service blesses Church members and their families.\nHave you ever thought about why it was important to the Savior to restore the priesthood in His Church? Reading what He asks priesthood holders to do in\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:38–60\nmight give you some insights. How has the Savior blessed you and your family through the work described in these verses?\nIn addition to those who are ordained to the priesthood, women who are set apart to serve in the Church also exercise God’s authority as they participate in His work. To learn how, see President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “\nThe Keys and Authority of the Priesthood\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2014, 49–52).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nJoseph Smith’s Teachings about Priesthood, Temple, and Women\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 21\nObeying God’s word through His prophets will give me divine protection.\nDoctrine and Covenants 21:4–9\ncontains invitations to follow the Lord’s prophet and powerful promises for people who do. The following ideas can help you ponder these verses:\nWhat words in\nverses 4–5\ndescribe what the Savior wants you to do with the words of His living prophet? Why do you feel “patience and faith” are needed to do this?\nPonder the imagery the Savior uses in\nverse 6\nto describe the blessings of following His prophet. What do think is meant by “the gates of hell”? How does the Lord “disperse the powers of darkness” for you? What does it mean for “the heavens to shake for your good”?\nWhat is the Lord asking you to do through the current President of the Church? How has the Lord fulfilled His promises as you have followed His counsel?\nIn All Patience and Faith\nList additional insights you gain from the following sections of Elder Neil L. Andersen’s message “\nThe Prophet of God\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 24–27):\nWhy We Follow the Prophet:\nA Watchman on the Tower:\nDon’t Be Surprised:\nSee also “Watchman on the Tower” (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org; Topics and Questions, “\nProphets\n,” Gospel Library; “\nWe Listen to a Prophet’s Voice\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 22.\nWatchman on the Tower\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Peter Whitmer Sr.\nWhitmer Farm: Church Organization Site\nFounding Meeting of the Church of Christ\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 20–21\nThe Church of Jesus Christ has been restored.\nConsider using the section heading for\nDoctrine and Covenants 21\n,\nchapter 9\nof\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, or the video “Organization of the Church” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n) to help your children understand what happened on the day the Church was organized.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ Is Organized: A joyful Church meeting\nPerhaps your children could match pictures of Jesus Christ, someone ministering, a baptism, and the sacrament with verses in\nsection 20\n(see\nverses 21–23\n,\n47\n,\n72–74\n,\n75–79\n).

The baptism of Emma Smith and others, however, was disrupted by a mob who mocked them, threatened them, and forced them to flee. Later, just as Joseph was about to confirm the new members, he was arrested for upsetting the community with his preaching. In all this opposition, how could Emma find reassurance that she was doing the right thing? The same place we can all find it—through revelation from the Lord. He spoke to Emma about “the things of a better [world]”—His kingdom—and her place in it. He told her not to fear, to “lift up [her] heart and rejoice,” and to “cleave unto the covenants [she had] made.” And these words of encouragement and counsel are His “voice unto all” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:9–10, 13, 16\n).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:89–90\n,\n94–97\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 24\nThe Savior can lift me “up out of [my] afflictions.”\nThe revelation in\nDoctrine and Covenants 24\nwas given to “strengthen, encourage, and instruct” Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery during a time of trial (\nsection heading\n; see also\nSaints\n,\n1:94–96\n). Look for words in\nDoctrine and Covenants 24\nthat you feel would have been strengthening and encouraging to them.\nWhat do the following scriptures suggest to you about how the Savior helps you with your challenges?\nDoctrine and Covenants 24:1–3\nDoctrine and Covenants 24:8\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:7–8\nIsaiah 40:28–31\nMosiah 24:14–15\nDetail from\nHe Healed Many of Diverse Diseases\n, by J. Kirk Richards\nDoctrine and Covenants 25\nI have an important role to play in God’s kingdom.\nAs Emma Smith watched the Restoration unfold through her husband, Joseph Smith, she might have wondered what her role might be.

But what was Emma like? What do we know about her personality, her relationships, her strengths? One way to get to know this “elect lady” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:3\n) is to read the words of people who knew her personally.\nJoseph Smith Jr., her husband\n“With what unspeakable delight, and what transports of joy swelled my bosom, when I took by the hand, on that night, my beloved Emma—she that was my wife, even the wife of my youth; and the choice of my heart. Many were the re-vibrations of my mind when I contemplated for a moment the many scenes we had been called to pass through. The fatigues, and the toils, the sorrows, and sufferings, and the joys and consolations from time to time had strewed our paths and crowned our board. Oh! what a co-mingling of thought filled my mind for the moment. Again she is here, even in the seventh trouble, undaunted, firm, and unwavering, unchangeable, affectionate Emma.”\nLucy Mack Smith, her mother-in-law\n“She was then young, and, being naturally ambitious, her whole heart was in the work of the Lord, and she felt no interest except for the church and the cause of truth.

Early Church members knew that the Prophet Joseph Smith could receive revelation for the Church. But could others? Questions like this became critical when Hiram Page, one of the Eight Witnesses of the gold plates, believed he had received revelations for the Church. Many faithful Saints believed that these revelations were from God. The Lord responded by teaching that in His Church “all things must be done in order” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 28:13\n). This meant having only one person “appointed to receive commandments and revelations” for the entire Church (\nDoctrine and Covenants 28:2\n). Others, however, could receive personal revelation for their part in the Lord’s work. In fact, the Lord’s words to Oliver Cowdery are a reminder to all of us: “It shall be given thee … what thou shalt do” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 28:15\n).\nSee also “\nAll Things Must Be Done in Order\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 50–53.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:1–4\nI take the sacrament in remembrance of Jesus Christ.\nSally Knight and Emma Smith were baptized in June 1830, but their confirmations were disrupted by a mob. Two months later, Sally and her husband, Newel, visited Emma and Joseph, and it was decided that they would now be confirmed and that the group would partake of the sacrament together. While on his way to obtain wine for the sacrament, Joseph was stopped by an angel.\nRead\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:1–4\nto find out what the angel taught him about the sacrament. What do these verses suggest about how the Savior wants you to approach the sacrament? What do you think it means to partake of it “with an eye single to [His] glory”? Ponder this—and look for other insights about the sacrament—as you read\nLuke 22:19–20\nand\n3 Nephi 18:1–11\n. (See also the videos “The Last Supper,” “Jesus Christ Blesses Bread in Remembrance of Him,” and “Jesus Christ Blesses Wine in Remembrance of Him,” Gospel Library).\nThe Last Supper\nJesus Christ Blesses Bread in Remembrance of Him | 3 Nephi 18:1-7\nJesus Christ Blesses Wine in Remembrance of Him | 3 Nephi 18:8-11\nTo learn about making the sacrament a worshipful experience, consider studying Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nThe Living Bread Which Came Down from Heaven\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 36–39). What did Elder Christofferson teach that can help you feel a greater connection to the Savior through the sacrament? Ponder what you can do to better prepare to partake of the emblems of the Savior’s Atonement and treat them with greater reverence or purpose.\nConsider singing, listening to, or reading a sacrament hymn, like “\nAs Now We Take the Sacrament\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 169), and recording your feelings about participating in this sacred ordinance.\nUse music.\nSacred music invites the Spirit to testify of gospel truths. It can help you understand and feel these truths in a memorable way. Music also helps make learning more engaging.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n;\n59:9–13\n; Topics and Questions, “\nSacrament\n,” Gospel Library; “\nObtaining and Retaining a Remission of Sins through Ordinances\n,” in David A. Bednar, “\nAlways Retain a Remission of Your Sins\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 60–62.\nAlways Retain a Remission of Your Sins\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:5–14\nThe Lord gives His servants priesthood keys to direct His work.\nWhat do you know about the prophets mentioned in these verses? You could search for information about them in the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n. What blessings have been unlocked for you through the keys that these prophets held?\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:15–18\nThe armor of God helps me stand against evil.\nPresident M. Russell Ballard said: “There is not one great and grand thing we can do to arm ourselves spiritually. True spiritual power lies in numerous smaller acts woven together in a fabric of spiritual fortification that protects and shields from all evil” (“\nBe Strong in the Lord\n,”\nEnsign\n, July 2004, 8).\nAs you learn about the armor of God in\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:15–18\n, you could create a table like this one. What are you doing to put on each piece of the armor of God?\nPiece of armor\nPart of body protected\nWhat that body part may represent\nPiece of armor\nBreastplate of righteousness\nPart of body protected\nHeart\nWhat that body part may represent\nMy desires and affections\nPiece of armor\nHelmet of salvation\nPart of body protected\nHead or mind\nWhat that body part may represent\nPiece of armor\nPart of body protected\nWhat that body part may represent\nPiece of armor\nPart of body protected\nWhat that body part may represent\nSee also\nEphesians 6:11–18\n; Jorge F. Zeballos, “\nBuilding a Life Resistant to the Adversary\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 50–52.\nDoctrine and Covenants 28\nJesus Christ directs His Church through His living prophet.\nImagine what it would be like if anyone could receive commandments and revelation for the entire Church. When Hiram Page claimed to have received such revelation, many Church members were confused. In\nDoctrine and Covenants 28\n, the Lord revealed an order for revelation in His Church. What do you learn from this section about the specific role of the President of the Church? What do you learn about how God can direct you?\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nA Framework for Personal Revelation\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 16–19.\nDoctrine and Covenants 28:8–9\nWhy was a mission to the Lamanites significant?\nOne purpose of the Book of Mormon is “that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the promises of the Lord” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:20\n). This was consistent with promises the Lord made to many Book of Mormon prophets (see, for example,\n1 Nephi 13:34–41\n;\nEnos 1:11–18\n;\nHelaman 15:12–13\n). Early Church members considered the American Indians to be descendants of the Book of Mormon people. (The official position of the Church today is that the Lamanites “are among the ancestors of the American Indians” [\nintroduction to the Book of Mormon\n].)\nTo read more about Oliver Cowdery’s mission to nearby American Indians, see, “\nA Mission to the Lamanites\n,”\nRevelations in Context\n, 45–49. What does this mission teach you about the Lord and His work?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Hiram Page\nSeer Stones\nSacrament Meetings\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:1–2\nThe sacrament helps me remember Jesus Christ.\nChildren might wonder why we use water for the sacrament when Jesus used wine (see\nLuke 22:19–20\n;\n3 Nephi 18:1–11\n). You could read\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:1–2\ntogether and discuss what it means to take the sacrament “with an eye single to [God’s] glory” (\nverse 2\n). What can we do to focus on the Savior while we take the sacrament?\nPerhaps having pictures, scripture verses, or song lyrics about the Savior could help your children remember Him when taking the sacrament.

They had read prophecies in the Book of Mormon about the gathering of Israel and the building up of Zion (see\n3 Nephi 21\n). How would that happen? The revelations Hiram Page claimed to receive speculated on that subject, which only increased members’ curiosity (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 28\n). Other people wondered about the Fall of Adam and Eve and spiritual death. The Lord welcomed these questions in 1830, and He welcomes our questions today. “Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith,” He told the Saints, “being united in prayer according to my command, ye shall receive” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:6\n). In fact, as the doctrinally rich revelation in\nDoctrine and Covenants 29\nshows, the Lord sometimes responds to our questions by giving us truth and knowledge far beyond what we ask.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 29\nHeavenly Father has a plan for the salvation of His children.\nDoctrine and Covenants 29\nteaches many truths about God’s plan for you. As you read, look for truths you learn about each of the following parts of His plan:\nPremortal life (see\nverses 36–37\n)\nCreation (see\nverses 31–33\n)\nThe Fall of Adam and Eve (see\nverses 40–41\n)\nMortal life (see\nverses 39\n,\n42–45\n)\nThe Atonement of Jesus Christ (see\nverses 1\n,\n42–43\n,\n46–50\n)\nThe Resurrection (see\nverses 13\n,\n26\n)\nThe Final Judgment (see\nverses 12–13\n,\n27–30\n)\nWhat insights did you gain? If it’s helpful to you, you could write them in the space provided with the images at the end of this outline. How do these truths influence your life?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nPlan of Salvation\n,” Gospel Library.\nDetail from\nCome Unto Me\n, by Jenedy Paige\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:1–28\nJesus Christ invites me to help gather His people before His Second Coming.\nJesus Christ speaks of gathering His people “as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:2\n). What does this comparison teach you about Jesus Christ? What additional thoughts or impressions come to you as you study the illustration of a hen and chicks in this outline? Think about how you have felt Jesus Christ gathering and protecting you.\nAs you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:1–11\n, look for insights about:\nWho will be gathered.\nWhat it means to “gather” to Christ.\nWhy we gather to Him.\nPonder why you want other people to gather to Jesus Christ.

Pratt had been a member of the Church for about a month when he was called “into the wilderness” to preach the gospel (\nDoctrine and Covenants 32:2\n). Thomas B. Marsh had been a member for even less time than that when he was told, “The hour of your mission is come” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 31:3\n). Orson Pratt, Edward Partridge, and many others had likewise barely been baptized when their mission calls came. Perhaps there’s a lesson in this pattern for us today: if you know enough to accept the restored gospel by baptism, you know enough to share it with others. Of course, we always want to increase our gospel knowledge, but God has never hesitated to call upon the “unlearned” to preach His gospel (\nDoctrine and Covenants 35:13\n). In fact, He invites all of us, “Open your mouth to declare my gospel” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 30:5\n). And we do that best not through our own wisdom and experience but “by the power of [the] Spirit” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 35:13\n).\nSee also “\nThe Faith and Fall of Thomas Marsh\n,” “\nEzra Thayer: From Skeptic to Believer\n,” “\nOrson Pratt’s Call to Serve\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 54–69.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 30–36\nI am called to be a witness of Jesus Christ.\nWhether or not you have a formal calling as a missionary, you can be a witness of Jesus Christ “at all times, and in all things, and in all places” (\nMosiah 18:9\n).

You could also look for principles that can help you share the gospel. What do you find that inspires you to “declare glad tidings of great joy”? (\nDoctrine and Covenants 31:3\n).\nElder Gary E.

      "intro": [
        "Even before the Church was organized in April 1830, the Lord declared, “The field is white already to harvest” ( Doctrine and Covenants 4:4 ). This statement proved true in the months that followed, as many seekers of truth were led by the Spirit of God to find the restored Church of Jesus Christ.",
        "Many of these early converts were instrumental in laying the foundation of the Restoration, and their stories of conversion are valuable to us today. The faith they showed is the same faith we need to become converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ.",
        "When Abigail Calkins Leonard was in her mid-thirties, she wanted to be forgiven of her sins. She occasionally read the Bible, and people from Christian churches visited her home, but she was confused about what made one church different from another. “One morning,” she said, “I took my Bible and went to the woods, when I fell upon my knees.” She prayed fervently to the Lord. “Immediately a vision passed before my eyes,” she said, “and the different sects passed one after another by me, and a voice called to me, saying: ‘These are built up for gain.’ Then, beyond, I could see a great light, and a voice from above called out: ‘I shall raise up a people, whom I shall delight to own and bless.’” A short while later, Abigail heard about the Book of Mormon. Even though she didn’t yet have a copy, she sought to “know the truth of this book, by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost,” and she “immediately felt its presence.” When she finally was able to read the Book of Mormon, she was “ready to receive it.” She and her husband, Lyman, were baptized in 1831.",
        "When Thomas B. Marsh was a young adult, he studied the Bible and joined a Christian church. But he was unsatisfied, finally withdrawing from all churches. “I had a measure of the spirit of prophecy,” he said, “and told [a religious leader] that I expected a new church would arise, which would have the truth in its purity.” Not long after this, Thomas had a spiritual prompting to leave his home in Boston, Massachusetts, and travel west. After spending three months in western New York without finding what he was looking for, he started for home. On the way, a woman asked Thomas if he had heard about “the Golden Book found by a youth named Joseph Smith.” Captivated by this thought, Thomas immediately traveled to Palmyra and met Martin Harris at the printing shop, just as the first 16 pages of the Book of Mormon were coming off the press. Thomas was allowed to take a copy of those 16 pages, and he brought them home to his wife, Elizabeth. “She was well pleased” with the book, he recalled, “believing it to be the work of God.” Thomas and Elizabeth later moved to New York with their children and were baptized. (For more information about Thomas B. Marsh, see Doctrine and Covenants 31 .)",
        "Like Thomas Marsh, Parley and Thankful Pratt responded to spiritual stirrings to leave their prosperous farm in Ohio with the intent to preach the gospel as they understood it from the Bible. As Parley told his brother, “The spirit of these things had wrought so powerfully on my mind of late that I could not rest.” When they reached eastern New York, Parley had a prompting to stay awhile in the area. Thankful, they decided, would continue on without him. “I have a work to do in this region of country,” Parley told her, “and what it is, or how long it will take to perform it, I know not; but I will come when it is performed.” It was there that Parley first heard of the Book of Mormon. “I felt a strange interest in the book,” he said. He requested a copy and read through the night. By morning, he knew the book was true, valuing it “more than all the riches of the world.” Within a few days Parley was baptized. He then returned to Thankful, who was also baptized. (For more information about Parley P. Pratt, see Doctrine and Covenants 32 .)",
        "On his way from New York to a mission in Missouri, Parley Pratt and his fellow laborers stopped in Mentor, Ohio, at the home of Sidney and Phebe Rigdon—old friends Parley knew from his days in Ohio. Sidney was a Christian minister, and Parley was once a member of his congregation and considered him a spiritual mentor. Parley eagerly told his friends about the Book of Mormon and the Restoration of Jesus Christ’s gospel. Sidney himself had been searching for a restoration of the true Church that he found described in the New Testament, though he was skeptical about the Book of Mormon at first. “But I will read your book,” he told his friend Parley, “and will endeavor to ascertain, whether it be a revelation from God or not.” After two weeks of study and prayer, both he and Phebe were convinced the book was true. But Sidney also knew that joining the Church would be a major sacrifice for his family. He would obviously lose his job as a minister, along with his social status in the community. As he and Phebe discussed this possibility, Phebe declared, “I have counted the cost, and … it is my desire to do the will of God, come life or come death.”"

She occasionally read the Bible, and people from Christian churches visited her home, but she was confused about what made one church different from another. “One morning,” she said, “I took my Bible and went to the woods, when I fell upon my knees.” She prayed fervently to the Lord. “Immediately a vision passed before my eyes,” she said, “and the different sects passed one after another by me, and a voice called to me, saying: ‘These are built up for gain.’ Then, beyond, I could see a great light, and a voice from above called out: ‘I shall raise up a people, whom I shall delight to own and bless.’” A short while later, Abigail heard about the Book of Mormon. Even though she didn’t yet have a copy, she sought to “know the truth of this book, by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost,” and she “immediately felt its presence.” When she finally was able to read the Book of Mormon, she was “ready to receive it.” She and her husband, Lyman, were baptized in 1831.",
            "When Thomas B. Marsh was a young adult, he studied the Bible and joined a Christian church. But he was unsatisfied, finally withdrawing from all churches. “I had a measure of the spirit of prophecy,” he said, “and told [a religious leader] that I expected a new church would arise, which would have the truth in its purity.” Not long after this, Thomas had a spiritual prompting to leave his home in Boston, Massachusetts, and travel west. After spending three months in western New York without finding what he was looking for, he started for home. On the way, a woman asked Thomas if he had heard about “the Golden Book found by a youth named Joseph Smith.” Captivated by this thought, Thomas immediately traveled to Palmyra and met Martin Harris at the printing shop, just as the first 16 pages of the Book of Mormon were coming off the press. Thomas was allowed to take a copy of those 16 pages, and he brought them home to his wife, Elizabeth. “She was well pleased” with the book, he recalled, “believing it to be the work of God.” Thomas and Elizabeth later moved to New York with their children and were baptized.

Thankful, they decided, would continue on without him. “I have a work to do in this region of country,” Parley told her, “and what it is, or how long it will take to perform it, I know not; but I will come when it is performed.” It was there that Parley first heard of the Book of Mormon. “I felt a strange interest in the book,” he said. He requested a copy and read through the night. By morning, he knew the book was true, valuing it “more than all the riches of the world.” Within a few days Parley was baptized.

      "plain_text": "“April 14–20: ‘I Am He Who Liveth, I Am He Who Was Slain’: Easter,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Doctrine and Covenants 2025\n(2025)\n“Easter,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2025\nApril 14–20: “I Am He Who Liveth, I Am He Who Was Slain”\nEaster\nApril 3, 1836, was Easter Sunday. After helping administer the sacrament to Saints in the newly dedicated Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery found a quiet place behind a veil and bowed in silent prayer. Then, on this sacred day when Christians everywhere were commemorating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the risen Savior Himself appeared in His temple, declaring, “I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:4\n).\nWhat does it mean to say that Jesus Christ is “he who liveth”? It doesn’t just mean that He rose from the tomb and appeared to His disciples in Galilee. It means that He lives today. He speaks through prophets today. He leads His Church today. He heals wounded souls and broken hearts today. So we can echo the words of Joseph Smith’s powerful testimony: “After the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony … which we give of him: That he lives!” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:22\n). We can hear His voice in these revelations, witness His hand in our lives, and feel “the joy this sentence gives: ‘I know that my Redeemer lives!’” (\nHymns\n,\nno. 136\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJesus Christ lives.\nMost of us have not seen Jesus Christ as the Prophet Joseph Smith did. But we can know, as he did, that the Savior lives, that He knows our successes and struggles, and that He will help us in times of need. Consider your own testimony of the living Christ as you ponder the questions below and study the accompanying resources.\nWho is Jesus Christ? Why do we worship Him? (see “\nThe Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles\n”).\nWhat does the Spirit teach me about the experiences of Joseph Smith and others who saw the Savior? How do their testimonies strengthen mine? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:11–14\n,\n20–24\n;\n110:1–10\n;\nJoseph Smith—History:17\n).\nWhat do I learn about the Savior’s mission and divinity from His own words? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:5\n;\n38:7\n).\nHow can the Savior help me today? (see\nIsaiah 53:3–5\n;\nHebrews 2:17–18\n;\nMosiah 3:7\n;\nAlma 7:11–13\n;\n36:3\n;\nEther 12:27\n;\nMoses 5:10–12\n).\nPower comes from memorization.\nElder Richard G. Scott explained: “Great power can come from memorizing scriptures. To memorize a scripture is to forge a new friendship. It is like discovering a new individual who can help in time of need, give inspiration and comfort, and be a source of motivation for needed change” (“\nThe Power of Scripture\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 2011, 6). If you find a scripture about the Savior that’s especially meaningful to you—perhaps one that could give you comfort in a time of need—consider memorizing it.\nIn the video “My Spiritual Goal,” a young woman decides to memorize “\nThe Living Christ\n” (Gospel Library). What impresses you about her experience? What do you feel inspired to do to receive the truths in “The Living Christ” in your heart and mind?\nLet Your Goals Be Guided by the Spirit\nTo learn more about how the Savior blesses us today, you could study, listen to, or sing “\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 136). It could be inspiring to look for truths in this hymn that are also taught in\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:34\n;\n84:77\n;\n98:18\n;\n138:23\n.\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nJesus Christ\n,” Gospel Library.\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I will be resurrected.\nJoseph Smith knew how it feels to mourn the death of loved ones, including his father and two of his brothers. Joseph and Emma buried six of their children, each younger than two years old. From the revelations God gave, Joseph and Emma gained an eternal perspective.\nLook for truths about death and God’s eternal plan in\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:26–27\n;\n42:45–46\n;\n63:49\n;\n88:14–17, 27–31\n;\n93:33–34\n. How do these truths affect the way you view death? How do they affect the way you live?\nSee also\n1 Corinthians 15\n;\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith\n(2007),\n174–76\n;\nEaster.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nJesus Christ accomplished a “perfect atonement” for me.\nOne way to focus on the Savior at Easter time is to study revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants that teach about His atoning sacrifice. Some can be found in\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:10–13\n;\n19:16–19\n;\n45:3–5\n;\n76:69–70\n. Consider making a list of truths that you find in these verses. To deepen your study, you could add to your list by searching\nLuke 22:39–44\n;\n1 John 1:7\n;\n2 Nephi 2:6–9\n;\nMosiah 3:5–13, 17–18\n;\nMoroni 10:32–33\n.\nHere are some questions that could guide your study:\nWhat is the Atonement of Jesus Christ?\nWhy did Jesus Christ choose to suffer and die for us?\nWhat must I do to receive the blessings of His sacrifice?\nHow do I feel about Jesus Christ after reading these verses?\nSee also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nAtonement\n,” Gospel Library; “The Savior Suffers in Gethsemane” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Savior Suffers in Gethsemane\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I will be resurrected.\nTo teach your children about resurrection, you could start by showing them pictures of the death and Resurrection of the Savior. Let your children share what they know about these events. You could also sing a song like “\nDid Jesus Really Live Again?\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 64).\nConsider an object lesson that could help your children understand what happens when we die (our spirits and bodies separate) and when we are resurrected (our spirits and bodies come back together, and our bodies are perfect and immortal). For example, what happens when we remove the battery from a flashlight or the ink container from a pen? What happens when they are reunited? (See\nAlma 11:44–45\n.)\nDo your children know someone who has passed away? Let them share a little about these individuals, and then read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:17\n. Talk with each other about how it feels to know that our loved ones will be resurrected and have bodies again.\nIf you have older children, you might invite them to look for phrases that capture the message of Easter in the following passages:\nDoctrine and Covenants 63:49\n;\n88:14–17, 27\n;\n138:11, 14–17\n. They could do the same with the video “\nBecause He Lives\n” (Gospel Library). How can we share this message with others?\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith saw Jesus Christ.\nYou and your children might be interested to read about three different times Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph Smith and others, as recorded in\nJoseph Smith—History 1:14–17\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:11–24\n;\n110:1–10\n. Your children could also look at pictures of these events in this week’s\nactivity page\n. What do we learn about Jesus Christ from each of these experiences? Why is it a blessing to know that Joseph Smith and others saw the risen Savior?\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I can be forgiven of my sins.\nThe truths Joseph Smith learned about forgiveness through Christ can give your children hope that they can be forgiven of their mistakes and sins.

The revelations used words like\ncause\n,\nkingdom\n,\nZion\n, and, quite often,\nwork\n. That may have been part of what attracted people to the restored Church. As much as they loved the doctrine, many also wanted something holy they could dedicate their lives to. Even so, obeying the Lord’s 1830 command to gather in Ohio was not easy. For many, it meant leaving comfortable homes for an unfamiliar frontier (see “\nVoices of the Restoration: Gathering to Ohio\n”). Today we can see clearly what those Saints could see only with the eye of faith: the Lord had great blessings waiting for them in Ohio.\nThe need to gather to Ohio has long since passed, but Saints today still unite around the same cause: to “bring forth Zion” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 39:13\n). Like those early Saints, we are invited to forsake “the cares of the world” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 40:2\n) and trust the Lord’s promise: “You shall receive … a blessing so great as you never have known” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 39:10\n).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:109–11\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 37–38\nGod gathers us to bless us.\nMembers of the Church in Fayette, New York, had to make difficult sacrifices to move to Ohio (more than 250 miles away) in the winter of 1831. As you read about the Lord’s command in\nDoctrine and Covenants 37:3–4\n, you might think about sacrifices the Lord has asked of you. Then, as you study\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:1–33\n, look for truths about the Savior that give you faith to follow His counsel. What do you learn from\nverses 11–33\nabout the blessings of gathering as followers of Jesus Christ?\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:22\n“Hear my voice and follow me.”\nHow can you make Jesus Christ your “lawgiver”? How does following His laws make you “a free people”?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 2:26–27\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:30\nIf I am prepared, I don’t need to be afraid.\nWhen have you experienced the principle the Lord revealed in\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:30\n: “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear”? As you study\nsection 38\n, notice how the Lord prepares His Saints so they can face the future with courage. How does He want you to prepare for challenges so that you don’t need to be afraid?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nWe Will Prove Them Herewith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 8–11.\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:24–27\nGod wants us to “be one.”\nThe Saints who gathered in Ohio came from a variety of circumstances.

My mother told me she would rather see me buried than going thus alone out into the heartless world.\n“‘[Phebe],’ she said, impressively, ‘will you come back to me if you find Mormonism false?’\n“I answered, ‘yes, mother; I will.’ … My answer relieved her trouble; but it cost us all much sorrow to part. When the time came for my departure I dared not trust myself to say farewell; so I wrote my good-byes to each, and leaving them on my table, ran downstairs and jumped into the carriage. Thus I left the beloved home of my childhood to link my life with the saints of God.”\nIn one of those farewell messages, Phebe wrote:\n“Beloved Parents—I am now about to leave my paternal roof for a while … I know not how long—but not without grateful feelings for the kindness which I have received from my infancy until the present time—but Providence seems to order it otherwise now than it has been. Let us commit all these things into the hands of Providence and be thankful that we have been permitted to live together so long under so favorable circumstances as we have, believing that all things will work for our good if we love God supremely. Let us realize that we can pray to one God who will hear the sincere prayers of all his creatures and give us that which is best for us. …\n“Mother, I believe it is the will of God for me to go to the west and I have been convinced that it has been for a long time. Now the way has opened … ; I believe that it is the spirit of the Lord that has done it which is sufficient for all things. O be not anxious for your child; the Lord will comfort me. I believe that the Lord will take care of me and give me that which is for the best. … I go because my Master calls—he has made my duty plain.”\nNotes\nEdward W. Tullidge,\nThe Women of Mormondom\n(1877), 412.\nPhebe Carter letter to her parents, no date, Church History Library, Salt Lake City; punctuation modernized. Phebe joined the Church in 1834, moved to Ohio around 1835, and married Wilford Woodruff in 1837."

This growth was exciting and encouraging to the Saints, but it also presented some challenges. How do you unify a quickly expanding group of believers? Specifically, what do you do when they bring doctrine and practices from their previous faiths? For example, when Joseph Smith arrived in Kirtland in early February 1831, he found new members sharing common property in a genuine attempt to imitate the New Testament Christians (see\nActs 4:32–37\n). The Lord made some important corrections and clarifications on this and other topics. He did this largely through a revelation recorded in\nDoctrine and Covenants 42\nthat He called “my law to govern my church” (\nverse 59\n). In this revelation, we learn truths that are fundamental in establishing the Lord’s Church in the latter days. And we learn that we have a lot more to learn: “If thou shalt ask,” the Lord promised, “thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:61\n).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:114–19\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 41\n“He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple.”\nBy early 1831, the Saints were starting to gather in Ohio. They were eager to receive the law that God had promised to reveal there (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:32\n). But first, He taught how His disciples should prepare to receive His law. What principles do you find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 41:1–6\nthat would have helped the Saints receive God’s law? How might these principles help you receive instruction from Him?\nSee also “\nA Bishop unto the Church\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 77–83.\nDoctrine and Covenants 42\nThe Lord gives me commandments because He loves me.\nThe Saints considered the revelation found in\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:1–72\nto be one of the most important the Prophet had received. It was one of the first revelations to be published. For many years, the Saints called it simply “the law.” While the section does not include all the Lord’s commandments or laws, it is worth pondering why these principles were important for the newly restored Church. Why are they important for us today?\nBecause\nsection 42\nis relatively long, you might consider studying it in smaller portions, like the following. Identify the principles taught in each, and consider how these laws are a sign of the Lord’s love for His people.\nVerses 4–9, 11–17, 56–58\nVerses 18–29\nVerses 30–31\nVerses 40–42\nVerses 43–52\nWhy does God give us laws and commandments?

What do you learn from\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:30–42\nabout how the Saints lived the law of consecration?

Perhaps singing a song like “\nBecause I Have Been Given Much\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 219) can give you ideas.\nSee also Sharon Eubank, “\nI Pray He’ll Use Us\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 53–56; “\nThe Law\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 93–95.\nChrist and the Rich Young Ruler\n, by Heinrich Hofmann\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:61, 65–68\n;\n43:1–16\nGod gives revelation to guide His Church—and to guide me.\nImagine that you are having a conversation with a new member of the Church who is excited to know that the Church is guided by revelation. How could you use\nDoctrine and Covenants 43:1–16\nto help him or her learn about the Lord’s pattern for guiding His Church through His prophet? How could you use\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:61, 65–68\nto teach about receiving personal revelation?\nWhat are some of the “peaceable things” and joyful things you have received from the Lord through His Spirit?\nTo learn about how leaders of the Church have heard the Lord’s voice, you could watch one of the videos in the “\nHear Him\n” collection in the Gospel Library. Consider creating your own video, explaining how the Lord communicates with you.\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nRevelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 93–96; “\nAll Things Must Be Done in Order\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 50–53.\nUse object lessons.\nObject lessons or visual aids can help the people you teach understand gospel truths better and remember them longer. For example, you might use a puzzle, assembled piece by piece, to teach about receiving “revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:61\n).\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Edward Partridge\nHistoric Kirtland\nConsecration and Stewardship\nBishop\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 41:5\nA disciple is someone who receives God’s law and obeys it.\nTo help your children know what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, you can write\nDoctrine and Covenants 41:5\non a piece of paper, leaving blanks where the word\ndisciple\nshould be. They could then look in\nverse 5\nfor the missing word. According to this verse, what does it mean to be a disciple of Jesus Christ? How are we trying to be better disciples of Christ?\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:2\nI am happy when I obey the Lord.\nYour children might enjoy playing a game that requires them to listen carefully and follow instructions. You could use this game to talk about what it means to “hearken and hear and obey” the Lord (\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:2\n). What instructions has He given us? How are we blessed by obeying His laws and commandments?\nYou might complete this week’s\nactivity page\nwith your children. You could also sing a song about obeying God’s laws, such as “\nI Want to Live the Gospel\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 148). Consider sharing with each other how obeying God’s laws has brought you happiness.\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:38\nI am serving Jesus Christ when I serve others.\nAfter reading together\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:38\n, help your children think of ways they can serve Jesus by serving others. They can find some ideas from the video “Pass It On” (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). They could also look at pictures of the Savior helping others, healing the sick, or being kind to children (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 42\n,\n47\n).\nPass It On\nYou might show your children a Tithing and Other Offerings slip and talk about how to use it to give what we have to bless others (see also “\nTithing and Donations Online\n”).\nMiguel's Choice | Growing Faith | HDF\nDoctrine and Covenants 43:1–7\nOnly the prophet can receive revelation for the whole Church.\nInvite your children to imagine that someone stands up in testimony meeting and tells the ward that he has received a revelation for the whole Church (for example, a revelation that we should no longer eat carrots or that we should wash our hands with milk instead of water.) He says that we should listen to what he says instead of the prophet. What would be wrong with that? You could then study\nDoctrine and Covenants 43:1–7\ntogether to find out how the Lord gives commandments to His Church.\nYou could also show a picture of the living prophet and invite your children to share something he taught recently. If they need help, share a video clip or passage from a recent general conference message. Why is it a blessing to have a living prophet today?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nJoseph Smith Preaching\n, by Sam Lawlor\nOpen PDF"

In it the Savior gives His tender promise to plead for us before the Father (see\nverses 3–5\n). He tells of His everlasting covenant spreading throughout the world, like “a messenger … to prepare the way before [Him]” (\nverse 9\n). And He prophesies of His glorious Second Coming. The Savior does all of this while also acknowledging that these are troubling times (see\nverse 34\n), in part because of the perils that are to take place before His coming. But that peril, that darkness is not strong enough to extinguish the light of hope. “For verily I say unto you,” the Lord declared, “that I am … a light that shineth in darkness” (\nverse 7\n). That alone is reason to receive this revelation—with whatever counsel and warnings and truth He wants to give—with joy.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:1–5\nJesus Christ is my Advocate with the Father.\nWhen we feel inadequate or unworthy before God, we can find reassurance from the Savior’s words in\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:1–5\n. As you search these verses, consider questions like these:\nWhat words or phrases in these verses feel especially meaningful to you?\nAn advocate is someone who publicly supports or recommends a person or cause. According to these verses, how does Jesus Christ do this for you? What qualifies Him to do it?\nWhat impresses you about the Savior’s words to the Father? (\nverses 4–5\n).\nYou could also study what Elder Dale G. Renlund taught about Jesus Christ, our Advocate, in “\nChoose You This Day\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 104–5). According to Elder Renlund, how does the Savior’s purpose compare with Lucifer’s?\nThe following passages may add to your understanding of the Savior’s role as Advocate. As you study them, consider writing down phrases or truths you could share with others:\n2 Nephi 2:8–9\n;\nMosiah 15:7–9\n;\nMoroni 7:27–28\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:5\n;\n62:1\n. Why are these phrases meaningful to you?\nSee also “\nI Stand All Amazed\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 193; Topics and Questions, “\nAtonement of Jesus Christ\n,” Gospel Library; “The Mediator” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Mediator\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:9–10\nThe gospel is a standard to the nations.\nAnciently, a standard was a banner carried into battle used to rally and unify troops. A standard is also an example or rule that other things can be measured against. As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:9–10\n, ponder how your covenants with the Lord have been a standard for you.\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:11–75\nJesus Christ will return in glory.\nThe Second Coming of the Lord has been described as both “great” and “dreadful” (\nMalachi 4:5\n). In\nDoctrine and Covenants 45\n, both descriptions seem to fit. This revelation includes both sober warnings and hopeful promises about the Lord’s coming. As you study\nverses 11–75\n, ponder how you can prepare for the Second Coming with faith in Christ rather than fear. Record what you find in a table like this one:\nProphecy or promise\nWhat I can do\nProphecy or promise\nA light (the gospel) shall come to those who sit in darkness (\nverse 28\n)\nWhat I can do\nReceive the light—and share it (\nverse 29\n)\nProphecy or promise\nWhat I can do\nProphecy or promise\nWhat I can do\nProphecy or promise\nWhat I can do\nIn the video “Men’s Hearts Shall Fail Them” (Gospel Library), what counsel did President Russell M. Nelson give to help us face fearful situations with peace?\nMen's Hearts Shall Fail Them\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:31–32, 56–57\nI can “stand in holy places” and not be moved.\nWhat do you learn in\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:31–32, 56–57\nabout preparing for the Lord’s coming? What are your “holy places”? What does it mean to “not be moved”? How can you make where you are more holy?\nNote that the Lord referred to the parable of the ten virgins, comparing the oil in the parable to truth and the Holy Spirit. Consider reading the parable in\nMatthew 25:1–13\nwith that in mind. What insights do you gain?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nIf Ye Had Known Me\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 102–5.\nParable of the Ten Virgins\n, by Dan Burr\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:11–15, 66–71\nZion is a place of safety for the Saints of God.\nThe Saints in Joseph Smith’s time were eager to build Zion, the New Jerusalem (see\nEther 13:2–9\n;\nMoses 7:18, 62–64\n). What do you learn about Zion—both the ancient city of Enoch’s day and the latter-day city—from\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:11–15, 66–71\n? Today the command to establish Zion refers to establishing God’s kingdom wherever we live. What can you do to help build Zion wherever you live?\nPeople, Places, Events\nJoseph Smith Jr.\nIsaac and Lucy Morley Farm\nJoseph Smith Translation of the Bible\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:3–5\nJesus Christ is my Advocate with the Father.\nYou might want to help your children understand that an advocate is someone who supports another person. Then you could talk about examples of being an advocate that they may be familiar with (like standing up for a friend). As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:3–5\ntogether, help your children discover who our Advocate is and how He helps us.\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:32\nI can “stand in holy places.”\nIt might be fun to place pictures of a home, a Church building, and a temple around the room. Then you could give your children clues describing these places and invite them to stand near the picture you are describing. Ask them to stand still while you read the first line from\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:32\n. What are some holy places God gives us? Help your children understand that to “stand in holy places, and … not be moved” means to choose the right at all times, no matter what is happening. How can we make our home a more holy place?\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:9\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is a standard to the world.\nYou might explain to your children that anciently, a standard was a banner or flag carried into battle. It helped soldiers know where to gather and what to do. Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:9\n, and discuss ways the gospel is like a standard. Your children may enjoy making their own standard or flag, including images or words that express their feelings about the Savior.\nThe gospel is like a standard, or a banner or flag.\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:44–45\nJesus Christ will come again.\nThe destruction that will happen before the Second Coming may make children afraid. Pointing them to Jesus Christ can help them look forward with faith! Consider inviting them to think about how they feel when someone special is coming to visit, like a grandparent or friend. How do they prepare for the visit? Then you could show a picture of the Savior and read\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:44–45\n. Share with each other how you feel about the Savior’s coming.\nPersonal Preparation to Meet the Savior\nTo help your children feel excited about the Savior’s Second Coming, you could write on slips of paper some of the hopeful promises from\nsection 45\n(see, for example,\nverses 44–45, 51–52, 55, 58–59, 66–71\n). Give your children the papers and ask them to raise their hand when the promise they are holding is mentioned as you read the verses. Discuss what these promises mean. You could also sing with your children a song about the Savior’s Second Coming, such as “\nWhen He Comes Again\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 82–83).\nHelp children recognize the Spirit.\nAs you teach your children, tell them when you feel the Holy Ghost. Talk about how you recognize His influence. For example, you might feel peaceful or joyful while singing a song about the Savior.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe Second Coming\n, by Harry Anderson"

Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Ziba Peterson, and Peter Whitmer Jr. left Kirtland and moved on to continue preaching the gospel, they left more than 100 new members of the Church who had plenty of zeal but little experience or direction. They had no instructional handbooks, no leadership training meetings, no broadcasts of general conference—in fact, they didn’t even have enough copies of the Book of Mormon to go around. Many of these new believers had been drawn to the restored gospel by the promise of marvelous manifestations of the Spirit, especially those described in the New Testament (see, for example,\n1 Corinthians 12:1–11\n). But many found it hard to identify true manifestations of the Spirit. Seeing the confusion, Joseph Smith prayed for help. The Lord’s answer is valuable today, when people often deny or ignore the things of the Spirit. He reaffirmed that spiritual manifestations are real. He also clarified what they are: gifts from a loving Heavenly Father, “given for the benefit of those who love [Him] and keep all [His] commandments, and him that seeketh so to do” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:9\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:1–7\nThe Savior welcomes all who want to worship in His Church.\nDo you feel that your friends and people in your neighborhood feel welcome at your ward’s worship services? What are you doing to make your Church meetings places that people want to return to? Ponder how you can apply the Lord’s counsel in\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:1–7\n(see also\n2 Nephi 26:24–28\n;\n3 Nephi 18:22–23\n).\nYou might also think about a time when you attended Church services—or a meeting of another group—for the first time. What did people do to help you feel welcome?\nSee also\nMoroni 6:5–9\n; “\n’Tis Sweet to Sing the Matchless Love\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 177; “Welcome” (video), Gospel Library.\nWelcome Comeuntochrist.org\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:7–33\nHeavenly Father gives me spiritual gifts to bless others.\nThe early Saints believed in spiritual gifts but needed some help recognizing them and understanding their purpose. As you study about gifts of the Spirit in\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:7–33\n, ponder the purpose “for [which] they are given” (\nverse 8\n). What do you learn about God—the giver of these gifts?\nCan you think of examples you’ve seen of people using these or other spiritual gifts? How did they “benefit … the children of God”? (\nverse 26\n). You might also see if you can identify examples of different spiritual gifts in scriptures like these:\n1 Kings 3:5–15\n;\nDaniel 2:26–30\n;\nActs 3:1–8\n;\nHelaman 5:17–19\n;\nMormon 1:1–5\n;\nEther 3:1–15\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:10–12\n;\nMoses 7:13\n.\nYour study of spiritual gifts might lead you to ponder what gifts God has given you. How can you use these gifts to bless His children? If you have a patriarchal blessing, it likely identifies gifts you have been given. Reading Elder John C. Pingree Jr.’s message “\nI Have a Work for Thee\n” could also open your mind to gifts you haven’t thought of (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 32–35).\nIf you’d like to learn about how to develop spiritual gifts, the analogy at the beginning of Elder Juan Pablo Villar’s message “\nExercising Our Spiritual Muscles\n” could help (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 95). What “exercises” could help you develop your spiritual gifts?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nHoly Ghost\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 47\nThe Lord wants His Church to keep a history.\nJohn Whitmer’s calling to keep a history of the Church continued a long tradition of record keepers among God’s people. Why do you think keeping a history is so important to the Lord? Ponder this as you read section 47 as well as similar instructions in\n2 Nephi 29:11–12\n;\nMoses 6:5\n;\nAbraham 1:28, 31\n. What do you feel the Lord wants you to record about your life?\nOn FamilySearch, you can record memories and experiences from your life—and your ancestors’ lives (see\nFamilySearch.org\n).\nSee Henry B. Eyring, “\nO Remember, Remember\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2007, 66–69.\nJohn Whitmer\nDoctrine and Covenants 47\nThe Holy Ghost can direct me as I fulfill my calling.\nMaybe you can relate to what John Whitmer felt when he wanted reassurance that his calling came from God. What did the Lord say in\nDoctrine and Covenants 47\nto John Whitmer—and to you—to inspire confidence in fulfilling callings He gives?\nThe role of a teacher.\nTeaching is much more than presenting information. It includes creating an environment where class members can learn and discover truths for themselves and share what they have learned with each other (see\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n26\n).\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: John Whitmer\nThe Book of John Whitmer\nSacrament Meetings\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:2–6\nI can help others feel welcome at church.\nAfter reading\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:5\nwith your children, talk about how the Savior wants people to feel when they come to His Church. Invite your children to imagine that they saw someone at church for the first time. Help them practice ways to help this person feel welcome.\n“By This All Will Know That You Are My Disciples”\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:7–26\nHeavenly Father gives me spiritual gifts to bless others.\nTo help your children learn about the spiritual gifts described in\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:13–26\n, consider this idea. You could write the gifts on pieces of paper and hide them around the room. As your children find each paper, help them find where that gift is mentioned in\nsection 46\n. For each gift, talk with them about how it is used to bless others (the descriptions in “\nChapter 20: Gifts of the Spirit\n,” in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 77–80, can help).\nChapter 20: Gifts of the Spirit: 8•March 1831\nTell your children about the gifts you feel Heavenly Father has given them, and let them talk about the gifts they notice in each other. According to\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:8–9, 26\n, why does Heavenly Father give us spiritual gifts? How can we use our gifts to help others?\nDoctrine and Covenants 47:1, 3\nI can record my history.\nLet your children discover what the Lord wanted John Whitmer to do in\nDoctrine and Covenants 47:1, 3\n. You might also share with each other favorite stories from the scriptures. Point out that we know about these stories because someone recorded them.\nConsider how you might inspire your children to record their personal histories. You could share some entries from your personal journal or a story about an ancestor (see\nFamilySearch.org\nor the Memories app). You might provide some journal prompts, like “What happened this week that you would like your grandchildren to know about?” or “How did you see the Lord’s hand in your life this week?” Young children could draw pictures of their experiences, or you could record them telling their stories. What blessings come from keeping a “regular history”? (\nDoctrine and Covenants 47:1\n).\nDoctrine and Covenants 48:2–3\nI can help others by sharing what I have been given.\nAs you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 48:2–3\nwith your children, you might need to explain that people were coming to Ohio from the East, and they didn’t have a place to live. What did the Lord ask the Saints to do to help? Help your children think of things God has given them that they can share with others. You could also sing with them a song like “\n‘Give,’ Said the Little Stream\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 236).\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nAll who want to worship the Savior are welcome in meetings of His Saints."

He knows that sometimes sheep wander and the wilderness has many perils. So He lovingly leads us to the safety of His doctrine. He leads us away from dangers such as “false spirits, which have gone forth in the earth, deceiving the world” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:2\n). Following Him often means letting go of incorrect ideas or traditions. This was true for Leman Copley and others in Ohio. They had accepted the restored gospel but still held on to some beliefs that just weren’t correct. In\nDoctrine and Covenants 49\n, the Lord declared truths that corrected Leman’s previous beliefs about topics such as marriage and the Savior’s Second Coming. And when the Ohio converts “received … spirits which [they] could not understand,” the Lord taught them how to discern true manifestations of the Spirit (\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:15\n). The Good Shepherd is patient with us, His “little children,” who “must grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:40\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 49\n;\n50:24\nJesus Christ wants me to embrace the truths of His gospel.\nBefore joining the Church, Leman Copley had been part of a religious group known as the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, also known as the Shakers. After a conversation with Leman, Joseph Smith sought clarification from the Lord about some of the Shakers’ teachings. The Lord responded with the revelation in\nsection 49\n. Some of the Shakers’ beliefs are mentioned in the section heading.\nWhat did the Lord teach in\nsection 49\nto correct the beliefs of the Shakers? What evidence do you see in this revelation of His love and concern for people who do not have the fulness of His truth? How can you reach out to them with love and concern?\nWhat impresses you about the Lord’s observation in\nverse 2\n? You might compare this to what happens if you watch only part of a movie, see one piece of a puzzle, or hear one side of an argument. How does the Lord’s warning relate to\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:24\n? Consider what you’re doing to receive more light from the Lord.\nSee also “\nLeman Copley and the Shakers\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 117–21.\nDoctrine and Covenants 49:15–17\nMarriage between man and woman is essential to God’s plan.\nIn an effort to undermine Heavenly Father’s plan, Satan seeks to create confusion about marriage. The Lord, on the other hand, continues to reveal truth about marriage through His prophets. You can find some of this truth in\nDoctrine and Covenants 49:15–17\n;\nGenesis 2:20–24\n;\n1 Corinthians 11:11\n; and “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n.” Make a list of the truths you find. Why is marriage so important to God’s plan?\nElder Ulisses Soares taught that “the restored gospel of Jesus Christ proclaims the principle of full partnership between woman and man, both in mortal life and in the eternities” (“\nIn Partnership with the Lord\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 42). You might study his message, looking for principles “that strengthen the partnership between man and woman.” How can you apply these principles in your life? If someone of another faith asked you why marriage is important, how would you respond? Why are you grateful for this understanding?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nMarriage\n,” “\nFamily\n,” Gospel Library; David A. Bednar, “\nMarriage Is Essential to His Eternal Plan\n,”\nEnsign\n, June 2006, 83–84; “Renaissance of Marriage” (video), Gospel Library.\nRenaissance of Marriage\nBe sensitive to individual circumstances.\nWhile happy marriage and family life are the ideal in the gospel of Jesus Christ, we don’t all get to enjoy these blessings while in mortality. In discussing this topic, be sensitive to various individual and family circumstances, especially for people who are “waiting patiently on the Lord” for eternal promises to be fulfilled (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 98:1–3\n).\nDoctrine and Covenants 50\nThe Lord’s teachings can protect me from Satan’s deceptions.\nThe new members of the Church in Ohio were eager to receive the spiritual manifestations promised in the scriptures. Satan, however, was eager to deceive them. If you were asked to help these members understand how to recognize true manifestations of the Holy Ghost, what principles in\nDoctrine and Covenants 50\nwould you share? (see especially\nverses 22–25\n,\n29–34\n,\n40–46\n). How has the Savior helped you know the difference between truth and error?\nSee also\n1 Corinthians 14:1–28\n;\n2 Timothy 3:13–17\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:13–24\nTeachers and learners are edified together by the Spirit.\nLiving the gospel of Jesus Christ provides many opportunities to be teachers and learners, both at home and at Church. One way you might study\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:13–24\nis to draw a picture of a teacher and a learner. Next to each, make a list of words and phrases from these verses that teach you something about gospel learning and teaching. When have you had experiences that taught you the importance of the Spirit in teaching and learning? Consider what you can do to improve your efforts as a gospel learner and teacher.\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:23–25\n“That which is of God is light.”\nAs you ponder the Savior’s words in\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:23–25\n, think about how you receive God’s light in your life and how you “chase darkness” away. For example, how do these verses guide your choices about how to spend your time? what entertainment or media to seek? which conversations to engage in? What other decisions can these verses help you with? A hymn like “\nThe Lord Is My Light\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 89) might inspire additional thoughts.\nSee also “\nWalk in God’s light\n,”\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 16–21.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Leman Copley\nReligious Enthusiasm among Early Ohio Converts\nGifts of the Spirit\nReligious Beliefs in Joseph Smith’s Day\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 49:12–14\nI can follow Jesus Christ.\nTo teach your children the principles in these verses, you could prepare four paper footprints and four pictures that represent faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost (see the pictures in this week’s\nactivity page\n). Your children could place the footprints on the floor with the pictures beside them. Then they could take turns walking on the footprints while you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 49:12–14\n. Help them understand that when we do the things in these pictures, we are following Jesus Christ.\nYou could also invite your children to compare\nDoctrine and Covenants 49:12–14\nwith\nActs 2:38\nand with the\nfourth article of faith\n. What similarities do they find? Why are these truths important?\nDoctrine and Covenants 49:15–17\nMarriage between man and woman is essential to God’s plan.\nTo introduce these verses, you could explain that the Shakers were a religious group that believed people should not get married (see the section heading to\nDoctrine and Covenants 49\n).

Someone needed to print books and other publications. And someone needed to run a store to provide goods for people in Zion. In the revelations recorded in\nDoctrine and Covenants 51–57\n, the Lord appointed and instructed people to handle these tasks.\nBut while skills in such things are needed in Zion, these revelations also teach that the Lord desires His Saints to become spiritually worthy to be called a Zion people—His people. He calls each of us to be “a faithful, a just, and a wise steward,” having a contrite spirit, “stand[ing] fast” in our appointed responsibilities (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 51:19\n;\n52:15\n;\n54:2\n). If we can do that—regardless of our temporal skills—the Lord can use us to build Zion.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 51\nThe Lord wants me to be a faithful, just, and wise steward.\nIf you were a Church member in 1831, you might have been invited to live the law of consecration by signing over your property to the Church through the bishop. He would then return to you, in most cases, what you donated, sometimes with a surplus. But it was no longer just your possession—it was your stewardship.\nToday the procedures are different, but the principles are still vital to the Lord’s work. As you read\nsection 51\n, think about what God has entrusted to you. What do the words “steward” (\nverse 19\n) and “consecrated” (\nverse 5\n) imply about God’s expectations of you?\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball explained: “In the Church a stewardship is a sacred spiritual or temporal trust for which there is accountability. Because all things belong to the Lord, we are stewards over our bodies, minds, families, and properties. (See\nDoctrine and Covenants 104:11–15\n.) A faithful steward is one who exercises righteous dominion, cares for his own, and looks to the poor and needy” (“\nWelfare Services: The Gospel in Action\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1977, 78).\nSee also “\nThe Law of Consecration\n” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Law of Consecration\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:9–11, 22–27\nI can invite others to come unto Christ wherever I go.\nWhen the Lord sent several Church leaders to Missouri, he told them to make use of the time spent traveling and “preach by the way” (\nverses 25–27\n). How can you share the gospel “by the way,” or during the normal events of your life?\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:14–19\nThe Lord helps me avoid deception.\nWith many people claiming spiritual manifestations, the early Saints were concerned about being deceived. What warning did the Lord give them in\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:14\n? What was His solution? (see\nverses 14–19\n).\nA pattern is something that repeats in a regular, predictable way. Examples include counting by even numbers or the sun rising and setting each day. What other examples can you think of? As you search\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:14–19\n, identify the Lord’s pattern for avoiding deception. It might help to note that “contrite” implies a feeling of humility and repentance; “meek” suggests gentleness and self-control; and to “edify” means to instruct, improve, or build up. Why do you feel the Lord’s pattern includes these qualities, as well as obedience? How can you apply this pattern to avoid deception?\nDefine difficult words.\nIn the Gospel Library app, you can tap and hold a word and then select “Define.” You will then be taken to a definition of that word. Try this when you come across unfamiliar words—or words that seem familiar that you’d like to understand better.\nWhat are some examples of deceptions in our day? How can we know when we are being deceived?\nFor instance, you might consider evaluating your choices regarding movies, music, and social media based on the standards in “\nWalk in God’s light\n” in\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 16–21.\nSee also Gary E. Stevenson, “\nDeceive Me Not\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 93–96; “\nGuide Me to Thee\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 101; Topics and Questions, “\nSeeking Truth and Avoiding Deception\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 54\nI can turn to the Lord when I am hurt by others’ choices.\nHave you ever suffered disappointment when someone you depended on didn’t keep their commitments? This happened to the Saints from Colesville, New York, who expected to settle on Leman Copley’s land in Ohio. To learn from this experience, consider reviewing the heading to\nsection 54\n(see also\nSaints\n,\n1:125–28\n; “\nA Bishop unto the Church\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 78–79). If you had a friend among the Colesville Saints, what counsel could you find in\nsection 54\nto share with them?\nLeman Copley’s farm\nDoctrine and Covenants 56:14–20\nBlessed are the pure in heart.\nIn these verses, the Lord spoke both to the rich and to the poor; it might be interesting to compare His counsel to these two groups. What in these verses feels relevant to you personally?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Newel Knight\nZion/New Jerusalem\nLamanite Identity\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 51:9\nI can be honest.\nTo help your children learn what it means to be honest, you could read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 51:9\nand share stories of children who face decisions about being honest. You could use pictures, sock puppets, or paper dolls to make the stories more interesting. How does the Lord bless us as we strive to be honest?\nConsider playing a game with your children. Afterward, discuss how the game would have been different if someone had cheated. Why is it important to “deal honestly” with each other?\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:10\n;\n53:3\n;\n55:1\nI receive the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands.\nReceiving the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands is mentioned several times in\nDoctrine and Covenants 51–57\n. This might be a good opportunity to teach your children about this ordinance. For example, they could look at a picture of a child being confirmed and describe what is happening in the picture. Ask them to clap their hands when they hear “laying on of the hands” or “laying on of hands” while you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:10\n;\n53:3\n;\n55:1\n.\nYou could also sing “\nThe Holy Ghost\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 105) or a similar song. Help your children find words and phrases in the song that teach about the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:14–19\nGod has a pattern to help me not be deceived.\nTo teach about the Lord’s pattern for avoiding deception, you might start by helping children find examples of patterns—in nature, in colorful blankets or clothing, or in daily life.

Some thought they would find a thriving, industrious community with a strong group of Saints. Instead, they found a sparsely populated outpost, lacking the civilization they were used to and inhabited by rough frontier settlers rather than Saints. It turned out that the Lord wasn’t asking them just to come to Zion—He wanted them to\nbuild\nZion.\nWhen our expectations do not match reality, we can remember what the Lord told the Saints in 1831: “Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God … and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:3\n). Yes, life is full of tribulation, even wickedness, but we can still “bring to pass much righteousness; for the power is in [us]” (\nverses 27–28\n).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:127–33\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:1–5\n;\n59:23\n“After much tribulation come the blessings.”\nThe Saints hoped that during their lifetimes, Jackson County would blossom into Zion, a place where all the Saints could gather.

        "How is your testimony of the gospel like a “talent,” or a treasure from God? In what ways do we sometimes “hide [our] talent”? ( Doctrine and Covenants 60:2 ; see also Matthew 25:14–30 ).",
        "What encouraging messages from the Lord do you find in sections 60 and 62 ? How do these messages build your confidence in sharing the gospel? As you ponder these questions, consider singing or reading the words to “ I Want to Be a Missionary Now ” ( Children’s Songbook , 168). What do you learn from this children’s song about sharing the gospel?",
        "See also the “ Sharing the Gospel ” collection in Gospel Library.",
        "As He instructed His missionaries, the Lord revealed important truths about Himself. Look for these truths in Doctrine and Covenants 60:2–4 ; 61:1–2, 20, 36–38 ; 62:1, 6 . What accounts from the scriptures illustrate the roles and attributes of the Savior that you found? (see, for example, John 8:1–11 ; Ether 2:14–15 ).",
        "The Lord gives direction about eternal truths and principles, but He often leaves it to us to determine the specific details about how to act on these principles. How do you see this principle illustrated in Doctrine and Covenants 62 ? (see also Doctrine and Covenants 60:5 ; 61:22 ). How have you seen this principle in your life? Why is it good for us to make some decisions without expecting God to tell us exactly what to do?",
        "See also Ether 2:18–25 ; Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 .",
        "At the end of this outline, there’s an illustration of a miracle that deeply impressed Ezra Booth: Elsa Johnson’s arm was miraculously healed. After seeing that, Ezra was eagerly baptized. And yet, within just a few months, Ezra lost his faith and became critical of the Prophet. How could this be, considering the miracle he’d witnessed?",
        "Ponder this as you read Doctrine and Covenants 63:7–12 . What truths do you learn about signs and faith?",
        "See also Matthew 16:1–4 ; John 12:37 ; Mormon 9:10–21 ; Ether 12:12, 18 .",
        "In Doctrine and Covenants 63:16 , the Savior reaffirmed what He taught in the New Testament—that the law of chastity should govern not just our actions but also our thoughts (see Matthew 5:27–28 ). As you read Doctrine and Covenants 63:16 , write down the warnings the Savior gives about lustful thoughts. You might also ponder the opposite of each warning. For example, what are some words or phrases that are the opposite of fear? What other blessings come from having chaste thoughts and actions?",
        "Many people think the Lord’s standards of chastity of thought and action are old-fashioned or even oppressive. What difference would it make if all of God’s children were striving to live this law? You might look for answers to this question in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “ We Believe in Being Chaste ” ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2013, 41–44) or “ Your body is sacred ” ( For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices , 23–26). What messages of hope do you find?",
        "Even when we know the blessings of being chaste in our thoughts and actions, that doesn’t mean it’s easy. You might take some time to ponder what makes it difficult for you to keep the Savior’s standard of chastity—and what makes it easier. What tips might you share with others about what to do when you are tempted with unworthy thoughts?",
        "See also Doctrine and Covenants 121:45 ; Topics and Questions, “ Virtue ,” Gospel Library; “Standards: Sexual Purity and Modesty—True Confidence” (video), Gospel Library; AddressingPornography.ChurchofJesusChrist.org .",
        "The principles in Doctrine and Covenants 63:58–64 go beyond taking the Lord’s name in vain. What other sacred things come “from above,” or from God? What does it mean for you to speak of these things “with care”?",

The Lord had wanted them to preach the gospel during their trip (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 52:10\n), and some of them did so diligently. But others were hesitant. “They hide the talent which I have given unto them,” the Lord said, “because of the fear of man” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 60:2\n). Many of us know how these elders felt. Even though we love the gospel, fear and doubt might keep us from sharing it. But the Lord is merciful. He “knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor [us]” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 62:1\n). Scattered throughout these revelations to early missionaries are reassurances that can help us overcome our fears and shortcomings: “I am able to make you holy.” “All flesh is in mine hand.” “I am with the faithful always.” And “He that is faithful and endureth shall overcome the world.” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 60:7\n;\n61:6\n;\n62:9\n;\n63:47\n.)\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 60\n;\n62\nI can share my love and testimony of Jesus Christ.\nHow is your testimony of the gospel like a “talent,” or a treasure from God? In what ways do we sometimes “hide [our] talent”? (\nDoctrine and Covenants 60:2\n; see also\nMatthew 25:14–30\n).\nWhat encouraging messages from the Lord do you find in\nsections 60\nand\n62\n? How do these messages build your confidence in sharing the gospel? As you ponder these questions, consider singing or reading the words to “\nI Want to Be a Missionary Now\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 168).

How can the promise in\nverse 9\nhelp if we feel nervous?\nDoctrine and Covenants 63:64\nI can be reverent.\nTo introduce\nDoctrine and Covenants 63:64\n, you could sing a song about reverence with your children, such as “\nReverence Is Love\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, no. 31). Then you could talk about different ways to show reverence for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nYou can help your children understand what reverence is by talking with them about an item that is special to them, such as a favorite toy, book, or blanket. Ask them how they take care of and protect things that are special to them. You could then read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 63:64\n. What things are special—or sacred—to Heavenly Father? (see, for example,\nverse 61\nand this week’s\nactivity page\n). How should we treat these things—with our words and our actions?\nReverence for Sacred Things\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nHealing of Elsa Johnson’s Shoulder\n, by Sam Lawlor"

The travelers were hot and weary, and tensions soon turned into quarrels. It may have seemed like building Zion, a city of love, unity, and peace, was going to take a long time.\nFortunately, building Zion—in Missouri in 1831 or in our hearts, families, and wards today—doesn’t require us to be perfect. Instead, “of you it is required to forgive,” the Lord said (\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:10\n). He requires “the heart and a willing mind” (\nverse 34\n). And He requires patience and diligence, for Zion is built on the foundation of “small things,” accomplished by those who do not become “weary in well-doing” (\nverse 33\n).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:133–34\n,\n136–37\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:1–11\n“Forgive one another.”\nConsider the following as you study\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:1–11\n:\nThink about a time when the Lord forgave you. How did you feel?\nIs there someone you need to forgive? Why can forgiving others be so difficult? What helps you overcome these difficulties?\nWhat truths about forgiveness in\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:1–11\nseem important to you? Why do you think the Lord commands us “to forgive all”? (\nverse 10\n).\nIf you struggle to forgive, consider studying Elder Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “\nThe Ministry of Reconciliation\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 77–79) or Kristin M. Yee’s message “\nBeauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 36–38). What do you learn about how Christ can help you forgive?\nFamily relationships can provide many opportunities to forgive. Think about your family members. Whom do you need to forgive? How are we “afflicted” (\nverse 8\n) when we don’t forgive each other? How would forgiveness affect your family relationships?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nForgiveness\n,” Gospel Library; “Forgiveness: My Burden Was Made Light” (video), Gospel Library.\nForgiveness: My Burden Was Made Light\n“Ye ought to forgive one another” (Doctrine and Covenants 64:9).\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:31–34\nThe Lord asks for my “heart and a willing mind.”\nHave you ever felt “weary” with all the “well-doing” you’re trying to accomplish? Look for the Lord’s message to you in\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:31–34\n. What does the Lord want you to do to bring about His “great work”?\nThink of an object lesson that would illustrate\nverse 33\n—something large that’s made up of small things, like a mosaic or a brick building. What “small things” can you do every day to “[lay] the foundation” of God’s great work? What are some examples of the “great work” that the Lord has given you?\nBe not Weary in Well-doing\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:31–34\n“The heart and a willing mind”\nElder Donald L. Hallstrom suggested this possible meaning for the phrase “heart and a willing mind”:\n“The heart is symbolic of love and commitment. We make sacrifices and bear burdens for those we love that we would not endure for any other reason. If love does not exist, our commitment wanes. …\n“Having ‘a willing mind’ connotes giving our best effort and finest thinking and seeking God’s wisdom. It suggests that our most devoted lifetime study should be of things that are eternal in nature. It means that there must be an inextricable relationship between hearing the word of God and obeying it” (“\nThe Heart and a Willing Mind\n,”\nEnsign\n, June 2011, 31–32).\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:41–43\nZion shall be “an ensign unto the people.”\nAn ensign is “a flag or standard around which people gather in a unity of purpose or identity” (Guide to the Scriptures, “\nEnsign\n,” Gospel Library). How has Zion—or the Lord’s Church—been like an ensign to you? Consider these other examples of things that are held up, like an ensign, to bless the people:\nNumbers 21:6–9\n;\nMatthew 5:14–16\n;\nAlma 46:11–20\n. Look for other ways the Lord describes Zion in\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:41–43\n.\nSee also “\nLet Zion in Her Beauty Rise\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 41.\nDoctrine and Covenants 65\nThe kingdom of God on earth prepares the world for the Savior’s return.\nDoctrine and Covenants 65\ngives an inspiring description of the mission of the Lord’s Church in the latter days. Consider searching this section, looking for answers to questions like these: What does the Lord want His kingdom to accomplish on the earth? What does He want me to do to help?\nSee also “Prepare Today for the Second Coming” (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nPrepare Today for the Second Coming\nDoctrine and Covenants 66\nThe Lord knows the thoughts of my heart.\nShortly after joining the Church, William E. McLellin asked Joseph Smith to reveal God’s will for him. Joseph didn’t know it, but William had five personal questions he was hoping the Lord would answer through His Prophet. We don’t know what William’s questions were, but the revelation addressed to him, now\nDoctrine and Covenants 66\n, answered each question to William’s “full and entire satisfaction” (“\nWilliam McLellin’s Five Questions\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 138).\nAs you read\nsection 66\n, think about what the Lord knew about William McLellin and the concerns and intents of his heart. How has the Lord shown you that He knows you? If you have a patriarchal blessing, consider studying it. As you do, what does the Holy Ghost help you understand about God’s will for you?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: William E. McLellin\nWilliam McLellin’s Five Questions\nIsaac and Lucy Morley Farm\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:7–10\nJesus Christ wants me to forgive everyone.\nNote:\nAs you teach your children about the Lord’s command “to forgive all,” you may want to clarify that forgiving does not mean allowing people to hurt us. Encourage them to tell a trusted adult if someone hurts them or touches them inappropriately.\nAfter reading\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:10\nwith your children, talk with them about what it means to forgive someone. You might share a few simple examples. Perhaps they could role-play these examples to practice forgiving.\nYou might ask your children to plan how they would teach someone—such as a younger sibling—about forgiving others. Help them find phrases in\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:7–10\nthat they could use as they teach.\nSing a song about forgiveness, such as “\nHelp Me, Dear Father\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 99). What does this song teach us about forgiving others?\nThe Goal: A Story of Faith, Friendship and Forgiveness\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:33\nGod’s “great work” is built on “small things.”\nYou could show your children some things that are made up of small parts, like a puzzle or a rug. Then you could read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:33\n. What is God’s “great work”? What are the “small things” we can do that will help?\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:34\nI can follow Jesus with my heart and mind.\nAs you read to your children from\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:34\n, you could point to your heart and head as you read “heart” and “mind,” and invite the children to do it with you. How can we give our hearts (desires) and minds (thoughts) to the Savior?\nEmphasize the example of Jesus Christ.\nConsider how you can emphasize the example of the Savior when you study or teach. For example, when teaching about\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:34\n, you could talk with your children about how the Savior gave His heart (desires) and mind (thoughts) to His Father in Heaven. (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n6\n.)\nDoctrine and Covenants 66\nThe Lord knows who I am and loves me.\nHelp your children understand that William E. McLellin had five questions for the Lord. Joseph Smith received answers to these questions even though he did not know what William’s questions were. Tell your children about a time when the Lord showed you what He wanted you to do, and talk about the blessings that came from following His direction. You could then read\nDoctrine and Covenants 66:4\ntogether and invite your children to seek opportunities to understand what the Lord wants them to do.\nDetail from\nThe Second Coming\n, by Kevin Keele\nDoctrine and Covenants 65\nI can help prepare the world to receive Jesus Christ.\nAs your children look at a picture of the Savior’s Second Coming, ask them to describe what they see or what they know about this event. You could also give your children words and phrases about the Second Coming to find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 65\n. What do these words and phrases teach us? How can we prepare for the Savior’s return?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nForgiven\n, by Greg Olsen\nOpen PDF"

      "plain_text": "“June 23–29: ‘Worth … the Riches of the Whole Earth’: Doctrine and Covenants 67–70,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Doctrine and Covenants 2025\n(2025)\n“Doctrine and Covenants 67–70,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2025\nJune 23–29: “Worth … the Riches of the Whole Earth”\nDoctrine and Covenants 67–70\nFrom 1828 to 1831, the Prophet Joseph Smith received many revelations from the Lord, including divine counsel for individuals, instructions on governing the Church, visions of the latter days, and many inspiring truths of eternity. But many of the Saints hadn’t read them. The revelations weren’t yet published, and the few available copies were handwritten on loose sheets that were circulated among members and carried around by missionaries.\nThen, in November 1831, Joseph called a council of Church leaders to discuss publishing the revelations. After seeking the Lord’s will, these leaders made plans to publish the Book of Commandments—the precursor to today’s Doctrine and Covenants. Soon everyone would be able to read for themselves the word of God revealed through a living prophet, vivid evidence that “the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of our Savior are again entrusted to man.” For these and many other reasons, Saints then and now consider these revelations to be “worth … the riches of the whole Earth” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 70\n, section heading).\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:140–43\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 67:1–9\n;\n68:3–6\nThe Lord’s servants speak His will when moved upon by the Holy Ghost.\nThe decision to publish the revelations received by Joseph Smith seems like an easy one, but some early Church leaders weren’t sure it was a good idea. One concern had to do with imperfections in the way Joseph Smith wrote the revelations. The revelation in\nsection 67\ncame in response to that concern. What do you learn about the Lord’s prophets and revelation from\nverses 1–9\n? What additional insights do you gain from\n68:3–6\n?\nHow have you come to know for yourself that the revelations God gives His servants are true? You might also ponder experiences when you felt the Lord was speaking to you through one of His servants (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:4\n). When have you felt “moved upon by the Holy Ghost” (\nverse 3\n) to say something? How did the Lord “stand by you”? (\nverse 6\n).\nBefore the Book of Commandments was printed, several Church leaders signed a written testimony that the revelations in the book are true. To see a copy of their testimony, see “\nTestimony, circa 2 November 1831\n,”\nRevelation Book 1\n, 121,\njosephsmithpapers.org\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 67:10–14\n“Continue in patience.”\nHow do jealousy, fear, and pride keep us from growing closer to the Lord? How do we overcome the “natural man” or “carnal mind” so that we can “see [Him] and know that [He is]”? (\nverse 10\n; see also\nMosiah 3:19\n). What do you find in these verses that inspires you to “continue in patience until ye are perfected”? (\nverse 13\n).\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–31\nI can help center my home on Jesus Christ.\nThe Lord’s words in\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–31\nrefer specifically to parents, but whether or not you’re a parent, you can use His counsel to do your part to center your home on the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Listed below are some of the principles the Lord says should be taught in the home. Consider how you can make each one of these part of the foundation of a Christ-centered home—the home you live in now or your future home. The resources and questions provided can help.\nRepentance\n: Study\nAlma 36:17–20\n, and notice how Alma was blessed at a critical time because his father had taught him about the Savior’s atoning mission. How can you help inspire your family to turn to Jesus Christ and repent? (see also\n2 Nephi 25:26\n).\nFaith in Christ\n: Read President Russell M. Nelson’s five suggestions for developing faith in “\nChrist Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 103). Ponder how these suggestions could create a culture of faith in your family.\nBaptism\n: Review the baptismal covenant as described in\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n. How can your efforts to keep this covenant strengthen your family?\nGift of the Holy Ghost\n: Study the invitations on\npages 17–19\nof\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n. What do you feel inspired to do to invite the influence of the Holy Ghost in your home?\nPrayer\n: What do you learn about the power of prayer in the home in “\nLove Is Spoken Here\n”? (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 190–91). What blessings does the Savior promise in\n3 Nephi 18:15–21\n?\nOther principles you find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–31\n:\nWhat counsel would you give to someone whose family members don’t support their efforts to build faith in Christ?\nSee also “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n,” Gospel Library; Topics and Questions, “\nParenting\n,” Gospel Library; Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nJesus Christ Is the Strength of Parents\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 55–59.\nDoctrine and Covenants 69:1\n“True and faithful” friends help me follow Jesus Christ.\nWhy do you think it was “wisdom in [the Lord]” for someone “true and faithful” to accompany Oliver Cowdery on the assignment described in this verse? How does this principle apply to you?\nHelp learners lift each other.\nEach individual in your class or family is a rich source of testimony, insights, and experiences living the gospel. Invite them to share with and lift each other.\nDoctrine and Covenants 70:1–4\nI am accountable for the revelations the Lord has given.\nThe Lord gave certain elders the responsibility to oversee the publishing of the revelations. Even though you do not have that specific responsibility, what is your stewardship or responsibility “over the revelations and commandments”? (\nverse 3\n).\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: William W. Phelps\nBook of Commandments\nRevelations of Joseph Smith\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 67\nThe Doctrine and Covenants teaches me about Jesus Christ.\nTell your children about how Joseph Smith’s revelations came to be printed in a book (see “\nChapter 23: The Doctrine and Covenants\n,” in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 90–92, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). Help them remember some of the things you’ve learned about Jesus Christ from Doctrine and Covenants so far this year. You might also share with each other some of your favorite verses from Doctrine and Covenants.\nChapter 23: The Doctrine and Covenants: August–November 1831\nMary and Carolline Rollins\nYou could also show your children the Bible, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and Pearl of Great Price and talk with them about how they are different and how they are similar (see the descriptions of these books in\nGuide to the Scriptures\n). How can we know that the scriptures are true? What do we learn from\nDoctrine and Covenants 67:4\n,\n9\nabout the revelations the Lord gave to Joseph Smith?\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–31\nI can be baptized when I am eight years old.\nIn\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:27\n, the Lord specified how old a person must be to be baptized. Help your children discover what He said. Why does Jesus want us to be baptized? A song like “\nBaptism\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 100–101) can help. Using pictures or\nverses 25–31\n(or both), help your children discover things the Lord wants children to learn.\nRead with your children about the assignment the Lord gave Oliver Cowdery in the section heading for\nDoctrine and Covenants 69\n.

But it must have been particularly difficult in late 1831 when Ezra Booth began publicly berating the Church, because in this case the critic was a former believer. Ezra had seen Joseph use God’s power to heal a woman. He had been invited to accompany Joseph on the first survey of the land of Zion in Missouri. But he had since lost his faith and, in an attempt to discredit the Prophet, published a series of letters in an Ohio newspaper. And his efforts seemed to be working, because “unfriendly feelings … had developed against the Church” in the area (\nDoctrine and Covenants 71\n, section heading). What should believers do in a case like that? While there is not one right answer for every situation, it seems that often—including in this case in 1831—part of the Lord’s answer is to declare the truth and correct falsehoods by “proclaiming [the] gospel” (\nverse 1\n). Yes, the Lord’s work will always have critics, but in the end, “no weapon that is formed against [it] shall prosper” (\nverse 9\n).\nSee “\nEzra Booth and Isaac Morley\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 134.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 71\nThe Spirit will guide me as I proclaim the Savior’s gospel.\nIt can be troubling when people criticize or ridicule your faith in the Savior, His gospel, or His Church. When that happens, what do you do? Something similar happened in Ohio in 1831 (see the section heading to\nDoctrine and Covenants 71\n). What did the Lord tell Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon to do about it in\nDoctrine and Covenants 71\n? Maybe you could list instructions the Lord gave them and blessings He promised.\nIn addition to studying\nsection 71\n, you might also explore how the Savior responded to His critics during His mortal ministry. Here are some examples:\nMatthew 22:15–22\n;\n26:59–64\n;\nJohn 10:37–38\n. What do you learn from Him? What additional insights do you gain from\nMatthew 18:15\n;\nEphesians 4:31–32\n;\n2 Timothy 3:12\n;\nJames 1:19\n?\nHow might His counsel apply to situations you face today? You might consider ways to peacefully correct falsehoods in your own words. For example, you might start by expressing respect for the other person’s views, and then you could share in a humble and kind way what you believe about Jesus Christ and His teachings. To prepare for these occasions, perhaps you could practice this approach with friends or family members.\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nHelping Others with Questions\n,” Gospel Library; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nLoving Others and Living with Differences\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2014, 25–28; Jörg Klebingat, “\nValiant Discipleship in the Latter Days\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 107–10.\nDoctrine and Covenants 72\nThe Lord blesses me through the ministry of leaders like bishops.\nWhen Newel K. Whitney was called to serve as a bishop, his duties were a little different from those of today’s bishops. For example, Bishop Whitney oversaw the consecration of property and permission to settle in the land of Zion in Missouri. But as you read about his calling in\nDoctrine and Covenants 72\n, you might notice some connections to what bishops do today—at least in the spirit, if not the specifics, of their duties.\nFor example, in what ways do you “render an account” to your bishop? (\nverse 5\n). In our day, “the Lord’s storehouse” can include the donations, service, and talents of ward members (see\nverses 10, 12\n). How can you contribute to that storehouse?\nHow has the Lord blessed you and your family through the service of a bishop?\nSee also Quentin L. Cook, “\nBishops—Shepherds over the Lord’s Flock\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 56–60.\nDoctrine and Covenants 73\nI have many opportunities to share the Savior’s gospel.\nWhen Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon returned from their missionary assignment (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 71\n), the Lord told them to continue their translation of the Bible (see Guide to the Scriptures, “\nJoseph Smith Translation (JST)\n,” Gospel Library). But that didn’t mean He wanted them to stop sharing the gospel. After all, it’s part of the life of a disciple.\nAs you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 73\n, consider how you can make sharing the gospel an ongoing, “practicable” (\nverse 4\n)—or realistic—part of your life among your other responsibilities.\nChurch Leaders Share Their First Invitation to Church | Love, Share, Invite\nSharing the gospel of Jesus Christ can be normal and natural.\nDoctrine and Covenants 75:1–16\n“Labor with your might … proclaiming the truth.”\nThe revelation in\nsection 75\nwas addressed to people who had “given [their] names to go forth to proclaim [the Savior’s] gospel” (\nverse 2\n). One way to study this revelation is to make two lists: (1) how to share the gospel effectively and (2) how the Lord blesses and supports us as we do.\nWhat do you think it means to “tarry” or “be idle” in sharing the gospel? What does it look like to “labor with your might”? (\nverse 3\n).\nSee also “\nI’ll Go Where You Want Me to Go\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 270.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Newel K.

What do you learn about God in Doctrine and Covenants 76:5–10 , 114–18 ? What do these verses teach about how you can understand “the good pleasure of [God’s] will”? ( verse 7 )."

For centuries, many Christian traditions, relying on biblical teachings, have taught of heaven and hell, of paradise for the righteous and torment for the wicked. But can the entire human family really be divided so strictly? In February 1832, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon wondered if there was more to know about the subject (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 76\n, section heading).\nThere certainly was. While Joseph and Sidney were pondering these things, the Lord “touched the eyes of [their] understandings and they were opened” (\nverse 19\n). They received a revelation so stunning, so expansive, so illuminating that the Saints simply called it “the Vision.” It threw open heaven’s windows and gave God’s children a mind-stretching view of eternity. The vision revealed that heaven is grander and broader and more inclusive than most people had previously supposed. God is more merciful and just than we can comprehend. And God’s children have an eternal destiny more glorious than we can imagine.\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:147–50\n; “\nThe Vision\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 148–54.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 76\nSalvation comes through Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\nSection 76\nreveals important truths about our eternal destiny, but it would be incomplete to say that this revelation is about the three kingdoms of glory or even just about the plan of salvation. More accurately,\nsection 76\nis about Jesus Christ, who makes God’s plan for our salvation and eternal glory possible. As you read, you might look for words or phrases that describe the relationship between Jesus Christ and the people who inherit the different kingdoms of glory. Perhaps a table like the following could help you record what you find.\nKingdom of glory\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nEternal blessings\nKingdom of glory\nCelestial (\nverses 50–70\n,\n92–96\n)\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nReceived testimony of Jesus\nMade and kept covenants with Him\nEternal blessings\nCleansed from sin\nOvercome by faith\nKingdom of glory\nTerrestrial (\nverses 71–79\n,\n97\n)\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nEternal blessings\nKingdom of glory\nTelestial (\nverses 81–90\n,\n98–106\n,\n109–12\n)\nRelationship with Jesus Christ\nEternal blessings\nWhat do you feel inspired to do to strengthen your relationship with the Savior?\nWhen Wilford Woodruff read this vision, he said, “I felt to love the Lord more than ever before in my life” (see “\nVoices of the Restoration: Testimonies of ‘the Vision’\n”). What do you learn about Jesus Christ from\nverses 1–5\n,\n20–24\n,\n39–43\n,\n107–8\nthat causes you to love Him more?\nSee also\n1 Peter 3:18–19\n;\n4:6\n; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nWhat Has Our Savior Done for Us?\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 75–77; “\nI Stand All Amazed\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 193.\nFocus on Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and Their doctrine.\nOf everything we can learn in the scriptures, the most important truths help us build faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, repent, make and keep covenants with Them, and receive the Holy Ghost. Although it may be interesting to compare or analyze the attitudes or behavior of people who will receive the different kingdoms of glory, it’s more important to focus on Heavenly Father and the Savior. Everything They do to prepare us for that glory will turn us toward Them.\nIn this room, Joseph Smith saw the vision recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 76.\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:5–10\n,\n114–18\nI can understand God’s will “by the power of the Holy Spirit.”\nNot all members of the Church easily accepted the revelation in\nsection 76\n, because it taught that almost everyone would be saved and receive some degree of glory. For example, Brigham Young said: “My traditions were such, that when the Vision came first to me, it was directly contrary and opposed to my former education. I said, Wait a little. I did not reject it; but I could not understand it.” He explained that he had to “think and pray, to read and think, until I knew and fully understood it for myself” (in “\nThe Vision\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 150). What do you learn from his experience that can help you when God reveals things that are different from your current understanding? What do you learn about God in\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:5–10\n,\n114–18\n? What do these verses teach about how you can understand “the good pleasure of [God’s] will”? (\nverse 7\n).\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:39–44, 50–70\nExaltation is the highest form of salvation.\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:39–44\ndescribe salvation generally.\nVerses 50–70\ndescribe exaltation, a specific kind of salvation. How would you explain the difference between salvation and exaltation? What is the Savior’s role in both? What do you find in these verses that inspires you to seek exaltation?\nSee also\nJohn 3:16–17\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 132:20–25\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:50–70, 92–95\nMy Heavenly Father wants me to receive eternal life in the celestial kingdom.\nHave you ever wondered—or worried—about whether you can become the kind of person who will receive celestial glory, as described in\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:50–70, 92–95\n?

In March 1832, Joseph Smith met with other Church leaders “to discuss Church business”: the need to publish revelations, purchase land to gather on, and care for the poor (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 78, section heading\n). To meet these needs, the Lord called on a small number of Church leaders to form the United Firm, a group that would join their efforts to “advance the cause” of the Lord (\nverse 4\n) in these areas. But even in such administrative matters, the Lord focused on the things of eternity. Ultimately, the purpose of a printing press or a storehouse—like everything else in God’s kingdom—is to prepare His children to receive “a place in the celestial world” and “the riches of eternity” (\nverses 7, 18\n). And if those blessings are hard to comprehend right now, in the midst of the busyness of daily life, He reassures us, “Be of good cheer, for I will lead you along” (\nverse 18\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 77\nGod gives knowledge to people who seek it.\nAs Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon worked on the inspired translation of the Bible, they had questions about the book of Revelation, as many people do. And as Joseph knew well, when he lacked wisdom, he could ask of God. The insights he gained are in\nDoctrine and Covenants 77\n. As you read this section, consider recording your insights in the relevant chapters in the book of Revelation. What do you learn from your study about receiving revelation?\nTranslation of the Bible\n, by Liz Lemon Swindle\nDoctrine and Covenants 78\nWhat was the United Firm?\nThe United Firm was established to manage the Church’s publishing and business affairs in Ohio and Missouri. It consisted of Joseph Smith, Newel K. Whitney, and other Church leaders who combined their resources to meet the temporal needs of the growing Church. Unfortunately, the United Firm fell into debt and was dissolved in 1834 when the debts became unmanageable.\nSee also “\nNewel K. Whitney and the United Firm\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 142–47; Church History Topics, “\nUnited Firm (‘United Order’)\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:1–7\nI can help “advance the cause” of Christ and His Church.\nThe Lord told Joseph Smith and other Church leaders that managing a storehouse and a printing press would help “advance the cause, which ye have espoused” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:4\n). What would you say is the “cause” of the Savior’s Church? Ponder this as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:1–7\n. What are some of the various ways you can help advance that cause—including in your family?\nSee also\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n1.2\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:17–18\nThe Lord will lead me along.\nWhy do you think the Lord sometimes calls His followers “little children”? (\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:17\n). When have you felt like a little child, perhaps because of something you “have not as yet understood” or “cannot bear”? (\nverses 17–18\n). What do you find in these verses that can help you “be of good cheer” (\nverse 18\n) in such times? Consider finding a picture of yourself when you were a child, and ponder how you have grown spiritually since then. Or think of something that was hard for you when you were young but is easier now. In what ways does Heavenly Father still want you to be like a child? (see\nMosiah 3:19\n). How is He “[leading] you along”?\nI Will Lead You Along\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:19\nI can receive all things with thankfulness.\nTo prepare to study\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:19\n, you could make a list of good things that have happened to you today. Then make a list of things that don’t really seem like blessings to you. Ponder these lists as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:19\n. What difference does it make in your life if you receive “all things” with thankfulness—even things that might not seem like blessings?\nTo learn more about how gratitude to God can influence your life, explore these scriptures and make a list of the truths you find:\nPsalm 107:8–9\n;\nLuke 17:11–19\n;\nPhilippians 4:6–7\n;\nMosiah 2:19–24\n;\nAlma 34:38\n;\n37:37\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:32\n;\n59:7, 15–21\n.\nConsider searching President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “\nGrateful in Any Circumstances\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2014, 70–77) for counsel about how to be grateful. You could look for similar counsel in the video “President Russell M. Nelson on the Healing Power of Gratitude” (Gospel Library). How does gratitude affect your relationship with Jesus Christ?\nPresident Russell M. Nelson on the Healing Power of Gratitude\nSearch and share.\nIf you are assigned to teach, look for ways to help people search the scriptures or words of prophets—on their own or in small groups—and share what they learn. For example, in this activity you could give each individual or group a section of President Uchtdorf’s message and ask them to share a phrase or sentence that they feel summarizes what he taught.\nSee also “\nCount Your Blessings\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 241; Topics and Questions, “\nGratitude\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 79–80\nThe call to serve God matters more than where I serve.\nRegarding\nDoctrine and Covenants 80\n, Elder David A. Bednar taught, “Perhaps one of the lessons the Savior is teaching us in this revelation is that an assignment to labor in a specific place is essential and important but secondary to a call to the work” (“\nCalled to the Work\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 68). What experiences have helped you learn that Elder Bednar’s words are true? What additional lessons can you find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 79–80\nthat could help someone who has just received a calling?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Stephen Burnett\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Newel K. Whitney\nNewel K. Whitney and the United Firm\nJoseph Smith Translation of the Bible\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 77:2\nGod created every creature on earth.\nAs you and your children read\nDoctrine and Covenants 77:2\ntogether, you might look at pictures of animals, including insects and birds. Your children could point to the pictures when you read the words “beasts,” “creeping things,” and “fowls of the air.” Share with each other how God’s creations help you feel His love.\nGod created all creatures on earth.\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:4\nI can help “advance the cause” of Jesus Christ.\nTo help your children think about their roles in the Lord’s work, consider reading with them\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:4\nto identify the “cause” we “espoused” (accepted or chose to support) when we were baptized. Help them look in scripture passages like these for possible answers:\nMosiah 18:8–10\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n;\nMoses 1:39\n. Your children might enjoy role-playing how they can help with the Lord’s work. For example, what does it look like to “bear one another’s burdens” or “take upon [ourselves] the name of Jesus Christ”? How does this “advance the cause” of Christ?\nParticipate to Prepare for Christ’s Return\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:6\nI can share what I have with others.\nTo teach what it means to be “equal in earthly things” (\nverse 6\n), you could give your children pictures of people in need (hungry, injured, or cold) and objects that would help (such as food, a bandage, or a blanket). Then your children could match the pictures with the objects. What can we share to help people in need?\nTo get some context for\nsection 78\n, read with your children the sentences under the first two pictures of “\nChapter 28: The Prophet Joseph Goes to Missouri Again\n” (in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 108, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). Then your children could pretend they are helping someone build a house, sharing food, or serving in another way.\nChapter 28: The Prophet Joseph Goes to Missouri Again: March–May 1832\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:18\nJesus Christ will lead me along.\nIt may be fun for your children to talk about what it means to be a leader and then lead an activity. After reading together\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:18\n, you could discuss times when we need Jesus to lead us. Consider singing a song such as “\nI Will Walk with Jesus\n” (Gospel Library).\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:19\nI can receive “all things with thankfulness.”\nRead with your children\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:19\nto discover what the Lord promises to people who are thankful. Help your children understand what “an hundred fold” means, perhaps by showing them a small object and then 100 of that same object. Perhaps they could draw pictures of things they have received from God “with thankfulness.”\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nGod’s Garden\n, by Sam Lawlor\nOpen PDF"

But Jesse Gause did not serve faithfully, so Frederick G. Williams was called to replace him. Brother Williams’s name replaced Brother Gause’s name in the revelation.\nThat may seem like a minor detail, but it implies a significant truth: most revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants are addressed to specific people, but we can always seek ways to apply them to ourselves (see\n1 Nephi 19:23\n). When we read the Lord’s counsel to Frederick G. Williams to “strengthen the feeble knees,” we can think of people we might strengthen (\nDoctrine and Covenants 81:5\n). When we read the Lord’s invitation to members of the United Firm to “bind yourselves by this covenant,” we can think of our own covenants. And we can read His promise, “I … am bound when ye do what I say,” as if He’s speaking to us (\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:10, 15\n). We can do this because, as the Lord declared, “What I say unto one I say unto all” (\nverse 5\n).\nSee “\nNewel K. Whitney and the United Firm\n,” “\nJesse Gause: Counselor to the Prophet\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 142–47, 155–57.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 81:4–5\n;\n82:18–19\n“Thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow beings.”\nIn several passages in\nDoctrine and Covenants 81–83\n, the Lord invites us to help people in need around us. Consider marking the passages as you find them. One of the most descriptive examples is in\nDoctrine and Covenants 81:4–5\n. Here are some questions to help you ponder these verses:\nWhat are some ways a person can be “weak”? What does it mean to “succor” them? When has the Christlike service of others helped me when I felt weak?\nWhat might cause a person’s hands to figuratively “hang down”? How can I “lift up” those hands?\nWhat might “feeble knees” mean? How are they strengthened?\nHow does the Savior do these things for you?\nPerhaps studying this verse has brought to mind someone you could “succor,” “lift up,” or “strengthen.” What will you do to minister to that person?\nWhat else do you learn about service to others in\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:18–19\n? You might also watch the video “Teachings of Thomas S. Monson: Rescuing Those in Need” (Gospel Library). How did Bishop Monson’s ward members exemplify what these verses teach?\nTeachings of Thomas S. Monson: Rescuing Those in Need\nSee also\nJacob 2:17–19\n;\nMosiah 18:8–9\n; “Works of God” (video), ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nWorks of God\nCarl Heinrich Bloch (1834–1890),\nChrist Healing the Sick at Bethesda\n, 1883, oil on canvas, 100 ¾ x 125 ½ inches. Brigham Young University Museum of Art, purchased with funds provided by Jack R. and Mary Lois Wheatley, 2001.\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:3\nThe Savior has given me much and requires much of me.\nReading this verse might prompt you to review what God has given you—both physical and spiritual blessings. Keep this in mind as you read the rest of\nsection 82\n. What do you feel God requires of you?\nSee also “\nBecause I Have Been Given Much\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 219.\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:8–10\nCommandments are evidence of God’s love for us.\nIf you or someone you know has ever wondered why the Lord gives so many commandments,\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:8–10\ncould help. Which insights from these verses could help you explain to someone why you choose to follow the Lord’s commandments? What could you compare the commandments to that might help? You could find additional insights in\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:37–38\n;\n130:20–21\nand the video “Blessed and Happy Are Those Who Keep the Commandments of God” (Gospel Library). What experiences have taught you to see commandments as blessings?\nBlessed and Happy Are Those Who Keep the Commandments of God\nThink about some of the commandments God has given you. What have these commandments taught you about Him and His will? (see\nverse 8\n). How has your life been affected by keeping these commandments?\nWhat do you learn about the Lord from\nverse 10\n? What do you think it means for the Lord to be “bound”? (see also\nverse 15\n).\nHow has the Lord kept His promises in your life? What might you say to someone who doesn’t feel motivated to keep the commandments because they haven’t received the blessings they hoped for? Do you find any helpful insights in Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nOur Relationship with God\n”? (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 78–80).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nCommandments\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:10\nThe Lord blesses us in His own marvelous ways.\nSister Virginia H. Pearce, former member of the Young Women General Presidency, spoke about a woman who worried desperately about her children who were making unrighteous choices. In a near panic, she tried everything she could think of to seek the Lord’s blessings on their behalf. In addition to fervent prayer, she set an ambitious goal of increased temple attendance and felt sure that the Lord would honor this significant sacrifice by changing her children’s hearts. The woman reported:\n“After ten years of increased temple attendance and constant prayer, I am sorry to say that my children’s choices have not changed. …\n“But I have. I am a different woman. … I have a softer heart. I am filled with compassion. I can actually do more and am free of fear, anxiety, guilt, blame, and dread. I have given up my time limits and am able to wait on the Lord. And I experience frequent manifestations of the Lord’s power. He sends tender mercies, small messages that acknowledge his love for me and my children. My expectations have changed. Instead of expecting my children to change, I expect these frequent tender mercies and am full of gratitude for them. …\n“My prayers are changed. I express more love and am more thankful. … The Lord works in marvelous ways, and I truly am filled with the peace that passeth all understanding” (in “\nPrayer: A Small and Simple Thing\n,”\nAt the Pulpit\n[2017], 288–89).\nDoctrine and Covenants 83\n“Widows and orphans shall be provided for.”\nIn April 1832, as instructed by the Lord, Joseph Smith traveled nearly 800 miles to visit the Saints who had gathered in Missouri (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 78:9\n). While he was there, he visited a community where several widows were raising their children alone. Among them were Phebe Peck and Anna Rogers, whom the Prophet knew personally. In Missouri in the 1830s, state laws gave widows limited rights to their deceased husbands’ property. What do you learn from\nsection 83\nabout how the Lord feels about widows and orphans? Do you know anyone in this situation who would benefit from your love or care? What are some ways you can share what you have with widows, orphans, single mothers, and others in need?\nSee also\nIsaiah 1:17\n;\nJames 1:27\n.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Jesse Gause\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Frederick G. Williams\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 81:3\nI can pray to God “vocally and in [my] heart.”\nAs you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 81:3\nwith your children, help them think of different “public” and “private” places where they can pray. You might also listen to or sing with them a hymn about prayer, such as “\nSecret Prayer\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 144). Share with each other something from the hymn that teaches an important truth about prayer. You could also talk about speaking reverently to Heavenly Father.\nTo encourage your children to pray in their hearts, you could give them paper hearts and invite them to draw or write something they want to pray about to Heavenly Father.

What is the Lord asking us to do in this verse? You might share with each other some ways that people have strengthened you when you felt “weak” or “feeble.” The video “Pass It On” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n) could give your children ideas about how they serve others.

Instead of simply telling your children how they can serve others, for example, encourage them to seek the Lord’s guidance to know who they can help.\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:10\nHeavenly Father promises blessings as I strive to obey Him.\nYou and your children could look in\nDoctrine and Covenants 82:8–10\nfor answers to the question “Why does Heavenly Father give us commandments?” You might want to help your children think of examples of His commandments (see, for example,\nExodus 20:4–17\n;\nMatthew 22:37–39\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:5–17\n). It might help if you and your children find or draw pictures to represent some of them. How do Heavenly Father’s commandments show His love for us?\nPerhaps a simple game would help your children see God’s commandments as blessings, not burdens.

They were baptized, confirmed, and called to serve by priesthood authority, much like we are today. But having access to priesthood power is not the same thing as completely understanding it, and God had more He wanted His Saints to understand—particularly with the coming restoration of temple ordinances. The 1832 revelation on the priesthood, now\nDoctrine and Covenants 84\n, expanded the Saints’ vision of what the priesthood really is. And it can do the same for us today. After all, there is a lot to learn about the divine power that holds “the key of the knowledge of God,” that makes manifest “the power of godliness,” and that prepares us to “see the face of God, even the Father, and live” (\nverses 19–22\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:17–32\nI have access to God’s priesthood power and blessings.\nWhen you think of the word\npriesthood\n, what comes to mind? How does God’s priesthood power influence your life?\nAfter pondering these questions, you might study\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:17–32\n, looking for what God wants you to know about His priesthood power. Consider how you could use these verses to describe the priesthood and its purposes to someone.\nOne thing you’ll find is that through priesthood ordinances “the power of godliness is manifest” (see\nverses 19–21\n). Perhaps you could list the priesthood ordinances you have participated in (the lists in\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n18.1\n,\n18.2\n, can help). How have these ordinances—and the associated covenants—brought God’s power into your life? What would your life be like without them?\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught: “Every woman and every man who makes covenants with God and keeps those covenants, and who participates worthily in priesthood ordinances, has direct access to the power of God” (“\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 77). Consider studying President Nelson’s message, looking for ways you can “draw the Savior’s power into [your] life.”\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:10, 13, 15\n;\n121:34–37, 41–46\n; Topics and Questions, “\nPriesthood\n,” “\nJoseph Smith’s Teachings about Priesthood, Temples, and Women\n,” Gospel Library;\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.6\n, Gospel Library.\nLive Up to Your Privileges\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:31–44\nThe priesthood is obtained with an oath and covenant.\nThe oath and covenant of the priesthood (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:31–44\n) has special application for Heavenly Father’s sons who are ordained to a priesthood office, but many of the promised blessings in these verses are available to all of God’s children. What are these promises, and what does God ask us to do to receive them?\nElder Paul B. Pieper taught: “It is interesting that in the oath and covenant of the priesthood [see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:31–44\n], the Lord uses the verbs\nobtain\nand\nreceive\n.

But on December 25, 1832, Joseph Smith’s mind was occupied with the threat of war. The state of South Carolina in the United States had just defied the government and was preparing for battle. And the Lord revealed that this was only the beginning: “War,” He declared, “will be poured out upon all nations” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 87:2\n). It seemed like this prophecy would be fulfilled very soon.\nBut then it wasn’t. Within a few weeks, South Carolina and the United States government reached a compromise, and war was averted. Prophecy, however, is not always fulfilled at the time or in the way we expect. Nearly 30 years later, long after Joseph Smith was martyred, South Carolina rebelled and civil war followed. Today, war throughout the world continues to cause “the earth [to] mourn” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 87:6\n). The value of this revelation is less in predicting when calamity will come and more in teaching what to do when it comes. The counsel is the same in 1831, 1861, and 2025: “Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved” (\nverse 8\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 85:1–2\nThe Lord wants me “to keep a history.”\nNotice what the Lord wanted to be included in the “history” described in\nDoctrine and Covenants 85:1–2\n.

        "Just days after warning that war would be “poured out upon all nations” ( Doctrine and Covenants 87:2 ), the Lord gave a revelation that Joseph Smith called an “olive leaf,” which is a traditional symbol of peace ( Doctrine and Covenants 88 , section heading; see also Genesis 8:11 ). Throughout your study of section 88 this week, look for the Lord’s messages of peace to you.",
        "The words light and law are repeated many times in section 88 . Mark or note verses where you find these words in verses 6–67 , and write down what you learn about light and law—and about Jesus Christ. What do you feel inspired to do to receive light and live the “law of Christ”? ( verse 21 ).",
        "See also Isaiah 60:19 ; John 1:1–9 ; 3 Nephi 15:9 ; Timothy J. Dyches, “ Light Cleaveth unto Light ,” Liahona , May 2021, 112–15; Sharon Eubank, “ Christ: The Light That Shines in Darkness ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 73–76.",
        "What experiences have shown you that the promises in these verses are true? What is your next step to “draw near unto” Christ? Consider making the hymn “ Nearer, My God, to Thee ” ( Hymns , no. 100) part of your study and worship.",
        "The Lord’s command to “sanctify yourselves” appears twice in section 88 ( verses 68, 74 ). What do you think this phrase means? You might review some of the passages under “ Sanctification ” in the Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library). How do we become sanctified? Let this question guide your study of Doctrine and Covenants 88:67–76 , and record any spiritual insights you gain.",
        "The Lord told the Saints to establish a “school of the prophets” in Kirtland ( Doctrine and Covenants 88:137 ). Much of the instruction in section 88 taught them how to do it. This instruction could also help you “establish … a house of learning” ( verse 119 ) in your own life. In fact, you could look at verses 77–80 and 118–26 as blueprints to “remodel your home [or your life] into a center of gospel learning” and “a sanctuary of faith” (Russell M. Nelson, “ Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 113).

Even if we can’t comprehend it all, we can at least sense that there’s far more to eternity than we ever realized. Of course, the Lord doesn’t share these grand truths to intimidate us or make us feel small. In fact, He promised, “The day shall come when you\nshall\ncomprehend even God” (\nverse 49\n; emphasis added). Perhaps it was to that glorious end that the Lord commanded His Saints in Kirtland to form the School of the Prophets. “Organize yourselves,” He said. “Prepare every needful thing; and establish … a house of God” (\nverse 119\n). More than anywhere else, it is within God’s holy house—and in our homes—that He can lift our vision beyond the mortal world, “unveil his face unto [us],” and prepare us to “abide a celestial glory” (\nverses 68, 22\n).\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:164–66\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 88\nJesus Christ offers me peace.\nJust days after warning that war would be “poured out upon all nations” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 87:2\n), the Lord gave a revelation that Joseph Smith called an “olive leaf,” which is a traditional symbol of peace (\nDoctrine and Covenants 88\n, section heading; see also\nGenesis 8:11\n).

They discussed spiritual truths, prayed together, fasted, and prepared to preach the gospel. But there was something about the atmosphere that might seem odd to us today, and it didn’t seem right to Emma Smith either. During the meetings, the men smoked and chewed tobacco, which wasn’t unusual for the time, but it stained the wood floors black and left a strong odor in the air. Emma shared her concerns with Joseph, and Joseph asked the Lord. His response was a revelation that went far beyond smoke and tobacco stains. It gave the Saints, for generations to come, “a principle with promise”—promises of physical health, “wisdom,” and “great treasures of knowledge” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:3, 19\n).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:166–68\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 89\nThe Lord gave me the Word of Wisdom to help me be healthy in body and spirit.\nWhen the elders in the School of the Prophets first heard Joseph Smith read the Word of Wisdom, they immediately “tossed their pipes and plugs of chewing tobacco into the fire” (\nSaints\n,\n1:168\n). They wanted to show their willingness to obey the Lord. Perhaps you have already “tossed” from your life the substances the Word of Wisdom warns against, but what else can you learn from this revelation? Consider these ideas:\nThink of the revelation as “a principle with promise” (\nverse 3\n)—enduring truths that guide decision-making. What principles do you find that can guide your decisions? What blessings does the Lord promise? (see\nverses 18–21\n). How has He fulfilled those promises in your life?\nWhat examples have you seen of “evils and designs … in the hearts of conspiring men” related to the Word of Wisdom? (\nverse 4\n). In addition to this revelation, what has the Lord given to help you avoid or overcome these evils?\nWhat does this revelation teach you about the Lord? How does the Word of Wisdom relate to\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:34–35\n?\nWhat are you prompted to do to better care for your body?\nYou may have had opportunities to explain to others why you live the Word of Wisdom—and you may have more opportunities in the future. Consider how you might use these opportunities to testify of the Savior, the sacredness of our bodies, and other spiritual truths. For ideas, see “\nYour body is sacred\n,”\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 22–29.\nSee also\n1 Corinthians 6:19–20\n; Thomas S.

If you are still waiting for certain blessings, ponder what you can do to remain faithful as you wait to see how “all things shall work together for your good.”\nAll Things for Our Good\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:28–31\nWho was Vienna Jaques?\nVienna Jaques was born on June 10, 1787, in Massachusetts. A woman of faith who had considerable financial means, Vienna first met missionaries in 1831. After obtaining a spiritual witness that their message was true, she traveled to meet the Prophet in Kirtland, Ohio, where she was baptized.\nVienna obeyed the Lord’s counsel to her in\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:28–31\n. Her consecration to the Lord, which included donations she had made earlier in Kirtland, came at a crucial time for the Church, when leaders were trying to purchase the land where the Kirtland Temple would be built. Vienna was “faithful, and not … idle” throughout her life and was eventually able to “settle down in peace” (\nverse 31\n) in the Salt Lake Valley, where she died at age 96.\nDoctrine and Covenants 91\n“The Spirit manifesteth truth.”\nWe all encounter messages that contain “many things … that are true” and “many things … that are not true” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 91:1–2\n). What counsel do you find in\nsection 91\nthat can help you discern truth in the messages you encounter? How has the Spirit helped you discern truth from error?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nSidney Rigdon\nN. K. Whitney Store\nWord of Wisdom (D&C 89)\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 89\nThe Word of Wisdom helps me be healthy in body and spirit.\nTo introduce\nsection 89\n, perhaps you and your children could look at a picture of a temple or sing a song about physical health, such as “\nThe Lord Gave Me a Temple\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 153), to teach that our bodies are like temples for our spirits. Help your children act out ways they can care for their bodies.\nTo learn about the Lord’s commandments in\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:10–17\n, you and your children could draw or look at pictures of good things we can eat or do to keep our bodies healthy (see the picture and\nactivity page\nat the end of this outline). What has the Lord warned us not to use? Why does He want us to care for our bodies?\nThe Word of Wisdom: The Lord's law of health\nElder Gary E. Stevenson counseled young people to plan in advance what they will do when tempted with alcohol or drugs. He taught: “You will find that temptation has less control over you. You will have already made the decision of how you will react and what you will do. You won’t need to decide every time” (“\nYour Priesthood Playbook\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 48). After reading together\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:4\nand Elder Stevenson’s statement, counsel with your children about how they can decide now—for the rest of their lives—to live the Word of Wisdom. You could even role-play how they might respond if someone, even a friend, offers them something that is against the Word of Wisdom. How does the Lord bless us as we obey the Word of Wisdom? (\nsee verses 18–21\n).\nOur bodies are gifts from God.\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:5\nGod gives me prophets to guide and protect me.\nYou could look at pictures of ancient prophets or sing a song like “\nFollow the Prophet\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 110–11). How has God blessed His children through His prophets? Why should we listen to God’s prophets? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 90:5\n). Then you and your children could look at a picture of the living prophet and share some things the Lord has taught or warned us about through him. How can we follow the prophet?\nDoctrine and Covenants 91\nThe Spirit can help me know what is true.\nYou could summarize the section heading for\nDoctrine and Covenants 91\nto help your children understand why this revelation was given. They could then think of places, such as in the media, where we find “many things … that are true” and “many things … that are not true” (\nverses 1–2\n). What do\nverses 4–6\nteach us about the Holy Ghost? How does the Holy Ghost help us know what is right?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n“All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine.”\nOpen PDF"

Whatever limitations we may see in ourselves, Heavenly Father and His Son see something glorious in us, something godlike. Just as Jesus Christ “was in the beginning with the Father,” so “ye were also” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:21, 23\n). Just as He “continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness,” so also “you shall receive grace for grace” (\nverses 13, 20\n). The restored gospel teaches about the true nature of God, and so it also teaches about your true nature and destiny. You are a literal child of God with the potential to “in due time receive of his fulness” (\nverse 19\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 93\nLike Jesus Christ, I can be glorified and receive God’s “fulness.”\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith taught, “If men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves” (\nTeachings: Joseph Smith\n,\n40\n). As you learn about the Savior by studying\nDoctrine and Covenants 93\n, look for what you also learn about yourself. For example, what do you learn about Him from\nverses 3, 12–13, 21, and 26\n? What similar truths do you find about yourself in\nverses 20, 23, and 28–29\n? (see also\n1 John 3:2\n;\n3 Nephi 27:27\n). The following questions may help you understand and apply the truths in this section:\nWhat do you feel it means to receive “grace for grace” and to continue “from grace to grace”? (\nverses 12–13\n). If it helps, you could read “\nGrace\n” in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).\nWhat do you discover in this revelation about how God helps you grow and learn? How does knowing this affect the way you treat others—and yourself?\nWhat do you learn about “how to worship, and … what you worship”? (\nverse 19\n; see also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nWorship\n,” Gospel Library).\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:1–39\nThe glory of God is light and truth.\nYou might notice that words like\nglory\n,\nlight\n, and\ntruth\nappear frequently in this revelation. As you study\nverses 20–39\nin particular, list the truths you learn about these concepts. Making a table like this one might help:\nVerse\nWhat I learn\nQuestions to ponder\nVerse\n24\nWhat I learn\nQuestions to ponder\nThere are many deceptions in the world. How can I know the truth? (see also\nJacob 4:13\n).\nVerse\n28\nWhat I learn\nQuestions to ponder\nVerse\n36\nWhat I learn\nGod is a being of light and truth.\nQuestions to ponder\nVerse\n37\nWhat I learn\nQuestions to ponder\nWho do I know that seems to be able to resist evil influences? Why are they able to do this?\nVerse\nWhat I learn\nQuestions to ponder\nVerse\nWhat I learn\nQuestions to ponder\nVerse\nSee also:\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:24\nWhat I learn\nQuestions to ponder\nWhat do you find in these verses that inspires you to seek greater light and truth? Why are\nlight\nand\ntruth\ngood titles for Jesus Christ? (see\nJohn 8:12\n;\n14:6\n). How do these truths affect your life?\nYou might also make note of promises about your eternal destiny in\nverses 20, 22, 28, 33–35\n. What is the relationship between these promises and obtaining light?\nConsider searching “\nWalk in God’s light\n” (\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 18–21) to find out what you can do to obtain light and how the Lord promises to bless you. The videos “Light and Truth, Part 1” and “Part 2” (Gospel Library) may provide additional ideas.\nSee also “\nTeach Me to Walk in the Light\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 304; Topics and Questions, “\nHoly Ghost\n,” Gospel Library.\nLight and Truth, Part 1\nLight and Truth, Part 2\n“The glory of God is … light and truth.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:40–50\n“Set in order your own house.”\nThe command to “set in order your own house” (\nverse 43\n) isn’t about organizing cupboards and closets but about teaching—and learning—“light and truth” (\nverse 42\n). Consider how you are trying to follow this counsel. What challenges do you face? Which truths in\nDoctrine and Covenants 93\ncan help?\nWhat insights do you gain from these teachings by Elder David A. Bednar?\n“In my office is a beautiful painting of a wheat field. The painting is a vast collection of individual brushstrokes—none of which in isolation is very interesting or impressive. In fact, if you stand close to the canvas, all you can see is a mass of seemingly unrelated and unattractive streaks of yellow and gold and brown paint. However, as you gradually move away from the canvas, all of the individual brushstrokes combine together and produce a magnificent landscape of a wheat field. Many ordinary, individual brushstrokes work together to create a captivating and beautiful painting.\n“Each family prayer, each episode of family scripture study, and each family home evening is a brushstroke on the canvas of our souls. No one event may appear to be very impressive or memorable. But just as the yellow and gold and brown strokes of paint complement each other and produce an impressive masterpiece, so our consistency in doing seemingly small things can lead to significant spiritual results. ‘Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great’ [\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:33\n]. Consistency is a key principle as we lay the foundation of a great work in our individual lives and as we become more diligent and concerned in our own homes” (“\nMore Diligent and Concerned at Home\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2009, 19–20).\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “\nA Home Where the Spirit of the Lord Dwells\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 22–25.\nThe Lord commands parents to “bring up [their] children in light and truth.”\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nJoseph Smith Jr.\nN. K. Whitney Store\n‘Man Was Also in the Beginning with God’\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:2–21\nJesus Christ is the Light and Life of the World.\nConsider showing a picture of the Savior and asking your children why it is important to learn about and follow Jesus Christ. Then you could read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:19\nto discover one important reason.\nYou may want to choose several truths about Christ in\nsection 93\nthat are inspiring to you and help your children discover and understand them (see also “\nChapter 33: A Revelation about Jesus Christ\n,” in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 126–27, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). For each truth you choose, you could give your children a word or phrase to listen for as you read the verse together. For example, Jesus Christ:\nDid the works of the Father (\nverse 5\n).\nIs the Light of the World (\nverse 9\n).\nIs the Creator of the world (\nverse 10\n).\nReceived all power in heaven and on earth (\nverse 17\n).\nWas with God in the beginning (\nverse 21\n).\nChapter 33: A Revelation about Jesus Christ: May 1833\nDetail from\nLight of the World\n, by Howard Lyon\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:23, 29, 38\nI lived with Heavenly Father before I came to earth.\nThe Savior emphasized three times in\nsection 93\nthat we lived with God “in the beginning” (\nverses 23, 29, 38\n). To help your children discover this, you could invite them to read\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:23, 29, 38\nand look for a truth about themselves that is repeated in these verses. Why does Heavenly Father want us to know this truth? You might also ask your children what they know about our life with Heavenly Father before we were born. To help them learn more, read with them one or more of the following scripture passages:\nJeremiah 1:5\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:53–56\n;\nMoses 3:5\n;\nAbraham 3:22–26\n.\nYou could also sing together “\nI Am a Child of God\n” or “\nI Lived in Heaven\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 2–3, 4) and discuss truths we learn from these songs about our purpose for coming to earth.\nDoctrine and Covenants 93:24–39\nI receive light and truth as I obey God.\nTo help your children apply the truths about obedience in\nDoctrine and Covenants 93\n, consider writing a few scripture references from this section on pieces of paper. On different pieces of paper, write the truths that each of these verses teaches. Your children could work together to read the verses and match the truths to the scripture references. Examples could include:\nVerse 24\n: Truth is knowing things that are real in the past, present, and future.\nVerse 28\n: I can receive light and truth as I keep the commandments.\nVerse 37\n: When I have light and truth, I am able to resist evil.\nVerse 39\n: I lose light and truth when I am disobedient.\nYou may want to share examples of truths you have come to know as you have kept the commandments of the Lord.\nAdapt to the ages of your children.\nYou know the needs and abilities of your children; feel free to adapt the activity ideas to meet their needs. For example, in this activity, if you are teaching young children, it may be better to focus on one simple truth from\nsection 93\n.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nLight and Truth\n, by Simon Dewey"

The tabernacle was to be the center of Israel’s wilderness camp (see\nNumbers 2:1–2\n).\nIn 1833, the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to build temples “not after the manner of the world” but rather “after the manner which I shall show” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:13–14\n; see also\n97:10\n). Like the tabernacle in the wilderness, the temple was meant to be a central feature in Kirtland (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 94:1\n).\nToday, temples are found around the world. Even if they aren’t at the center of our cities, they point us to Christ, who should be the center of our lives. Though each temple differs in appearance, within them we learn the same divine pattern—a heavenly plan to bring us back into the presence of God. Sacred ordinances and covenants connect us to Christ and strengthen our families “not after the manner of the world” but after the pattern God shows us.\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:169–70\n; “\nA House for Our God\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 165–73.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 94\n;\n97:10–17\nI can be “wholly dedicated unto the Lord.”\nIn\nDoctrine and Covenants 94\n, the Lord gives instructions about constructing administrative buildings in Kirtland—an office and a printing house. What impresses you about what the Lord says about these buildings in\nDoctrine and Covenants 94:2–12\n? How does it compare with what He says about the temple in\n97:10–17\n?\nWhat does it mean to you to be “wholly dedicated unto the Lord”?\nDoctrine and Covenants 95\nThe Lord chastens those He loves.\nWhen the revelation in\nsection 95\nwas received, about five months had passed since the Lord commanded the Saints to build a house of God (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 88:117–19\n)—and they hadn’t started yet. Notice how the Lord corrected them in this revelation. You might even make a list of principles you find for giving inspired correction. What do you learn about the Lord from the way He corrected His Saints?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:43–44\n; D. Todd Christofferson, “\nAs Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2011, 97–100.\nGod Loves His Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8, 11–17\n;\n97:10–17\nThe temple is the house of the Lord.\nAfter being chastised for not building a house of the Lord in Kirtland, Church leaders chose a site in a wheat field where they would build. Hyrum Smith, the Prophet’s brother, immediately ran to get a scythe to begin clearing the field. “We are preparing to build a house for the Lord,” he said, “and I am determined to be the first at the work” (in\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith\n[2007],\n271, 273\n). Why do you think Hyrum was so eager to build the temple? Ponder this as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8, 11–17\n;\n97:10–17\n.\nIn our day, the Lord “is accelerating the pace at which we are building temples” (Russell M. Nelson, “\nFocus on the Temple\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 121). If someone asked you why the Church of Jesus Christ builds so many temples, what would you say? Look for possible answers in:\nPresident Russell M.

How can you show the same sense of urgency that Hyrum Smith felt toward the Lord’s holy house? For example, what could you do that would be like clearing the field, as Hyrum did?

How is that similar to or different from what\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:8–9\nteaches about what it means to be accepted of the Lord? What do you think the Lord is trying to teach you with the metaphor in\nverse 9\n?\nSee also Erich W. Kopischke, “\nBeing Accepted of the Lord\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2013, 104–6.\nCreate a spiritual environment for learning and teaching.\n“The Holy Ghost,” Jesus promised, “shall teach you all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n). So whether you’re learning on your own or with others, make it a priority to invite the Spirit. Sacred music, prayer, and loving interactions can all help create a peaceful, spiritual setting where the Holy Ghost can teach you truth.\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:18–28\nZion is “the pure in heart.”\nTo the Saints in the 1830s, Zion was a place. In the revelation in\nsection 97\n, the Lord expanded the definition to describe a people—“the pure in heart” (\nverse 21\n).

Christensen, 1970.\nSeptember 8–14: “Be Still and Know That I Am God”\nDoctrine and Covenants 98–101\nFor the Saints in the 1830s, Independence, Missouri, was literally the promised land. It was “the center place” of Zion (\nDoctrine and Covenants 57:3\n)—the city of God on earth—and the gathering of Saints there was an exciting prelude to the Second Coming. But their neighbors in the area saw things differently. They objected to the claim that God had given the land to the Saints, and they were uncomfortable with the political, economic, and social consequences of so many unfamiliar people moving in so quickly. Discomfort soon turned into persecution and violence. In 1833, the Church’s printing office was destroyed, and the Saints were forced from their homes.\nJoseph Smith was more than 800 miles away in Kirtland, and this news took weeks to reach him. But the Lord knew what was happening, and He revealed to His Prophet principles of peace and encouragement that would comfort the Saints—principles that can also help us when we face persecution, when our righteous desires go unfulfilled, or when we need a reminder that our daily afflictions will eventually, somehow, “work together for [our] good” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 98:3\n).\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:171–93\n; “\nWaiting for the Word of the Lord\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 196–201.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 98:1–3, 11–14, 22\n;\n101:1–16, 22–31, 36\nMy trials can work together for my good.\nSome of our challenges in life are caused by our own choices. Others are caused by the choices of others. And sometimes things just happen that are part of mortality.

        "Section 102 contains the minutes of the meeting in Kirtland, Ohio, where the first high council of the Church was organized. In verses 12–23 , the Lord describes procedures that high councils follow when holding membership councils for those who have committed serious transgressions.",
        "President M. Russell Ballard taught: “Members sometimes ask why Church [membership] councils are held. The purpose is threefold: to save the soul of the transgressor, to protect the innocent, and to safeguard the Church’s purity, integrity, and good name” (“ A Chance to Start Over: Church Disciplinary Councils and the Restoration of Blessings ,” Ensign , Sept. 1990, 15).",
        "See also Topics and Questions, “ Membership Councils ,” Gospel Library.",
        "Why did the Saints lose their promised land in Missouri? There may have been many reasons—at least one, the Lord said, was “the transgressions of my people.” If not for that, Zion “might have been redeemed” ( Doctrine and Covenants 105:2 ). As you read Doctrine and Covenants 103:1–12, 36 ; 105:1–19 , you may notice some things that hindered the establishment of Zion in Missouri and others that could have helped. What do you learn that can help you establish Zion in your heart, home, and community?",
        "In many ways, participating in Zion’s Camp was a trial of faith. The journey was long, the weather was hot, and food and water were sometimes scarce. And after all they endured, Zion’s Camp was still unsuccessful in returning the Saints to their land. Imagine you had the opportunity to write a letter to a member of Zion’s Camp whose faith in the Lord was shaken by his or her experience. What might you say to encourage this person? What truths do you find in Doctrine and Covenants 103:5–7, 12–13, 36 ; 105:1–6, 9–19 that could help?",
        "Then you might think about a more modern example of a trial like Zion’s Camp—such as a missionary who works hard, but no one joins the Church because of his or her efforts. Based on what you’ve studied, how would you help that missionary see that his or her mission was still successful?",
        "How has the Lord blessed you “after much tribulation”? ( Doctrine and Covenants 103:12 ).",
        "See also 1 Nephi 11:16–17 ; Alma 7:11–12 ; Doctrine and Covenants 6:33–36 ; 84:88 ; 101:35–36 ; David A. Bednar, “ On the Lord’s Side: Lessons from Zion’s Camp ,” Ensign , July 2017, 26–35, or Liahona , July 2017, 14–23; Topics and Questions, “ Endure to the End ,” Gospel Library; “ How Firm a Foundation ,” Hymns , no. 85.",
        "Consider Elder Orson F. Whitney’s counsel about the purpose of trials: “No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God … and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven” (in Spencer W.

Christensen (1831–1912),\nZion’s Camp\n, c. 1878, tempera on muslin, 78 x 114 inches. Brigham Young University Museum of Art, gift of the grandchildren of C.C.A. Christensen, 1970.\nSeptember 15–21: “After Much Tribulation … Cometh the Blessing”\nDoctrine and Covenants 102–105\nThe Saints in Kirtland were heartbroken to hear that their brothers and sisters in Jackson County, Missouri, were being driven from their homes. It must have been encouraging, then, when the Lord declared that “the redemption of Zion” would “come by power” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 103:15\n). With that promise in their hearts, over 200 men and about 25 women and children enlisted in what they called the Camp of Israel, later known as Zion’s Camp. Its mission was to march to Missouri and redeem Zion.\nTo the members of the camp, redeeming Zion meant restoring the Saints to their land. But just before they arrived in Jackson County, the Lord told Joseph Smith to disband Zion’s Camp. Some members of the camp were confused and upset; it seemed the expedition had failed and the Lord’s promises were not fulfilled. Others, however, saw it differently. While the exiled Saints did not get their lands and homes back, the experience did bring a degree of “redemption” to Zion, and it did “come by power.” Faithful members of Zion’s Camp, many of whom later became leaders of the Church, testified that the experience deepened their faith in God’s power, in Joseph Smith’s divine call, and in Zion—not just Zion the place but Zion the people of God. Rather than questioning the value of this seemingly unsuccessful task, they learned that the real task is to follow the Savior, even when we don’t understand everything. This is how Zion, ultimately, will be redeemed.\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:194–206\n; “\nThe Acceptable Offering of Zion’s Camp\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 213–18.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 102:12–23\nWhat is the purpose of membership councils?\nSection 102\ncontains the minutes of the meeting in Kirtland, Ohio, where the first high council of the Church was organized. In\nverses 12–23\n, the Lord describes procedures that high councils follow when holding membership councils for those who have committed serious transgressions.\nPresident M. Russell Ballard taught: “Members sometimes ask why Church [membership] councils are held. The purpose is threefold: to save the soul of the transgressor, to protect the innocent, and to safeguard the Church’s purity, integrity, and good name” (“\nA Chance to Start Over: Church Disciplinary Councils and the Restoration of Blessings\n,”\nEnsign\n, Sept. 1990, 15).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nMembership Councils\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 103:1–12, 36\n;\n105:1–19\nZion can be built only on principles of righteousness.\nWhy did the Saints lose their promised land in Missouri? There may have been many reasons—at least one, the Lord said, was “the transgressions of my people.” If not for that, Zion “might have been redeemed” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 105:2\n). As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 103:1–12, 36\n;\n105:1–19\n, you may notice some things that hindered the establishment of Zion in Missouri and others that could have helped. What do you learn that can help you establish Zion in your heart, home, and community?\nDoctrine and Covenants 103:12–13, 36\n;\n105:1–6, 9–19\nBlessings come after trials of faith.\nIn many ways, participating in Zion’s Camp was a trial of faith. The journey was long, the weather was hot, and food and water were sometimes scarce. And after all they endured, Zion’s Camp was still unsuccessful in returning the Saints to their land. Imagine you had the opportunity to write a letter to a member of Zion’s Camp whose faith in the Lord was shaken by his or her experience. What might you say to encourage this person? What truths do you find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 103:5–7, 12–13, 36\n;\n105:1–6, 9–19\nthat could help?\nThen you might think about a more modern example of a trial like Zion’s Camp—such as a missionary who works hard, but no one joins the Church because of his or her efforts. Based on what you’ve studied, how would you help that missionary see that his or her mission was still successful?\nHow has the Lord blessed you “after much tribulation”?

Whitney’s counsel about the purpose of trials: “No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God … and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven” (in Spencer W.

Pause periodically to talk about lessons we can learn from Zion’s Camp—for example, that the Lord wants us to be peaceful and work together instead of arguing and fighting (see also Russell M. Nelson, “\nPeacemakers Needed\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 98–101).\nThe Camp of Israel\nYou could also read\nDoctrine and Covenants 105:38–40\nand ask the children to stand up each time they hear the word “peace.” Explain that the Lord wanted the Saints to make peace with the people who were being unkind. Help your children think of things that they can do to be peacemakers, and invite them to role-play some situations.\nZion’s Camp (Zion’s Camp at Fishing River)\n, by Judith A. Mehr\nOpen PDF"

By the time this revelation was published, Church membership was outgrowing the capacity of the few leaders it had in place. Outlining the roles and responsibilities of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Seventy, bishops, and quorum presidencies was definitely needed and helpful. But there’s so much more to the divine instruction in\nsection 107\nthan just how Church leadership should be organized. Here, the Lord teaches us about His power and authority, “the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God” (\nverse 3\n). The purpose of the priesthood is to unlock “all the spiritual blessings of the church” so that all of God’s children can “have the heavens opened unto them” and “enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant” (\nverses 18–19\n). In teaching us about His priesthood, the Savior is teaching us about Himself and how we can come unto Him.\nSee “\nRestoring the Ancient Order\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 208–12.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 106\n;\n108\nThe Lord supports me when He calls me to serve.\nIn\nDoctrine and Covenants 106\nand\n108\n, the Lord gave counsel and promises to two members who were called to serve in His Church. As you study His counsel, you might think about your own opportunities to serve the Lord—perhaps a ministering assignment, a Church calling, responsibilities in your family, or spiritual promptings to do good.\nWhat do you feel the Lord’s message to you is in these revelations? Which phrases seem particularly meaningful to you? Here are a few to consider:\nWhen has the Lord given you “grace [or divine help] and assurance” to be able to serve Him?

Hopkinson\nSeptember 29–October 5: “It Is Thy House, a Place of Thy Holiness”\nDoctrine and Covenants 109–110\nThe doors to the Kirtland Temple weren’t supposed to open until eight o’clock on the morning of March 27, 1836. But Saints who were hoping to attend the dedication services started lining up as early as seven. An overflow location and then a second session were needed to accommodate everyone. And it wasn’t just the living who were eager to be present. Multiple witnesses saw angels inside the temple and even on the roof, during and after the dedication. It really did seem that “the armies of heaven” had come to “sing and [to] shout” with the Latter-day Saints (“\nThe Spirit of God\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 2).\nWhy the great excitement—on both sides of the veil? After centuries, there was a house of the Lord again on the earth. The Lord was fulfilling His promise to endow His Saints “with power from on high” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:32\n). And this, He declared, was only “the beginning of the blessing” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:10\n). The era we now live in—with accelerated temple work and ordinances available to millions of the living and the dead—had its beginning in Kirtland, when “the veil o’er the earth [was] beginning to burst” (“\nThe Spirit of God\n”).\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:232–41\n; “\nA House for Our God\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 169–72.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 109\nThe Lord offers me rich blessings through temple covenants.\nThe Kirtland Temple was different from temples we know today. There were no altars and no baptismal font, for example. But the blessings described in\nsection 109\n, the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple, are also available in the Lord’s house today.

        "Below are the words of Latter-day Saints who were in the Kirtland Temple during its dedication and in other meetings that followed. Many compared their experiences to what the ancient Saints experienced when they were “endued with power from on high” on the day of Pentecost ( Luke 24:49 ; see also Acts 2:1–4 ; Doctrine and Covenants 109:36–37 ).",

What has He done to “order all things for your good” ( verse 11 )? What does the phrase “as fast as ye are able to receive them” teach you about Heavenly Father?",

He met with the Prophet, who received a revelation that helped Thomas put aside his hurt feelings. That revelation is recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 112 .",
        "Keep this context in mind as you study Doctrine and Covenants 112 . What do you find that might have healed Thomas’s hurt feelings? In verses 3–15 and 22 , you could look for answers to questions like these: What is humility? What does it mean for the Lord to lead you “by the hand”? Why do you think being humble helps you receive the Lord’s guidance? You could find additional answers in “ Pattern of Humility ” in Elder Joseph W.

Something similar happened to the Saints in Kirtland. Less than a year after the spiritual outpourings connected with the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, troubles arose. A financial crisis, conflict in the Quorum of the Twelve, and other trials caused some Saints to waver in their faith despite their earlier experiences.\nWe can’t avoid trials, so how can we keep them from threatening our faith and testimony? Maybe part of the answer can be found in the Lord’s counsel in\nDoctrine and Covenants 112\n, given while adversity in Kirtland was swelling. The Lord said, “Purify your hearts before me” (\nverse 28\n), “Rebel not” (\nverse 15\n), “Gird up thy loins for the work” (\nverse 7\n), and “Be thou humble” (\nverse 10\n). As we follow this counsel, the Lord will “lead [us] by the hand” through adversity and into healing and peace (see\nverses 10, 13\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 111\nThe Lord can “order all things for [my] good.”\nBy 1836, the Church had accumulated heavy debts in doing the Lord’s work. Joseph Smith and others worried about these debts and considered ways to pay them (see the section heading to\nDoctrine and Covenants 111\n).\nAs you read\nsection 111\n, consider how the Lord’s words to Joseph may apply to you—and the things you worry about. For example, when have you felt God’s love “notwithstanding your follies” (\nverse 1\n)? How has the Lord helped you find unexpected “treasures” (\nverse 10\n)? What has He done to “order all things for your good” (\nverse 11\n)? What does the phrase “as fast as ye are able to receive them” teach you about Heavenly Father?\nSee also\nMatthew 6:19–21, 33\n; “\nMore Treasures Than One\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 229–34.\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:3–15, 22\nThe Lord will lead me as I humbly seek His will.\nThomas B. Marsh, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was upset that Joseph Smith had, without consulting him, called two members of his quorum to preach the gospel in England. He met with the Prophet, who received a revelation that helped Thomas put aside his hurt feelings. That revelation is recorded in\nDoctrine and Covenants 112\n.\nKeep this context in mind as you study\nDoctrine and Covenants 112\n. What do you find that might have healed Thomas’s hurt feelings? In\nverses 3–15 and 22\n, you could look for answers to questions like these: What is humility? What does it mean for the Lord to lead you “by the hand”? Why do you think being humble helps you receive the Lord’s guidance? You could find additional answers in “\nPattern of Humility\n” in Elder Joseph W. Sitati’s message “\nPatterns of Discipleship\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 87–88).\nThink of someone you know who is humble. What does this person do to show humility? What do you learn from the Savior about being humble? Perhaps you can find pictures of times in His life when He showed humility.\nWhen have you felt guided by the Lord as you humbled yourself?\nSee also Ulisses Soares, “\nBe Meek and Lowly of Heart\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 9–11; “\nThe Faith and Fall of Thomas Marsh\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 54–60; Topics and Questions, “\nHumility\n,” Gospel Library; “\nBe Thou Humble\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 130.\nEngage learners.\nThink about how you can help the people you teach to actively participate in learning the truths in the scriptures. For instance, to help them understand what the Lord said in\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:10\n, you could blindfold someone and carefully lead him or her by the hand around a small obstacle course of chairs or other objects. What can we learn about humility from this demonstration?\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:12–26, 28, 33–34\nThose who are truly converted come to know Jesus Christ.\nThe fact that some Apostles in 1837 turned against the Prophet is a good reminder that regardless of our Church calling or how much we know about the gospel, we must individually make sure we nourish our conversion to Jesus Christ. Perhaps you could read\nDoctrine and Covenants 112:12–26, 28, 33–34\nand look for truths that could help you overcome a trial of faith or become more fully converted to the Lord. You might feel inspired to share what you find to help someone else strengthen their conversion to Christ.\nDoctrine and Covenants 113\nJoseph Smith was “a servant in the hands of Christ.”\nThe prophet Isaiah referred to one of Jesse’s descendants as a “rod” and a “root” (\nIsaiah 11:1, 10\n). In\nsection 113\n, the Lord explained that this descendant, a servant of Christ, would be instrumental in gathering the Lord’s people in the last days (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 113:4, 6\n). This prophecy describes the Prophet Joseph Smith quite well. How might this and other truths in\nsection 113\nhave encouraged the Saints during the turmoil they experienced in Kirtland? What do you find in this revelation that inspires you to stay strong and continue to participate in the work of the Lord today?\nSee also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nJesse\n,” Gospel Library;\n2 Nephi 21:10–12\n;\nJoseph Smith—History 1:40\n.\nIsaiah wrote of a “rod” and “roots” coming out of the “stem of Jesse” (Isaiah 11:1).\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Heber C.

The city was growing rapidly, the land seemed abundant, and nearby was Adam-ondi-Ahman, a place of great spiritual significance in the past and in the future (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 107:53–56\n;\n116\n). Still, it must have been hard for the Saints not to think about what they had lost. Besides being driven from Independence, the center place of Zion, the Saints also had to flee Kirtland, leaving their beloved temple after only two years. And this time it wasn’t just enemies outside the Church causing trouble—many prominent members had turned against Joseph Smith, including four members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\nInstead of focusing on what they lost, the faithful just kept building Zion, this time in Far West. They made plans for a new temple. Four new Apostles were called. They understood that doing God’s work doesn’t mean you never fall; it means you “rise again.” And though you’ll have to make sacrifices, those sacrifices are sacred to God, even “more sacred … than [your] increase” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 117:13\n).\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:296–99\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 115:3–6\nThe name of the Church is important to the Lord.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson said that the Church’s name is “a matter of great importance” (“\nThe Correct Name of the Church\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 87). Think about why this is true as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 115:4–6\n. What does the name of the Church have to do with its work and mission?\nSee also\n3 Nephi 27:1–11\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 115:5–6\nZion and her stakes offer “refuge from the storm.”\nAs you study the powerful imagery in\nDoctrine and Covenants 115:5–6\n, consider the role the Lord wants you, as a member of His Church, to fulfill. For example, what can you do to “arise and shine forth” or “be a standard for the nations”? (\nverse 5\n). What spiritual storms do you notice around you? How do you find “refuge” through gathering? (\nverse 6\n).\nSee also “\nBrightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 335.\nThe Savior’s Church can be a light and a refuge in the storm.\nDoctrine and Covenants 117\nMy sacrifices are sacred to the Lord.\nImagine you were Newel K. Whitney or his wife, Elizabeth, who were experiencing a prosperous life in Kirtland and then asked to leave. What do you find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 117:1–11\nthat might have helped you make this sacrifice? What sacrifices do you make for God? What do these verses teach you about who God is and what He does?\nThe sacrifice asked of Oliver Granger was different from the Whitneys’: the Lord assigned him to stay in Kirtland and settle the Church’s finances. While he represented the Church with integrity, he ultimately wasn’t very successful. Consider how the Lord’s words in\nDoctrine and Covenants 117:12–15\napply to the things He has asked of you.\nSee also “\nFar West and Adam-ondi-Ahman\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 239–40.\nDoctrine and Covenants 119–20\nMy tithing helps build the kingdom of God.\nThe instructions in\nsections 119\nand\n120\nclarify what tithing is: we contribute “one-tenth” of our interest (or income) each year (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 119:4\n). But these revelations do more than give a definition. The Lord told the Saints that tithing would “sanctify the land of Zion.” And without this law, He said, “it shall not be … Zion unto you” (\nverse 6\n). Have you ever thought about tithing in this way? How can paying tithing help make you more sanctified, more prepared for Zion?\nWhat do you learn from these revelations about how the Lord’s servants use tithing funds? What is significant to you about the phrase “by mine own voice unto them” in\nDoctrine and Covenants 120\n?\nElder David A. Bednar has given a helpful description of how tithing is used and the blessings that come from obeying this law in “\nThe Windows of Heaven\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 19–20). The following questions may help as you study his message:\nThe Windows of Heaven\nWho determines how tithing is used after it is paid to the Church?\nWhat is tithing used for?\nWhat blessings come as a result of paying tithing? For example, in what ways does paying tithing strengthen your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\nWhat can you learn from Elder Bednar’s invitation?\nHow can you help others increase their faith in the Lord’s law of tithing?\nSee also\nMalachi 3:8–12\n; “\nThe Tithing of My People\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 250–55.\nHelp others apply what they’re learning.\nEven when a person wants to pay tithing, sometimes they don’t know how. If you’re teaching your family or a class, consider taking some time to explain how to pay tithing, either online or with a Tithing and Other Offerings slip.

This is where Joseph Smith and a few others spent four frigid months during the winter of 1838–39. During this time, Joseph was constantly receiving news about the suffering of the Saints. The peace and optimism felt in Far West had lasted only a few months, and now the Saints were without a home once again, driven into the wilderness in search of yet another place to start over—this time with their Prophet in prison.\nAnd yet, even in that miserable jail, “knowledge from heaven” came “pouring down” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:33\n). Joseph’s question “O God, where art thou?” was answered clearly and powerfully: “Fear not … , for God shall be with you forever and ever” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:1\n;\n122:9\n).\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:323–96\n; “\nWithin the Walls of Liberty Jail\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 256–63.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:1–10, 23–33\n;\n122\nWith God, adversity can “be for [my] good.”\nWhen we or people we love are suffering, it is normal to wonder if God is aware of us.

        "While imprisoned in Liberty, Missouri, Joseph Smith received letters informing him about the perilous situation of the Latter-day Saints who were being driven from the state by the order of the governor. A poignant letter came from his wife Emma. Her words, and Joseph’s letters in response, express both their sufferings and their faith during this difficult time in Church history.",
        "Dear Husband",
        "Having an opportunity to send by a friend, I make an attempt to write, but I shall not attempt to write my feelings altogether, for the situation in which you are, the walls, bars, and bolts, rolling rivers, running streams, rising hills, sinking valleys and spreading prairies that separate us, and the cruel injustice that first cast you into prison and still holds you there, with many other considerations, places my feelings far beyond description.",
        "Was it not for conscious innocence, and the direct interposition of divine mercy, I am very sure I never should have been able to have endured the scenes of suffering that I have passed through … ; but I still live and am yet willing to suffer more if it is the will of kind Heaven that I should for your sake.",
        "We are all well at present, except Fredrick who is quite sick.",
        "Little Alexander who is now in my arms is one of the finest little fellows you ever saw in your life. He is so strong that with the assistance of a chair he will run all round the room. …",
        "No one but God knows the reflections of my mind and the feelings of my heart when I left our house and home, and almost all of everything that we possessed excepting our little Children, and took my journey out of the state of Missouri, leaving you shut up in that lonesome prison. But the recollection is more than human nature ought to bear. …",
        "… I hope there are better days to come to us yet. … [I] am ever yours affectionately.",
        "Emma Smith",
        "Dear—and affectionate—Wife.",
        "Thursday night I sat down just as the sun is going down, as we peek through the grates of this lonesome prison, to write to you, that I may make known to you my situation. It is I believe now about five months and six days since I have been under the grimace of a guard night and day, and within the walls, grates, and screeking iron doors of a lonesome, dark, dirty prison. With emotions known only to God do I write this letter. The contemplations of the mind under these circumstances defies the pen, or tongue, or Angels, to describe, or paint, to the human being who never experienced what we experience. … We lean on the arm of Jehovah, and none else, for our deliverance, and if he doesn’t do it, it will not be done, you may be assured, for there is great thirsting for our blood in this state; not because we are guilty of anything. … My Dear Emma, I think of you and the children continually. … I want to see little Frederick, Joseph, Julia, Alexander, Joana, and old major [the family dog]. … I would gladly walk from here to you barefoot, and bareheaded, and half naked, to see you and think it great pleasure, and never count it toil. … I bear with fortitude all my oppression, so do those that are with me; not one of us have flinched yet. I want you [to] not let [our children] forget me.

Winborg. Copyright 2023\nOctober 27–November 2: “A House unto My Name”\nDoctrine and Covenants 124\nAs difficult as the last six years had been for the Saints, things started to look better in the spring of 1839: The refugee Saints had found compassion among the citizens of Quincy, Illinois. Guards had allowed Joseph Smith and other Church leaders to escape captivity in Missouri. And the Church had just purchased land in Illinois where the Saints could gather again. Yes, it was swampy, mosquito-infested land, but compared to the challenges the Saints had already faced, this probably seemed manageable. So they drained the swamp and drafted a charter for a new city, which they named Nauvoo. It means “beautiful” in Hebrew, though it was more an expression of faith than an accurate description, at least at first. Meanwhile, the Lord was impressing His Prophet with a sense of urgency. He had more truths and ordinances to restore, and He needed a holy temple where He could “crown [His Saints] with honor, immortality, and eternal life” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:55\n). In many ways, these same feelings of faith and urgency are evident in the Lord’s work today.\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:399–427\n; “\nOrganizing the Church in Nauvoo\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 264–71.\nLearn more\nabout the Church historic sites in Illinois.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:2–11\nI can invite others to come unto Christ.\nThe Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith to “make a solemn proclamation of [His] gospel” to “all the kings of the world” (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:2–11\n). If you received this assignment, what would your proclamation say about Jesus Christ and His restored gospel? Also ponder how you can share your witness normally and naturally with people you interact with daily.\nSee also “\nThe Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World\n,” Gospel Library.\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:12–21\nI can be a disciple whom the Lord trusts.\nConsider sharing with others, as the Savior did in\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:12–21\n, the Christlike attributes you see in them. How has He expressed to you His love and trust?\nSee also Richard J. Maynes, “\nEarning the Trust of the Lord and Your Family\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 75–77.\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:22–24, 60–61\nThe Lord wants me to welcome and accept others.\nAs you ponder the Lord’s instruction in\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:22–24, 60–61\n, think about how you can make your home and your ward a place like what the Lord had envisioned for Nauvoo.\nSee also “A Friend to All” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nA Friend to All\nInviting Others to \"Come and Stay\"\nDetail from\nJoseph Smith at the Nauvoo Temple\n, by Gary E. Smith\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:25–45, 55\nWe build temples unto the Lord to receive sacred ordinances.\nWhy do you feel the Lord has “always commanded” His people “to build [temples] unto [His] holy name”? Consider making a list of reasons you find in\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:25–45, 55\n. You might find others in a hymn like “\nWe Love Thy House, O God\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 247) or the video “What Is a Temple?” (Gospel Library). How is the work of building temples a sign of the Lord’s love for you?\nWhat Is a Temple?\nSince the Nauvoo Temple was built in the 1840s, over 300 temples have been built or announced. President Russell M. Nelson taught: “We know that our time in the temple is crucial to our salvation and exaltation and to that of our families. … The assaults of the adversary are increasing exponentially, in intensity and in variety. Our need to be in the temple on a regular basis has never been greater” (“\nBecoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 114). How has the temple helped you withstand “the assaults of the adversary”? What do you feel impressed to do to follow President Nelson’s counsel?\nSee also “\nWhy Latter-day Saints Build Temples\n,”\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:45–55\nThe Lord blesses people who strive to obey His commandments.\nThe Saints had been commanded to build a temple in Jackson County, Missouri, but were “hindered by their enemies” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:51\n).\nVerses 49–55\ncontain a reassuring message for people who want to obey God’s commandments but are prevented from doing so because of family or other circumstances. What counsel do you find in these verses that could help someone in such a situation?\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:91–92\nThe Lord can guide me through my patriarchal blessing.\nShortly after the Prophet’s father, Joseph Smith Sr., passed away, the Lord called Hyrum Smith to the calling that his father had held—the Patriarch to the Church. You can read about this in\nDoctrine and Covenants 124:91–92\n.\nTo learn more about the history of patriarchs and patriarchal blessings,\nclick here\n.\nHow would you describe a patriarchal blessing to someone who has never heard of it? What would you say to encourage someone to receive one? Look for answers to these questions in Elder Randall K. Bennett’s message “\nYour Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 42–43) or Topics and Questions, “\nPatriarchal Blessings\n” (Gospel Library).\nBased on what you’ve studied and experienced, consider how you would complete this sentence: “A patriarchal blessing is like\n.” Why does Heavenly Father want His children to receive a patriarchal blessing?\nIf you have not received a patriarchal blessing, what can you do to prepare for one? If you have received a patriarchal blessing, how can you show God that you treasure this gift?\nSee also Kazuhiko Yamashita, “\nWhen to Receive Your Patriarchal Blessing\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 88–90;\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n18.17\n, Gospel Library.\nTeach from the heart.\nTeaching is most meaningful when it includes personal experiences and testimony. For example, if you have received a patriarchal blessing, review it as you prepare to teach about these special blessings. Why are you thankful for your blessing?

We were told by [Joseph Smith], that the same organization existed in the church anciently, allusions to which are made in some of the epistles recorded in the New Testament, making use of the title, ‘elect lady’ [see\n2 John 1:1\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:3\n].\n“This is an organization that cannot exist without the Priesthood, from the fact that it derives all its authority and influence from that source. When the Priesthood was taken from the earth, this institution as well as every other appendage of the true order of the church of Jesus Christ on the earth, became extinct. …\n“Having been present at the organization of the ‘Female Relief Society of Nauvoo,’ … also having had considerable experience in that association, perhaps I may communicate a few hints that will assist the daughters of Zion in stepping forth in this very important position, which is replete with new and multiplied responsibilities. If any of the daughters and mothers in Israel are feeling in the least circumscribed in their present spheres, they will now find ample scope for every power and capability for doing good with which they are most liberally endowed. …\nThe Relief Society was organized in the upstairs room of the Red Brick Store.\n“Should the question arise in the mind, of any, What is the object of the Female Relief Society? I would reply—to do good—to bring into requisition every capacity we possess for doing good, not only in relieving the poor but in saving souls. United effort will accomplish incalculably more than can be accomplished by the most effective individual energies. …\n“In administering to the poor, the Female Relief Society has other duties to perform than merely relieving bodily wants. Poverty of mind and sickness of heart, also demand attention; and many times a kind expression—a few words of counsel, or even a warm and affectionate shake of the hand will do more good and be better appreciated than a purse of gold. …\n“When the Saints gather from abroad, strangers to everybody, and subject to be led astray by those who lie in wait to deceive, the [Relief] Society should be prompt in looking after [them], and introduce them into the society that will refine and elevate, and above all strengthen them in the faith of the Gospel, and in so doing, may be instrumental in saving many.\n“It would require volumes in which to define the duties, privileges and responsibilities that come within the purview of the Society. … Go at it (under the direction of your bishop) coolly, deliberately, energetically, unitedly and prayerfully, and God will crown your efforts with success.”\nNotes\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith\n(2007),\n451\n.\nDaughters in My Kingdom: The History and Work of Relief Society\n(2017),\n7\n.\nJoseph Smith, in Sarah M. Kimball, “Auto-biography,”\nWoman’s Exponent\n, Sept. 1, 1883, 51.\n“Female Relief Society,”\nDeseret News\n, Apr. 22, 1868, 81."

Jane’s own teenage son Cyrus had also recently passed away. Adding to her grief was the fact that Cyrus had never been baptized, and Jane worried what this would mean for his eternal soul. Joseph had wondered the same thing about his beloved brother Alvin, who also died before being baptized. So the Prophet decided to share with everyone at the funeral what the Lord had revealed to him about people who pass away without receiving gospel ordinances—and what we can do to help them.\nThe doctrine of baptism for the dead thrilled the Saints; their thoughts turned immediately to deceased family members. Now there was hope for them! Joseph shared their joy, and in a letter teaching this doctrine, he used joyful, enthusiastic language to express what the Lord taught him about the salvation of the dead: “Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King!” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:23\n).\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:415–27\n; “\nLetters on Baptism for the Dead\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 272–76.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 126\nThe Lord wants me to care for my family.\nAfter returning from a mission to England—one of many missions he served—Brigham Young received another important calling from the Lord. He was asked to “take especial care of [his] family” (\nverse 3\n), who had suffered in his absence. As you study this section, consider why the Lord sometimes requires sacrifice in our service. What can you do to take care of your family?\nSee also “\nTake Special Care of Your Family\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 242–49.\nDoctrine and Covenants 127:2–4\nI can rely on the Lord during difficult times.\nFalse accusations and the threat of arrest had again forced Joseph Smith into hiding in August 1842. And yet the words he wrote to the Saints during this time (now\nDoctrine and Covenants 127\n) are full of optimism and joy. What do\nverses 2–4\nteach you about God? about facing ridicule or opposition? What phrases from these verses might help you when you feel persecuted? Consider recording how the Lord is sustaining you in the “deep water” of your life.\nDoctrine and Covenants 127:5–8\n;\n128:1–8\n“Whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven.”\nAs you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 127:5–8\n;\n128:1–8\n, look for reasons the Lord gave Joseph Smith such specific instructions about recording baptisms for the dead. What does this teach you about the Lord and His work? How do you feel this instruction could apply to your own family records, such as personal journals?\nDoing temple service for our ancestors binds our hearts to them.\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:5–25\nThe salvation of my ancestors is essential to my salvation.\nIt’s clear from what God revealed through Joseph Smith why our ancestors who weren’t baptized in this life need us: we are baptized on their behalf so they can choose to accept or reject this ordinance. But the Prophet also taught that our ancestors’ salvation is “necessary and essential to\nour\nsalvation.” As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:15–18\n, think about why that is.\nVerse 5\nteaches that the ordinance of baptism for the dead was “prepared before the foundation of the world.” What does this truth teach you about God and His plan? What does Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “\nFamily History and Temple Work: Sealing and Healing\n” add to your understanding? (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 46–49).\nJoseph Smith used phrases like “binding power,” “welding link,” and “perfect union” when teaching about priesthood ordinances and baptism for the dead. Look for these and similar phrases as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:5–25\n. Can you think of objects you could use to illustrate these phrases, such as a chain or rope? Why are these good phrases to describe this doctrine?\nConsidering the following questions may also help your study of these verses:\nIn your opinion, why could baptism for the dead be considered the “most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel”? (\nverse 17\n). What experiences have helped you feel this way?\nIn what sense might the earth be cursed if there is no “welding link … between the fathers and the children”? (\nverse 18\n).\nWhat impresses you about Joseph Smith’s words in\nverses 19–25\n? How do these verses affect the way you feel about Jesus Christ? about temple service for your ancestors? (see also “\nCome, Rejoice\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 9).\nWe Without Them Cannot Be Made Perfect\nAfter studying these verses, you may feel inspired to do something for your ancestors. The ideas on\nFamilySearch.org\ncould help.\nThe “\nInspirational Videos\n” in the “\nTemple and Family History\n” collection of the Gospel Library can give you practical help, inspirational stories, and messages from leaders about family history.\nUse related Church resources.\nLinks in\nCome, Follow Me\noutlines provide easy access to helpful resources that can help you understand and apply gospel truths or act on impressions you receive. For example, the FamilySearch link above leads to activities such as building your own family tree, finding ancestors who need temple ordinances, seeing where your ancestors came from, or uploading a family story.\nSee also Kevin R. Duncan, “\nA Voice of Gladness!\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 95–97.\n“A Glorious and Wonderful Provision.”\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley said:\n“Jesus’s Atonement in behalf of all represents a great vicarious sacrifice. He set the pattern under which He became a proxy for all mankind. This pattern under which one man can act in behalf of another is carried forward in the ordinances of the house of the Lord. Here we serve in behalf of those who have died without a knowledge of the gospel. Theirs is the option to accept or reject the ordinance which is performed. They are placed on an equal footing with those who walk the earth. The dead are given the same opportunity as the living. Again, what a glorious and wonderful provision the Almighty has made through His revelation to His Prophet” (“\nThe Great Things Which God Has Revealed\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2005, 82–83).\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Seymour Brunson\nBrigham Young\nBaptism for the Dead\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nDoctrine and Covenants 126:3\nI can help care for my family.\nTo help your children learn to serve their family members, consider sharing the information about Brigham Young in “\nChapter 50: The Saints in Nauvoo\n” (in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 184, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library) or summarize\nDoctrine and Covenants 126\nin your own words. You might emphasize the phrase “take especial care of your family” (\nverse 3\n) and talk with your children about what it means to take special care of our families.\nChapter 50: The Saints in Nauvoo: January–July 1841\nIt may be fun for you and your children to look at family pictures (or draw pictures) as you talk together about ways we can help “care” for family members. You could also sing a song like “\nHome Can Be a Heaven on Earth\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 298).\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:5, 12\nAll of God’s children need the chance to be baptized.\nInvite your children to find out from\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:1\nwhat subject occupied Joseph Smith’s mind. They could also search\nverse 17\nto find out what subject he considered “the most glorious.” Let them share what they find and talk about why this subject is so exciting.\nIn addition to helping your children prepare for (and live) their own baptismal covenants, you can help them know how to help people who did not make these covenants during their lifetime. Consider telling your children about someone you know who died without being baptized. Then you could read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:5\nand look at a picture of a temple baptismal font (like the one at the end of this outline). Tell your children how you feel about being baptized in temples on behalf of people who are dead so that everyone has the chance to make covenants with Heavenly Father.\nSaints Learn about Baptism for the Dead\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\nHeavenly Father wants me to learn about my family history.\nIt might be fun for you and your children to make a paper chain with names of parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on (see this week’s\nactivity page\n). Then you could share with each other what you know about these ancestors. Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\nto find out what the “welding link” is that makes our family history “whole and complete.” You could also watch the video “Courage: I Think I Get It from Him” (Gospel Library).\nCourage: I Think I Get It From Him\nAdditional activities to help your children participate in family history can be found in “\nThe Temple and the Plan of Happiness\n” in appendix B or at\nFamilySearch.org\n.\nTemple ordinances help us unite families like links in a chain.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe baptismal font in the Ogden Utah Temple."

        "Phebe Woodruff was living near Nauvoo when Joseph Smith began teaching about the possibility of being baptized for those who lived previously. She wrote about it to her husband, Wilford, who was serving a mission in England:",
        "“Brother Joseph … has learned by revelation that those in this church may be baptized for any of their relatives who are dead and had not a privilege of hearing this gospel, even for their children, parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, uncles, and aunts. … As soon as they are baptized for their friends they are released from prison and they can claim them in the resurrection and bring them into the celestial kingdom—this doctrine is cordially received by the church and they are going forward in multitudes, some are going to be baptized as many as 16 times … in one day.”",
        "Wilford Woodruff later said of this principle: “The moment I heard of it my soul leaped with joy. … I went forward and was baptised for all my dead relatives I could think of. … I felt to say hallelujah when the revelation came forth revealing to us baptism for the dead. I felt that we had a right to rejoice in the blessings of Heaven.”",
        "Like Sister Woodruff, Vilate Kimball heard about vicarious baptism while her husband, Heber, was away preaching the gospel. She wrote to him:",
        "“President Smith has opened a new and glorious subject … which has caused quite a revival in the church. That is, being baptised for the dead. Paul speaks of it, in first Corinthians 15th chapter 29th verse . Joseph has received a more full explanation of it by Revelation. … It is the privilege of this church to be baptised for all their kinsfolks that have died before this Gospel came forth; even back to their great-Grandfather and Mother. … By so doing, we act as agents for them; and give them the privilege of coming forth in the first resurrection. He says they will have the Gospel preached to them … but there is no such thing as spirits being baptised. … Since this order has been preached here, the waters have been continually troubled. During conference there were sometimes from eight to ten Elders in the river at a time baptising. … I want to be baptised for my Mother. I calculated to wait until you come home, but the last time Joseph spoke upon the subject, he advised every one to be up and a doing, and liberate their friends from bondage as quick as possible. So I think I shall go forward this week, as there is a number of the neighbors going forward. Some have already been baptised a number of times over. … Thus you see there is a chance for all. Is not this a glorious doctrine?”",
        "Once the baptismal font was completed in the Nauvoo Temple, vicarious baptisms were performed there instead of in the river. Phebe Chase, a resident of Nauvoo, wrote to her mother about the temple, describing the baptismal font as the place where “we can be baptised for our dead and become saviors on Mount Zion.” She went on to explain that in this font, “I have been baptised for my dear father and all the rest of my dead friends. … Now I want to know what your father’s and Mother’s names are so that I can release them, for I desire to relieve the Dead. … The Lord has spoken again and restored the ancient order.”",

I intend to do what I can to save my friends and I should be very glad if some of you would come and help me for it is a great work for one to do alone. … I expect you will think this is a strange doctrine but you will find it to be true.”"

        "There are many things we don’t know about exaltation or life in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom—the kind of life God lives. Much of it may be beyond our current ability to understand. But God has revealed a few precious clues, and many of them are found in Doctrine and Covenants 130–32 . You might read with questions like these in mind: What do I learn about God? What do I learn about the life after mortality? How does this information about eternal life bless my life now?",

        "See also 1 Nephi 17:35 ; Doctrine and Covenants 82:10 .",
        "Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord restored the truth that marriage and family relationships can be eternal. As you read Doctrine and Covenants 132:13–21 , look for phrases that help you understand the difference between what will “remain” eternally and what will not. What do you think it means for a marriage relationship to be “by [the Lord]”? ( verse 14 ).",
        "In his message “ In Praise of Those Who Save ,” President Dieter F. Uchtdorf contrasts eternal marriage relationships with “disposable” things ( Ensign or Liahona , May 2016, 77–78). What does this contrast teach you about how to nurture—or prepare for—a marriage relationship? Think about your family relationships—now and in the future—as you read Elder Uchtdorf’s message. What do you find there that gives you hope in Christ for your family relationships?",

Eyring shared this counsel he received when he was worried about his family situation: “You just live worthy of the celestial kingdom, and the family arrangements will be more wonderful than you can imagine” (in “ A Home Where the Spirit of the Lord Dwells ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2019, 25). How could this counsel help you or someone you know?",

The greatness of God, the glory of heaven, and the vastness of eternity can seem almost familiar in the light of the restored gospel, even to finite minds like ours. The revelations in\nDoctrine and Covenants 129–32\nare a good example. What is God like? He “has a body … as tangible as man’s.” What is heaven like? “That same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 130:22, 2\n). In fact, one of the most joyous truths about heaven is that it can include our cherished family relationships, if sealed by the proper authority. Truths like these can make heaven feel less distant—glorious yet reachable.\nBut then, sometimes God may ask us to do things that seem uncomfortable and unreachable. For many early Saints, plural marriage was one such commandment. It was a severe trial of faith for Joseph Smith, his wife Emma, and almost everyone who received it. To make it through this trial, they needed more than just favorable feelings about the restored gospel; they needed faith in God that went far deeper than that. The commandment no longer stands today, but the faithful example of people who lived it still does. And this example inspires us when we are asked to make our own “sacrifices in obedience” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 132:50\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 130–132\nGod wants to exalt His children.\nThere are many things we don’t know about exaltation or life in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom—the kind of life God lives.

Among the print jobs in progress at the time was the Book of Commandments—the Church’s first attempt to compile God’s latter-day revelations into one volume. The mob scattered the unbound pages, and although courageous Saints preserved some of them, only a few incomplete copies of the Book of Commandments are known to have survived.\nWhat we now know as\nsection 133\nof the Doctrine and Covenants was meant to be the appendix to the Book of Commandments, like an exclamation point at the end of the Lord’s published revelations. It warns of a coming day of judgment and repeats the call found throughout modern revelation: Flee worldliness, as symbolized by Babylon. Build Zion. Prepare for the Second Coming. And spread this message “unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people” (\nverse 37\n). The original plans for the Book of Commandments were not fulfilled, but this revelation is a reminder and a witness that the Lord’s work will go forward, “for he shall make bare his holy arm … , and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of their God” (\nverse 3\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 133:4–14\nJesus Christ calls me to reject Babylon and come to Zion.\nThe spiritual opposite of Zion is Babylon—an ancient city that throughout scripture symbolized wickedness and spiritual bondage.

Share with each other your love for the Savior and your feelings about His return.\nDoctrine and Covenants 133:52–53\nJesus Christ is loving and kind.\nYou and your children could look at pictures that show that Jesus is loving and kind. (For example, see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 42\n,\n47\n.) What else has Jesus done to show His love and kindness? Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 133:52\n, and help your children think of ways they can “mention the loving kindness of their Lord” to others.\nDetail from\nIn His Light\n, by Greg Olsen\nTeach clear and simple doctrine.\nThe Lord teaches His gospel in “plainness and simplicity” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 133:57\n). What do these words suggest to you about teaching the gospel to your family or class?\nDoctrine and Covenants 134: 1–2\nThe Lord wants me to obey the law.\nYour children could list rules or laws they obey. What would life be like if no one obeyed these laws? Then you could read\nDoctrine and Covenants 134:1–2\nwith them, helping them understand any words or phrases they might not understand. Why does the Lord want us to obey the law? (see also\nArticles of Faith 1:12\n).\nChrist in a Red Robe\n, by Minerva Teichert\nOpen PDF"

He and his friends tried to comfort each other by reading from the Book of Mormon and singing hymns. Then gunshots were heard, and within a few minutes the mortal lives of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum had come to an end.\nAnd yet it was not the end of the divine cause they had embraced. And it was not the end of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There was more work to do and more revelation that would guide the Church forward. The end of the Prophet’s life was not the end of the work of God.\nSee\nSaints\n,\n1:521–52\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 135\n;\n136:37–39\nJoseph and Hyrum Smith sealed their testimonies with their blood.\nImagine how you might have felt if you had been living in Nauvoo when Joseph and Hyrum Smith were killed (see\nSaints\n,\n1:554–55\n). How would you have made sense of this tragic event?\nDoctrine and Covenants 135\n, published three months later, may have helped. As you search this section, consider what would have brought you understanding and reassurance. What would you say to someone who asks, “Why would God allow His Prophet to be killed?” (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 136:37–39\n).\nYou could also search\nsection 135\nfor words or phrases that inspire you to be faithful to Christ to the end, like Joseph and Hyrum were.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 5:21–22\n; “\nRemembering the Martyrdom\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 299–306;\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith\n(2011),\n522–23\n,\n529–40\n; “Testimony of the Book of Mormon” (video), Gospel Library.\nTestimony of the Book of Mormon\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:3\nJoseph Smith was a prophet and witness of Jesus Christ.\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:3\nnames some of the things Joseph Smith accomplished “in the short space of twenty years.” How have these things affected you and your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Consider how you would complete a sentence like this one:\nBecause of what the Lord did through Joseph Smith, I …\nYou might also record and share your testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith with others.\nAnother way to learn about Joseph Smith’s mission is to try writing a brief obituary or eulogy for him. What would you say to build faith in Christ and His restored gospel? You might want to include important events or accomplishments found in\nDoctrine and Covenants 135\nor those mentioned in the resources below.\nJesus Christ revealed many truths about Himself and His Atonement through Joseph Smith. Consider pondering the experience you have had studying the Doctrine and Covenants this year. What truths have stood out to you? You may want to share these with your family, class or quorum members, or others as you study this week. How do these truths help you understand and draw closer to the Savior?\nSee also “Joseph Smith: The Prophet of the Restoration” (video), Gospel Library; Tad R. Callister, “\nJoseph Smith—Prophet of the Restoration\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2009, 35–37; “\nPraise to the Man\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 27; Topics and Questions, “\nJoseph Smith\n,” Gospel Library.\nJoseph Smith: The Prophet of the Restoration\nRelated Music\nSinging the following hymns or watching the videos could invite the Holy Ghost or inspire a discussion about the work of the Prophet Joseph Smith and the sacrifices of the Saints who continued after him.\n“\nA Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 29). While in Carthage Jail, John Taylor sang this hymn.\n“\nPraise to the Man\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 27; see also video). The text of this hymn was written as a tribute to Joseph Smith.\nPraise to the Man – The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square\n“\nCome, Come, Ye Saints\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 30; see also video).\nCome, Come, Ye Saints - Mormon Tabernacle Choir\n“Faith in Every Footstep” (see video).\nFaith in Every Footstep - Mormon Tabernacle Choir\nDoctrine and Covenants 136\nI can help accomplish the Lord’s will as I follow His counsel.\nAfter Joseph Smith died, the Saints were driven from Nauvoo. They now faced a 1,300-mile (2,100 km) journey through a harsh wilderness. Brigham Young, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, worried about how the Saints would survive the trek. In a temporary settlement called Winter Quarters, he pleaded for guidance. The Lord’s response is recorded in\nsection 136\n. “By helping the Saints remember that their conduct on the journey was as important as their destination, the revelation helped transform the westward migration from an unfortunate necessity into an important shared spiritual experience” (“\nThis Shall Be Our Covenant\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 308).\nKeep this in mind as you study\nsection 136\n. What counsel do you find that could help turn a difficult trial in your life “into an important … spiritual experience”? You might ponder how this counsel can help you accomplish the Lord’s will in your own life, as it helped the early Saints in their travels.\nSee also “\nThis Shall Be Our Covenant\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 307–14; “\nCome, Come, Ye Saints\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 30; Church History Topics, “\nSuccession of Church Leadership\n,” Gospel Library.\nDetail from\nWinter Quarters\n, by Greg Olsen\nPeople, Places, Events\nJoseph Smith Jr.\nBrigham Young\nDeaths of Joseph and Hyrum Smith\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:1–2, 4–5\nJoseph and Hyrum Smith gave their lives for Jesus Christ and His gospel.\nSummarize for your children\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:1\nor share “\nChapter 57: The Prophet Is Killed\n” (in\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 201–5, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). This could be a good opportunity for you and your children to share your feelings about the sacrifice Joseph and Hyrum made for the Savior and His gospel.\nJoseph and Hyrum Give Their Lives for the Gospel\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:4–5\nstates that Hyrum Smith read a passage from the Book of Mormon before he went to Carthage Jail. You and your children could read this passage together (see\nEther 12:36–38\n). How could these verses have comforted Hyrum? You could also share scriptures that bring you comfort when you are worried or sad.\nYou and your children could look at pictures of prophets (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n7\n,\n14\n,\n67\n) and talk about some things God asks prophets to do. What did these prophets sacrifice for the Savior?\nIn the home, learning and living are inseparable.\n“The gospel takes on immediate relevance in the home. There the people with whom you are learning the gospel are the people with whom you will live it—every day. In fact, much of the time, living the gospel is how we learn the gospel” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n31\n).\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:3\nJoseph Smith was a prophet and witness of Jesus Christ.\nTo help your children remember and appreciate how the Lord has blessed us through Joseph Smith’s mission, you could display objects that represent things Joseph did, such as the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, or a picture of a temple (see also this week’s\nactivity page\n). Then your children could look in\nDoctrine and Covenants 135:3\nfor some things Joseph Smith did to help us come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Invite your children to share why they are grateful for these things.\nThe Man Who Communed with Jehovah\nAmerican Prophet\n, by Del Parson\nDoctrine and Covenants 136\nThe Lord can bless me when I am struggling.\nConsider placing a picture of the Nauvoo Temple on one side of a room and creating a simple shelter on the other side. Invite your children to gather near the picture, and tell them about the Saints who had to leave Nauvoo after Joseph Smith died (see\nchapters 58\n,\n60\n, and\n62\nin\nDoctrine and Covenants Stories\n, 206–8, 211–16, 222–24, or the corresponding videos in Gospel Library). Emphasize the faith these Saints had in Jesus Christ, and invite your children to walk to the shelter to represent the journey to Winter Quarters. They could sing a song like “\nTo Be a Pioneer\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 218–19) as they walk.\nLeaving Nauvoo and Going West\nExplain that in\nDoctrine and Covenants 136\n, the Lord gave counsel to help the Saints on their journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Help your children find something in this revelation that could give them courage for this journey (see\nverses 4, 10–11, 18–30\n). How can this counsel help us with the trials we face today?\nGreater Love Hath No Man\n, by Casey Childs\nOpen PDF"

Barrett\nDecember 1–7: “The Vision of the Redemption of the Dead”\nDoctrine and Covenants 137–138\nThe revelations recorded in\nDoctrine and Covenants 137\nand\n138\nare separated by more than 80 years and 1,500 miles (2,400 km).\nSection 137\nwas received by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1836 in the Kirtland Temple, and\nsection 138\nwas received by Joseph F. Smith, sixth President of the Church, in 1918 in Salt Lake City. But doctrinally, these two visions belong side by side. They both answer questions that many people—including God’s prophets—have about life after death. Joseph Smith wondered about the fate of his brother Alvin, who had died without being baptized. Joseph F. Smith, who had lost both of his parents and 13 children to untimely deaths, thought often about the spirit world and wondered about the preaching of the gospel there.\nSection 137\ncasts some initial light on the destiny of God’s children in the next life, and section\n138\nopens the curtains even wider. Together, both revelations testify of “the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:3\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDoctrine and Covenants 137\n;\n138:30–37, 57–60\nAll of Heavenly Father’s children will have the opportunity to choose eternal life.\nAlvin Smith, the Prophet Joseph’s beloved brother, passed away six years before God restored the authority to baptize. The common understanding among some Christians in 1836 was that if a person died without being baptized, that person could not go to heaven. Joseph wondered about Alvin’s eternal salvation for many years—until he received the revelation in\nDoctrine and Covenants 137\n.\nMany people today have similar questions. Why would God require ordinances and covenants when so many people never have the opportunity to receive them? What would you say to someone who wonders this? How would you build their faith in God and His requirements for salvation? Look for truths you could share in\nsection 137\nand in\nsection 138:30–37, 57–60\n. You could also look for these truths expressed in the hymn “\nThe Glorious Gospel Light Has Shone\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 283) and in President Henry B. Eyring’s message “\nGathering the Family of God\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 19–22).\nAs you study and ponder, you might record your impressions by completing sentences like these:\nBecause of these revelations, I know that Heavenly Father\n.\nBecause of these revelations, I know that the Father’s plan of salvation\n.\nBecause of these revelations, I want to\n.\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n1:232–35\n.\nNoah’s Story | Temple Experience\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:1–11, 25–30\nReading and pondering the scriptures prepares me to receive revelation.\nSometimes revelation comes even though we do not seek it. But more often it comes because we diligently search and prepare for it. As you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:1–11, 25–30\n, note what President Joseph F. Smith was pondering when “the eyes of [his] understanding were opened.” You could also compare his experience to\n1 Nephi 11:1–6\n;\nJoseph Smith—History 1:12–19\n. Then consider how you can follow President Smith’s example. For instance, what changes do you feel inspired to make to your scripture study to receive more personal revelation?\nIn his message “\nThe Vision of the Redemption of the Dead\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 71–74), President M. Russell Ballard suggested other ways President Smith was prepared to receive this revelation. What do you learn from his experiences? Consider how the Lord has prepared you for experiences you are having—and how He might be preparing you for experiences in your future.\nSee also\nSaints\n,\n3:202–5\n; “Ministry of Joseph F. Smith: A Vision of the Redemption of the Dead” (video), Gospel Library.\nMinistry of Joseph F. Smith: A Vision of the Redemption of the Dead\nJoseph F. Smith\n, by Albert Salzbrenner\nInvite the Spirit.\n“What have you observed that contributes to a spiritual environment for learning the gospel? What detracts from it?” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n18\n). As you study President Joseph F. Smith’s experience in\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:1–11\n, consider how you can encourage pondering and invite spiritual impressions for yourself and, if you are a teacher, for the people you teach.\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:25–60\nThe Savior’s work continues on the other side of the veil.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “Our message to the world is simple and sincere: we invite all of God’s children on both sides of the veil to come unto their Savior, receive the blessings of the holy temple, have enduring joy, and qualify for eternal life” (“\nLet Us All Press On\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 118–19). Ponder this statement as you read\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:25–60\n. You could also consider these questions:\nWhat do you learn from these verses about how the Savior’s work is being accomplished in the spirit world? Why is it important for you to know that this work is taking place?\nWhat impresses you about the Lord’s messengers in the spirit world?\nHow does this revelation strengthen your faith in God’s plan of redemption?\nIf you’d like to learn more about the spirit world, you could study President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “\nTrust in the Lord\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 26–29).\nSee also “\nSusa Young Gates and the Vision of the Redemption of the Dead\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 315–22; “A Visit from Father” (video), Gospel Library.\nA Visit from Father\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nDoctrine and Covenants Historical Resources: Alvin Smith\nJoseph F.

Perhaps you could also talk about someone you know who died without the chance to be baptized. What does\nDoctrine and Covenants 137:5–10\nteach us about that person?\nMinistry of Joseph Smith: Temples\nChapter 39: The Kirtland Temple Is Dedicated: January–March 1836\nConsider using a picture of the Savior’s tomb (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nno. 58\n, or Bible Photographs,\nno. 14\n) and the picture at the end of this outline to teach your children where Jesus’s spirit went when His body was in the tomb. Then you could read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:18–19, 23–24, 27–30\nto learn about what Jesus did while He was there. Who did He visit? What did He ask them to do? Why did He do this?\nYou could also use this week’s\nactivity page\nto help your children compare what missionaries teach on this side of the veil (see, for example,\nArticles of Faith 1:4\n) with what missionaries teach in the spirit world (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:33\n). What is similar in these verses, and what is different? What does this teach us about Heavenly Father and His plan?\nPondering the scriptures invites the Holy Ghost.\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:1–11\nWhen I ponder the scriptures, the Holy Ghost can help me understand them.\nAs you and your children read\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:1–11\ntogether, you could invite them to pretend they are President Joseph F. Smith and do actions that go along with the words in\nverses 6 and 11\n. You might also show them a picture of President Smith (there’s one in this outline) and explain that he was the sixth President of the Church. You could also talk about a time when you pondered something in the scriptures and the Holy Ghost helped you understand it.\nConsider singing together a song about scripture study, such as “\nSearch, Ponder, and Pray\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 109). What does this song say we should do to understand the scriptures?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe Commissioned\n, by Harold I. Hopkinson\nOpen PDF"

In some cases, that revelation has included changes to the policies and practices of the Church.\nOfficial Declarations 1\nand\n2\nannounced this kind of revelation—one led to the end of plural marriage, and the other made the blessings of the priesthood available to people of all races. Changes like these are part of what it means to have a “true and living church” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:30\n), with a true and living prophet, led by a true and living God.\nBut eternal truth doesn’t change, though our understanding of it does. And sometimes revelation casts additional light on truth.\nThe Articles of Faith\nserve this clarifying purpose. The Church is solidly founded on eternal truth yet can grow and change “according as the Lord will, suiting his mercies according to the conditions of the children of men” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 46:15\n). In other words, “We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God” (\nArticles of Faith 1:9\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nThe Articles of Faith\nThe Articles of Faith contain foundational truths of the restored gospel.\nConsider this approach to studying the Articles of Faith: For each article of faith, make a “mini-lesson” to explain what you believe. Your mini-lesson could include a related scripture, picture, hymn or children’s song, or personal experience about living a truth that the article of faith teaches.\nWhat difference do these truths make in your relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How have the Articles of Faith improved your gospel study or helped you share the gospel with others?\nSee also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nArticles of Faith\n,” Gospel Library; L. Tom Perry, “\nThe Doctrines and Principles Contained in the Articles of Faith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 46–48; “\nChapter 38: The Wentworth Letter\n,” in\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith\n(2011), 435–47.\nArticles of Faith 1:9\n;\nOfficial Declarations 1\nand\n2\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is guided by revelation.\n“We believe that [God] will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God” (\nArticles of Faith 1:9\n). With this principle in mind, review\nOfficial Declarations 1\nand\n2\n, and look for words and phrases that strengthen your faith in continuing revelation. How have these revelations affected your life? How have they helped the work of Heavenly Father’s kingdom progress?\nWhat evidence do you see that the Church is led “by the inspiration of Almighty God” today? (\nOfficial Declaration 1\n). Perhaps you could review one or more\nrecent general conference messages\n, looking for how the Lord is guiding His Church—and your life. The most recent message from the President of the Church may be a good place to start.\nWhat can you do if you or someone you love struggles to understand or accept what the Lord teaches through His prophets? Why are you grateful for a prophet?\nSee also\nAmos 3:7\n;\n2 Nephi 28:30\n; Allen D. Haynie, “\nA Living Prophet for the Latter Days\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 25–28; Topics and Questions, “\nProphets\n,” Gospel Library; “\nWe Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 19.\nOfficial Declaration 1\nThe work of God must move forward.\nIn the “Excerpts from Three Addresses by President Wilford Woodruff regarding the Manifesto” (at the end of\nOfficial Declaration 1\n), what reasons did the prophet give for the Lord ending the practice of plural marriage? What does this teach you about God’s work?\nFor more information about the historical background of\nOfficial Declaration 1\n, see\nSaints\n, 2:602–15; “\nThe Messenger and the Manifesto\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 323–31; Topics and Questions, “\nPlural Marriage and Families in Early Utah\n,” Gospel Library.\nWilford Woodruff\n, by H. E. Peterson\nOfficial Declaration 2\nI can trust in the Lord, even when I do not have a perfect understanding.\nWe don’t know why priesthood ordination and temple ordinances were not available to Church members of African descent for a time. Even when facing difficult unanswered questions about that policy, many Black Latter-day Saints trusted the Lord (see\nProverbs 3:5\n) and stayed faithful to Him throughout their lives. Learning about their faith and experiences could be inspiring to you. Here are some of their accounts, found at\nhistory.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n:\n“\nJane Elizabeth Manning James\n”\n“\nIn My Father’s House Are Many Mansions\n” (story of Green Flake)\n“\nYou Have Come at Last\n” (story of Anthony Obinna)\n“\nBreak the Soil of Bitterness\n” (story of Julia Mavimbela)\n“\nI Will Take It in Faith\n” (story of George Rickford)\n“\nLong-Promised Day\n” (story of Joseph W. B. Johnson)\nAs you read\nOfficial Declaration 2\n, what do you learn about the Lord’s process for guiding the policies of His Church? Ponder how you have learned to trust the Lord even when you don’t have a perfect understanding.\nSee also\n2 Nephi 26:33\n; “\nWitnessing the Faithfulness\n,” in\nRevelations in Context\n, 332–41; Topics and Questions, “\nRace and the Priesthood\n,” Gospel Library; Ahmad Corbitt, “\nA Personal Essay on Race and the Priesthood\n,” parts 1–4,\nhistory.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n;\nBeOne.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe Power of Ministering to the One\nIt’s OK to say “I don’t know.”\nWhile you should try your best to help the people you teach to answer their questions about the gospel, the Lord doesn’t expect you to know everything. When you don’t know how to answer something, admit it. Then point learners to revealed doctrine, and bear sincere testimony of what you do know.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nWilford Woodruff\nSpencer W.

What do you learn when you study the proclamation this way? How does this help you understand why marriage and family are essential to God’s plan? How do the truths in the proclamation influence your choices?",
        "There are many people who, for a variety of reasons, might be fearful about marriage or raising children. If a friend said to you, “I don’t ever want to get married or have a family,” what would you say? Perhaps you could search the proclamation looking for something that would help your friend have hope in God’s plan.",

      "plain_text": "“December 15–21: ‘The Family Is Central to the Creator’s Plan’: The Family: A Proclamation to the World,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Doctrine and Covenants 2025\n(2025)\n“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2025\nDecember 15–21: “The Family Is Central to the Creator’s Plan”\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\nEven before we were born, we were part of a family—the family of our heavenly parents. That pattern continues on earth. Families here, at their best, are meant to echo the perfect pattern in heaven.\nOf course, there are no guarantees that earthly families will be ideal or even functional. But as President Henry B. Eyring taught, families “give God’s children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heaven—parental love” (“\nGathering the Family of God\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 20). Knowing that families are imperfect and subject to attacks from the adversary, God sent His Beloved Son to redeem us and heal our families. And He sent latter-day prophets with a proclamation to defend and strengthen families. If we follow the prophets and put faith in the Savior, even though mortal families fall short of the divine ideal, there’s hope for families—on earth and in heaven.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n“The family is central to the Creator’s plan.”\n“\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” is clearly about families. But it is equally about God’s plan of salvation. One way to study the proclamation is to write the phrases\npremortal life\n,\nmortal life\n, and\npostmortal life\non a piece of paper and list what the proclamation teaches about each of these topics. What do you learn when you study the proclamation this way? How does this help you understand why marriage and family are essential to God’s plan? How do the truths in the proclamation influence your choices?\nThere are many people who, for a variety of reasons, might be fearful about marriage or raising children. If a friend said to you, “I don’t ever want to get married or have a family,” what would you say? Perhaps you could search the proclamation looking for something that would help your friend have hope in God’s plan.\nAnother question you might be asked—or that you might ask yourself—is one like this: “What if my family situation does not match what’s described in the family proclamation?” Here are two places you could look for prophetic counsel: the section “\nA Mighty Change\n” in Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “\nJesus Christ Is the Strength of Parents\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 55–59) and the last four paragraphs of Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nWhy Marriage, Why Family\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 52).\nWhat do you feel inspired to do because of what you have studied?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nThe Plan and the Proclamation\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 28–31; Topics and Questions, “\nFamily\n,” Gospel Library.\n“Each [person] is a beloved son or daughter of heavenly parents.”\nWe often think of the family proclamation as a guide for family life. But it also teaches important truths about our heavenly family and eternal identity. Why is it important for you to know that we are all part of this family? How does this truth influence the choices you make?\nSee also “\nI Am a Child of God\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 301.\n“Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.”\nThink of\nparagraphs 6 and 7\nof the\nfamily proclamation\nas a pattern for “happiness in family life.” As you read these paragraphs, identify principles of “successful marriages and families.” You might think about examples of these principles that you have seen in your own family or other families. How do these principles help make Jesus Christ the foundation of family life?\nThen you might think about a family relationship you would like to strengthen. Make a plan, with the Savior’s help, to act on impressions you receive.\nSee also L. Whitney Clayton, “\nThe Finest Homes\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 107–9.\nParents should raise their children in love and righteousness.\n“We call upon responsible citizens … to maintain and strengthen the family.”\nThe\nlast paragraph\nof the\nfamily proclamation\nincludes a call to action. As you consider how you will respond to that call, it might help to study the title of the proclamation. For instance, what is a proclamation? What does that word imply to you about this document’s message? What qualified the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles to issue a proclamation to the world about families? You might also make a list of what you consider to be the main messages of the proclamation. How can you promote these messages in your life, in your home, and in your community?\nSee also Bonnie L. Oscarson, “\nDefenders of the Family Proclamation\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 14–17; “Defenders of the Faith” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Family Proclamation—Words from God\nDefenders of the Faith\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nPeople, Places, Events\nGordon B. Hinckley\nClick to see more\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nFamilies are important in Heavenly Father’s plan.\nHelp your children think of things that are so important that they would want to tell everyone about them.

Why are families so important to Him? (see also the video “\nWhat Is the Purpose of Family?\n” [\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n]).\nThe Family-Centered Gospel of Jesus Christ\nWhat Is the Purpose of Family?\nShare with your children something from the proclamation that you feel we all need to know. Invite the children to share their feelings about those truths. How would our lives be different if we did not know these things? You might sing together a song that relates to truths found in the proclamation, such as “\nI Will Follow God’s Plan\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 164–65).\nIn\nsection IV\nof his message “\nThe Plan and the Proclamation\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 30), President Dallin H.

      "plain_text": "“December 22–28: ‘The Matchless Gift of God’s Divine Son,’”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Doctrine and Covenants 2025\n(2025)\n“Christmas,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2025\nDetail from\nNativity in Copper and Umber\n, by J. Kirk Richards\nDecember 22–28: The Matchless Gift of God’s Divine Son\nChristmas\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith declared, “The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it” (\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith\n[2011],\n49\n). Over 160 years later, this statement inspired the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles to publish “\nThe Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles\n” in honor of the 2,000th anniversary of the Savior’s birth (see Russell M. Nelson, “\nDrawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 40).\nAs Latter-day Saints, we rejoice in the blessing of continuing revelation through modern prophets and apostles. We are thankful for their inspired words of counsel, warning, and encouragement. But most of all, we are blessed by their powerful testimonies of Jesus Christ—at Christmastime and throughout the year. These are more than just stirring words of skilled writers or public speakers or insights from scriptural experts. They are the words of God’s chosen, called, and authorized “special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 107:23\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n“None other has had so profound an influence.”\nWhat would you say in support of the statement that “none other has had so profound an influence [as Jesus Christ] upon all who have lived and will yet live upon the earth”? Look for passages in “\nThe Living Christ\n” that testify of the Savior’s profound influence. How has He influenced you?\nSuppose someone who is unfamiliar with Christianity asked you why you celebrate Christmas. How would you respond? Review “\nThe Living Christ\n” with this question in mind, and consider writing down any thoughts or impressions that come to you.\nSee also “Why We Need a Savior” (video), Gospel Library.\nWhy We Need a Savior\n“He rose from the grave.”\nIn “\nThe Living Christ\n,” the Apostles testify of the Resurrection of the Savior, mentioning three appearances of the risen Lord (see\nparagraph 5\n). Consider reading some accounts of these visits in\nJohn 20\n;\n3 Nephi 11\n; and\nJoseph Smith—History 1:14–20\n. What do you learn about the Savior from His words and actions during these appearances?\nFocus on the Savior.\n“Prayerfully reading ‘\nThe Living Christ\n’ is like reading the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and the prophets of the Book of Mormon. It will increase your faith in the Savior and help you stay focused on Him” (M. Russell Ballard, “\nReturn and Receive\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 65).\n“His priesthood and His Church have been restored.”\nDuring your study of the Doctrine and Covenants this year, you have had the opportunity to learn more about how the Savior’s “priesthood and His Church have been restored.” Which restored truths or principles have been especially meaningful to you? Consider reviewing some of the following scriptures that teach about the Restoration:\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:17–23\n;\n13\n;\n20:1–12\n;\n65\n;\n110\n;\n112:30–32\n;\n124:39–42\n;\n128:19–21\n. Ponder how the truths of the restored gospel help you know and love Jesus Christ.\n“He will someday return to earth.”\nChristmas is a time to look back on the day Jesus Christ was born and to look forward to the day He will come again. What do you learn about His return from the\nsecond-to-last paragraph\nof “\nThe Living Christ\n”? You might also consider reading, singing, or listening to Christmas hymns that teach about the Second Coming, such as “\nJoy to the World\n” or “\nIt Came upon the Midnight Clear\n” (\nHymns\n, nos. 201, 207).\n“He is the light, the life, and the hope of the world.”\nIn the\nfinal paragraph\nof “\nThe Living Christ\n,” note the attributes and titles given for the Savior. Consider spending time learning about some of them. For example:\nLight:\nHow is Jesus Christ like a light to you? You might consider drawing a picture or taking a photo that, to you, represents the light He gives you. What do you feel inspired to do to share His light? (See also\nJohn 8:12\n;\n3 Nephi 18:24\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:24\n.)\nLife:\nWhy do you think\nlife\nis a good word to describe Jesus Christ? In what sense does He give you life? How would your life be different without Him and His gospel? (See also\nJohn 10:10\n;\n1 Corinthians 15:19–23\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 66:2\n.)\nHope:\nWhat do you hope for because of Jesus Christ and His gospel? Do you know someone who feels hopeless about the future? Ponder how you might share with that person the hope you feel in Jesus Christ. (See also\nRomans 8:24–25\n;\nEther 12:4\n;\nMoroni 7:41\n.)\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nJesus Christ\n,” Gospel Library.\nThe Light, the Life, and the Hope of the World\n“God be thanked for [His] matchless gift.”\nIn “\nThe Living Christ\n,” the Apostles refer to the Savior as a “gift” from our Heavenly Father. Based on what you find in “\nThe Living Christ\n,” how would you complete this sentence: “Through Jesus Christ, God gives me the gifts of …” Ponder what you can do to receive these gifts more fully.\nHow has studying “\nThe Living Christ\n” affected your faith in and love for the Savior?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nFour Gifts That Jesus Christ Offers to You\n” (First Presidency Christmas devotional, Dec. 2, 2018), Gospel Library; “Excerpts from ‘The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles’” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nExcerpts from \"The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles\"\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nI can “offer [my] testimony” to celebrate Jesus’s birth.\nConsider how you might introduce your children to “\nThe Living Christ\n.” Maybe you could help them point to the name\nChrist\nin the title and the signatures of the First Presidency and Twelve. You might explain that this is their testimony of Jesus Christ that they wanted to share with the world.\nYou could give each child a phrase from “\nThe Living Christ\n” and ask them to find or draw a picture of that phrase. Then you could help them find the phrase in “\nThe Living Christ\n.” You might even compile those pictures and phrases into a book.\nShare with one another how you gained your testimony of Jesus Christ. Maybe you could pass around a picture of the Savior and take turns sharing something you know about Him (including truths taught in “\nThe Living Christ\n”).\n“He went about doing good.”\nAs you and your children read the second paragraph of “\nThe Living Christ\n,” talk with them about some of the things Jesus did.

This includes helping them prepare to make and keep sacred covenants, such as the covenant of baptism and the covenants made in the temple. Through these covenants, your children will be able to joyfully bind themselves to the Savior, Jesus Christ.\nThere are many ways to prepare your children for this journey on the covenant path, and Heavenly Father will help you discover the best way to help them. As you seek inspiration, keep in mind that not all learning happens during scheduled lessons. In fact, part of what makes learning at home so powerful is the opportunity to learn by example and through small, simple teaching moments—the kind that occur naturally in the flow of daily living. Just as following the covenant path is a consistent, lifelong process, so is learning about the covenant path. (See “\nHome and Family\n,”\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n[2022], 30–31.)\nBelow are some ideas that may lead to further inspiration. You can find additional ideas for teaching Primary-age children in “\nAppendix B: For Primary—Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nBaptism and Confirmation\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] should enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” (\n2 Nephi 31:17\n). Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenants by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] should enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” (\n2 Nephi 31:17\n).\nHere are some resources that can help you:\n2 Nephi 31\n; special issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine about baptism; Topics and Questions, “\nBaptism\n,” Gospel Library.\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child. Help them understand that faith is something that can grow stronger and stronger throughout life. What are some things your child can do to develop stronger faith in Christ before they are baptized?\nWhen your child makes a wrong choice, speak joyfully about the gift of repentance. And when you make a wrong choice, share the joy that comes when you repent. Testify that because Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, we can repent daily, be forgiven, and receive the power to change. When your child seeks forgiveness, forgive freely and joyfully.\nTell your child about your baptism. Show pictures and share memories. Talk about how you felt, how keeping your baptismal covenants has helped you come to know Jesus Christ better, and how your covenants continue to bless your life. Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like the following: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something they promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (See\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n.)\nTalk about how being confirmed and becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has blessed you. For example, how have you come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you have served others and as others have served you? Help your child think of ways to serve and strengthen others as a member of the Church. Also help them experience and recognize the joy that comes from service.\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell them about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have. Invite your child to share how they feel. Note the variety of ways the Spirit can speak to people, including ways He speaks to you personally. Help your child recognize and share with you moments when they may be experiencing the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nWatch together a few of the videos in the Gospel Library collection titled “\nHear Him!\n” Talk together about the different ways the Lord’s servants hear His voice. Invite your child to draw a picture or make a video about how they hear the Savior’s voice.\nMake the sacrament a sacred and joyful event in your family. Share with your child how you focus on Jesus Christ during the sacrament. Help your child make a plan to show that the sacrament is sacred to them. For example, listening to the words of the sacrament prayers can remind us of our baptismal covenants.\nMany issues of the\nFriend\nmagazine include articles, stories, and activities to help children prepare for baptism and confirmation. Let your child choose some to read and enjoy with you. (See also the collection “\nPreparing for Baptism\n” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library.)\nPriesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nThe priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “All Church members who keep their covenants—women, men, and children—are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families” (\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n3.6\n, Gospel Library). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n2.2\n).\nWhen men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. All of Heavenly Father’s children—His sons and His daughters—will be blessed as they come to better understand the priesthood.\nWe receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. “Worthy male Church members receive priesthood authority through priesthood conferral and ordination to priesthood offices” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.4\n). Those who hold priesthood offices can be authorized by someone who holds priesthood keys to perform priesthood ordinances.\nTo learn more about the priesthood, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Price of Priesthood Power\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 66–69; “\nPriesthood Principles\n,”\nchapter 3\nin\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nMake priesthood ordinances a consistent part of your family life. For example, help your child prepare spiritually for the sacrament each week. Encourage your child to seek priesthood blessings when they are sick or need comfort or direction. Make it a habit to point out ways the Lord is blessing your family through priesthood power.\nAs you read the scriptures together, watch for opportunities to discuss how God blesses people through His power. Share your own experiences of when God has blessed you through His priesthood. For examples of blessings we receive from God through the priesthood, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.2\n,\n3.5\n.\nTeach your child that after baptism, they can receive priesthood power by keeping the baptismal covenant. Review together President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nSpiritual Treasures\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79). Tell your child how priesthood ordinances have brought God’s power into your life. For a list of some of the ways we are blessed by priesthood power, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.5\n.\nDiscuss the question “What is a servant of the Lord like?” Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:36–42\n, and look for answers. Whenever you notice your child (or someone else) applying one of the principles or attributes in these verses, point it out.\nWhen you or your child uses keys to unlock a door or start a car, take a moment to compare those keys to the keys that priesthood leaders hold. (For a definition of priesthood keys, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.4.1\n). What do priesthood keys “unlock” or “start” for us? See also Gary E. Stevenson, “\nWhere Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 29–32; “Where Are the Keys?” (video), Gospel Library.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nWhen you are set apart for a calling, invite your child to be present, if possible. Let your child see you fulfilling your calling. You might even look for appropriate ways they can help you. Describe how you feel the Lord’s power in your calling.\nBeing Baptized and Confirmed for Ancestors\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In the house of the Lord, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including people who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year your child turns 12, they are old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors (see also\n1 Corinthians 15:29\n).\nGo to the house of the Lord as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the temple recommend questions together. You can find them on\npages 36–37\nof\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n(2022). Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together\nMalachi 4:6\n. Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on\nFamilySearch.org\n. Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “\nTemple\n” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “\nPreparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.)\nReceiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel to us from Heavenly Father and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching them the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Topics and Questions, “\nPatriarchal Blessings\n,” Gospel Library; Julie B. Beck, “\nYou Have a Noble Birthright\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2006, 106–8.\nShare with your child your experience of receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how He continues to guide you through this blessing. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nReview together Elder Randall K. Bennett’s message\n“Your Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father\n” and Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita’s message “\nWhen to Receive Your Patriarchal Blessing\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 42–43, 88–90). Share with each other what you learn from these messages about why Heavenly Father wants us to receive a patriarchal blessing. To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n18.17\n.\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, click\nTools\nat the top right corner of the screen, and select\nPatriarchal Blessing\n.\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and share them with your child.\nReceiving the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8\n). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the house of the Lord. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there. Look for opportunities to go to the temple with your child to perform baptisms and confirmations for their ancestors.\nExplore together\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Read together articles like “\nAbout the Temple Endowment\n” and “\nPrepare for the House of the Lord\n.” Let your child ask any questions they have about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nPrepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “\nHome-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation\n”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how they are keeping the baptismal covenant described in\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n. Also help your child notice how the Lord is blessing them. Build your child’s confidence in their ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ. You could use\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n27.2\n, to review the covenants we make in the temple. If you have received the endowment, tell your children about how the temple garment helps you remember your covenants with Jesus Christ (see “Sacred Temple Clothing” [video], Gospel Library).\nSacred Temple Clothing\nServing a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to become a missionary long before you go on a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“\nBecoming a Missionary\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2005, 45–46).

Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive from the Savior’s restored gospel and as a member of His Church.

This occurs in an ordinance called “sealing.” Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your daughter or son, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help them prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nRead together “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” (Gospel Library).

In addition, worthy male Church members can be ordained to an office in the priesthood. The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by individuals who hold priesthood keys, such as the stake president, the bishop, and quorum presidents. Priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood in doing the work of the Lord.",
        "Temples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Him, are endowed with priesthood power, receive revelation, perform ordinances for our deceased ancestors, and are sealed to our families for eternity. All of this is possible because of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.",

He said that we can enter the kingdom of God if we have faith, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end (see\n3 Nephi 11:31–40\n; see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:29\n). The activities below can help you teach the children that these principles and ordinances will help us draw closer to the Savior throughout our lives.\nTo learn more about the doctrine of Christ, see\n2 Nephi 31\n.\nPossible Activities\nGive the children pictures that represent faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and confirmation (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n1\n,\n111\n,\n103\n, and\n105\n). Read or recite with the children the\nfourth article of faith\n, and ask them to hold up their pictures when that principle or ordinance is mentioned. Help the children understand how each of these principles and ordinances helps us become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nHow can you help the children understand that faith, repentance, baptism, and confirmation are not one-time events but influence our spiritual growth throughout our lives? For instance, you could show them a picture of a seed and a large tree (or draw these things on the board). Help them think of things that help the seed grow into a large tree, such as water, soil, and sunlight. Help them see that these are like the things we do to grow closer to God throughout our lives—building our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting each day, living our baptismal covenants, partaking of the sacrament, and listening to the Holy Ghost.\nShare with the children the story about the firecracker from Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “\nHow Can Repenting Help Me Feel Happy?\n” (\nFriend\n, Dec. 2017, 12–13, or\nLiahona\n, Dec. 2017, 70–71; see also the video “Repentance: A Joyful Choice” [Gospel Library]). At various points during the story, invite the children to think about how Elder Renlund might have felt. Why do we feel joy when we repent? Share with the children the joy and love you have felt when you have asked Heavenly Father to forgive you.\nRepentance: A Joyful Choice\nBaptism\nJesus Christ set an example for me when He was baptized.\nEven though Jesus was without sin, He was baptized to set a perfect example of obedience to Heavenly Father (see\n2 Nephi 31:6–10\n).\nTo learn more about baptism, see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n; Topics and Questions, “\nBaptism\n,” Gospel Library.\nPossible Activities\nShow a picture of the Savior’s baptism and another person’s baptism (or see\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n35\nand either no.\n103\nor no.\n104\n). Ask the children to share what is different and what is the same between the two pictures. Read together\nMatthew 3:13–17\nor “\nChapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized\n” in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 26–29 (or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). Let the children point to things in the pictures that are mentioned in the reading or the video. Tell the children about your love for the Savior and your desire to follow Him.\nChapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized\nListen to or sing a song about baptism, such as “\nWhen Jesus Christ Was Baptized\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 102). What do we learn about baptism from the song? Read\n2 Nephi 31:9–10\n, and invite the children to listen for why Jesus Christ was baptized. Invite them to draw a picture of themselves on their baptism day.\nI can choose to make a covenant with God and be baptized.\nPreparing for baptism means much more than preparing for an event. It means preparing to make a covenant and then keeping that covenant for a lifetime. Ponder how you can help the children understand the covenant they will make with Heavenly Father when they are baptized, which includes the promises He makes to them and the promises they make to Him.\nPossible Activities\nExplain that a covenant is a promise between a person and Heavenly Father. As we strive to keep our promises to God, God promises to bless us. Write on the board\nMy Promises to God\nand\nGod’s Promises to Me\n. Read together\nMosiah 18:10, 13\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n, and help the children make a list of the promises they find under the appropriate headings (see also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nYour Baptism Covenant\n,”\nFriend\n, Feb. 2021, 2–3). Share how Heavenly Father has blessed you as you strive to keep your baptismal covenant.\nShow the children pictures of things Jesus Christ did during His ministry (for some examples, see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 33–49\n). Let the children talk about what Jesus is doing in each picture. Read\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n, and invite the children to listen for things they promise to do when they are baptized (see also “\nThe Baptism Covenant\n,”\nFriend\n, Feb. 2019, 7, or\nLiahona\n, Feb. 2019, F3). How will these promises influence our actions every day? Invite the children to draw a picture of themselves helping someone the way Jesus would.\nWhen we are baptized, we make promises to God and He makes promises to us.\nConfirmation\nWhen I am confirmed, I become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nBecoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints brings many blessings, including opportunities for the children to be active participants in God’s work.\nTo learn more about confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost, see Gary E. Stevenson, “\nHow Does the Holy Ghost Help You?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 117–20; Topics and Questions, “\nHoly Ghost\n,” Gospel Library.\nPossible Activities\nInvite someone who was recently baptized and confirmed to come to class and share what it was like to be confirmed. Ask this person to talk about what it means to him or her to become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Help the children think of ways they can keep their baptismal covenant as members of the Church (such as serving others, inviting others to learn more about Jesus, saying prayers in meetings, and so on). Share how doing these things has helped you feel the joy of being a member of Christ’s Church.\nShow a picture of the people at the Waters of Mormon (see\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n76\n), and ask the children to describe what they see in the picture. Tell the story of Alma and his people being baptized there (see\nMosiah 18:1–17\n; “\nChapter 15: Alma Teaches and Baptizes\n,” in\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 43–44, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library). Review\nMosiah 18:8–9\nand invite the children to do actions to help them remember the things the people were willing to do as members of Christ’s Church. For example, how can we help others “take a step toward making covenants with God”? (Russell M. Nelson, “\nHope of Israel\n” [worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018], Gospel Library). Share an experience of when you have witnessed members of the Church serving in these ways.\nAlma at the Waters of Mormon\nWhen I am confirmed, I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nWhen we are baptized and confirmed, Heavenly Father promises that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77\n). This wonderful gift from God is called the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nPossible Activities\nRead\nDoctrine and Covenants 33:15\n, and ask the children to listen for the special gift that Heavenly Father gives us when we are baptized and confirmed. To help them learn more about how the gift of the Holy Ghost will help them, review together\nJohn 14:26\n;\nGalatians 5:22–23\n;\n2 Nephi 32:5\n;\n3 Nephi 27:20\n. You could also review the article “\nThe Holy Ghost Is …\n” (\nFriend\n, June 2019, 24–25, or\nLiahona\n, June 2019, F12–F13).\nBefore class, ask the parents of one or more of the children to share how they have been blessed because they have the gift of the Holy Ghost. How does He help them? How do they hear His voice?\nSing together a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “\nThe Holy Ghost\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 105). Help the children understand what the song teaches us about how the Holy Ghost can help us.\nThe Holy Ghost can speak to me in many ways.\nChildren who can recognize the voice of the Spirit will be prepared to receive personal revelation to guide them throughout their lives. Help them understand that there are many ways the Holy Ghost can speak to us.\nPossible Activities\nHelp the children think of different ways we could talk to a friend who lives far away, such as writing a letter, sending an email, or talking on the phone. Teach them that Heavenly Father can speak to us in different ways through the Holy Ghost. Use President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “\nHow Does Heavenly Father Speak to Us?\n” to help the children understand the different ways the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds and hearts (\nFriend\n, Mar. 2020, 2–3, or\nLiahona\n, Mar. 2020, F2–F3).\nShare an experience when the Holy Ghost communicated with you, either through thoughts in your mind or through a feeling in your heart (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n8:2–3\n; see also Henry B. Eyring, “\nOpen Your Heart to the Holy Ghost\n,”\nFriend\n, Aug. 2019, 2–3, or\nLiahona\n, Aug. 2019, F2–F3). Testify to the children that the Holy Ghost can help them in similar ways.\nHelp the children recognize times when they are feeling the Spirit—for example, when singing a song about the Savior or when doing something kind for others. Help them recognize the spiritual feelings that the Holy Ghost brings, especially His promptings to act. Why do you think the Holy Ghost gives us these feelings? Help the children think of things that we need to do to hear the Holy Ghost speak to us. Talk about what you do to hear the Spirit more clearly.\nThe Sacrament\nWhen I take the sacrament, I remember the Savior’s sacrifice and renew my covenants.\nThe Savior gave us the sacrament to help us remember His sacrifice for us and renew our covenants.\nTo learn more, see\nMatthew 26:26–30\n;\n3 Nephi 18:1–12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n.\nPossible Activities\nInvite the children to color “\nJesus Introduced the Sacrament to the Nephites\n” in\nScripture Stories Coloring Book: Book of Mormon\n(2019), 26. Ask them to point to what the people are thinking about in the picture. Read to the children portions of\n3 Nephi 18:1–12\nor “\nChapter 45: Jesus Christ Teaches about the Sacrament and Prayer\n,” in\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 126–27 (or watch the corresponding video in Gospel Library). What can we do to remember Jesus Christ during the sacrament?\nJesus Shares the Sacrament\nAsk the children to tell you some things they should always remember to do, such as tying their shoes or washing their hands before they eat. Why is it important to remember these things? Read\nMoroni 4:3\nto the children, and invite them to listen for what we promise to always remember when we take the sacrament. Why is it important to remember Jesus Christ? Help the children understand how the bread and water of the sacrament help us remember what Jesus has done for us (see\nMoroni 4:3\n;\n5:2\n).\nWrite on the board “I promise to …” Read the sacrament prayers to the children (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n). When they hear a promise we make to God, pause and help them complete the sentence on the board with the promise they heard. Help them understand that when we take the sacrament, we are making the same promises we made at baptism.\nWhat does it mean to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ? To help the children answer this question, share an example of something that we put our names on. Why do we put our names on these things? Why would Jesus Christ want to put His name upon us? Consider sharing this explanation from President Russell M. Nelson: “Taking the Savior’s name upon us includes declaring and witnessing to others—through our actions and our words—that Jesus is the Christ” (“\nThe Correct Name of the Church\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 88).\nPriesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nGod blesses His children through priesthood power.\nAll of God’s children—female and male, young and old—receive God’s power as they keep the covenants they have made with Him. We make these covenants when we receive priesthood ordinances such as baptism (see\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n3.5\n,\n3.6\n, Gospel Library). To learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; “\nPriesthood Principles\n,”\nchapter 3\nin\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nPossible Activities\nHelp the children notice the blessings they receive because of the priesthood. To give them some ideas, you could show the video “Blessings of the Priesthood” (Gospel Library). Consider listing these blessings on the board. Why are these blessings important to us? Testify that these blessings come to us because of Jesus Christ and His priesthood power.\nBlessings of the Priesthood\nHelp the children find pictures that illustrate how God uses His power to bless us. For example, they could find a picture of the world He created for us, examples of healing the sick, and sacred ordinances He has provided for us (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n3\n,\n46\n,\n104\n,\n105\n,\n107\n,\n120\n). Share why you are grateful for the priesthood and the blessings it brings. Help the children think of experiences when they were blessed by God’s priesthood power.\nOne of the main ways we receive the blessings of God’s power in our lives is through priesthood ordinances (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:20\n). To help the children learn this truth, you could list the following scriptures on the board:\n3 Nephi 11:21–26, 33\n(baptism);\nMoroni 2\n(confirmation);\nMoroni 4–5\n(sacrament). The children could each choose one of these passages and identify the ordinance it describes. Invite the children to share how they have been personally blessed by receiving priesthood ordinances.\nHelp the children understand that they will receive power from God as they are baptized and keep their baptismal covenant. Ask the children how this power could help them.\nGod’s work is directed by priesthood keys and accomplished by priesthood authority.\nWhenever a person is set apart for a calling or assigned to help in God’s work, she or he can exercise delegated priesthood authority. In addition, worthy male Church members can be ordained to an office in the priesthood. The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by individuals who hold priesthood keys, such as the stake president, the bishop, and quorum presidents. Priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood in doing the work of the Lord.\nPossible Activities\nRead with the children\nMark 3:14–15\n, and show them a picture of the event described there (such as\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n38\n). Ask the children if they have ever seen someone be set apart for a calling or ordained to a priesthood office (or tell them about experiences you have had). How is that similar to what the Savior did with His Apostles? Help the children list on the board callings or priesthood offices that can be given to members of the Church, such as a teacher or leader in an organization. Next to each calling or office, you could write what someone with that calling or office has the authority to do. Tell the children how being set apart by someone with the direction of priesthood keys has helped you serve.\nInvite the children to think of something that you need a key for, such as a car or a door. What happens if you don’t have the key? Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 65:2\n, and share your testimony about the importance of having priesthood keys. You could also watch the video “Where Are the Keys?” (Gospel Library) and look for what Elder Gary E. Stevenson teaches about priesthood keys.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nThe Temple and the Plan of Happiness\nThe temple is the house of the Lord.\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Him, are endowed with priesthood power, receive revelation, perform ordinances for our deceased ancestors, and are sealed to our families for eternity. All of this is possible because of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.\nHow can you help the children you teach recognize the sacredness of the Lord’s house and prepare themselves to be worthy to participate in temple ordinances? Consider reviewing these resources:\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:15–17\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nClosing Remarks\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 120–22; “\nWhy Latter-day Saints Build Temples\n,”\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children.\nPossible Activities\nDisplay one or more pictures of temples. Ask the children what makes the temple a special place. Point out that on each temple is this inscription: “Holiness to the Lord—The House of the Lord.” Ask the children what they think “Holiness to the Lord” might mean. Why is the temple called the house of the Lord? What does this teach us about the temple? If any of the children have been to a temple, they could also share how they felt when they were there. If you have been to the temple, share how you have felt the Lord’s presence there, and talk about why the temple is a sacred place to you.\nRead together\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:15–17\n. Ask the children to look for what the Lord expects of people who enter His holy house. Why do we need to be worthy to enter His house? As part of this conversation, talk to the children about temple recommends, including how to receive one. You could invite a member of the bishopric to share with them what a temple recommend interview is like and the questions that are asked in one.\nIn the temple, we make covenants with God.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “Jesus Christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our Heavenly Parents and be with those we love” (“\nCome, Follow Me\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 91). Help the children understand that the covenant path includes baptism, confirmation, and the temple endowment and sealing.\nPossible Activities\nAsk the children to help you review the covenant that we make with God when we are baptized and that we renew when we partake of the sacrament (see\nMosiah 18:10\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n). Show a picture of the temple, and explain that Heavenly Father has more blessings He wants to give us in the temple.\nDraw a gate leading to a path. Ask the children why they think it is helpful to have a path to walk on. Read together\n2 Nephi 31:17–20\n, where Nephi compares the covenant of baptism to a gate and invites us to continue on the path after baptism. There are more covenants to make after baptism, including covenants made in the temple. Explain that President Nelson has called this path the “covenant path.”\nIn the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed for ancestors who have died.\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for all of God’s children to return to live with Him, even if they die without knowing the gospel. In the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ on their behalf.\nPossible Activities\nTalk about a time when someone did something for you that you could not do for yourself. Invite the children to share similar experiences. Explain that when we go to the temple, we can receive sacred ordinances such as baptism for others who have died. How are we being like Jesus when we are doing work for the dead? What has He done for us that we couldn’t do for ourselves?\nInvite one or more youth who have been baptized for their ancestors to share their experience. Ask them what it was like in the temple. Encourage them to share how they felt doing this work for their ancestors.\nDraw a tree on the board, including the roots and branches. Ask the children to think of how a family is like a tree. Label the roots\nAncestors\n, label the branches\nDescendants\n, and label the trunk of the tree\nYou\n. Read together this sentence from\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\n: “For we without them [our ancestors] cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.” Ask questions like the following: “Why do we need our ancestors? Why do our ancestors need us? How have our parents, grandparents, and other ancestors helped us?” Invite the children to search the rest of\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\nfor a phrase that describes how we can help our ancestors.\nConsider working with the parents of each child to find the name of an ancestor who needs ordinances in the temple (see\nFamilySearch.org\n)."

As children sing about gospel principles, the Holy Ghost will testify of their truthfulness. The words and music will stay in the children’s minds and hearts throughout their lives.\nSeek the help of the Spirit as you prepare to teach the gospel through music. Share your testimony of the truths you sing about. Help the children see how the music relates to what they are learning and experiencing at home and in Primary classes.\nGuidelines for the Sacrament Meeting Presentation\nWith the direction of the bishop, the children’s sacrament meeting presentation is normally held during the fourth quarter of the year. As the Primary presidency and music leader, work with the counselor in the bishopric who oversees Primary to plan the presentation.\nThe presentation should allow the children to present what they and their families have learned from the Doctrine and Covenants at home and in Primary, including the Primary songs they have sung during the year.

The following ideas can inspire you as you plan ways to teach the gospel principles found in hymns and Primary songs.\nRead related scriptures.\nFor many of the songs in the\nChildren’s Songbook\nand the hymnbook, references to related scriptures are listed. Help the children read some of these passages, and talk about how the scriptures are related to the song. You could also list a few scripture references on the board and invite the children to match each reference to a song or a verse from a song.\nFill in the blank.\nWrite a verse of the song on the board with several key words missing. Then ask the children to sing the song, listening for the words that fill in the blanks. As they fill in each blank, discuss what gospel principles you learn from the missing words.\nTestify.\nBear brief testimony to the children of gospel truths found in the Primary song. Help the children understand that singing is one way they can bear testimony and feel the Spirit.\nStand as a witness.\nInvite children to take turns standing and sharing what they learn from the song they are singing or how they feel about the truths taught in the song. Ask them how they feel as they sing the song, and help them identify the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nUse pictures.\nAsk the children to help you find or create pictures that go with important words or phrases in the song. Invite them to share how the pictures relate to the song and what the song teaches. For example, if you are teaching the song “\nWhen He Comes Again\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 82–83), you could place pictures throughout the room that depict important words from the song (such as\nangels\n,\nsnow\n, and\nstar\n). Ask the children to gather the pictures and hold them up in the correct order as you sing the song together.\nShare an object lesson.\nYou could use an object to inspire discussion about a song. For example, when singing the song “\n‘Give,’ Said the Little Stream\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 236), you could show the children a picture of things like a stream, grass, rain, and flowers. This could lead to a discussion about how even small acts of service can bless others in important ways.\nInvite sharing of personal experiences.\nHelp the children connect the principles taught in the song with experiences they have had with these principles. For example, before singing “\nI Love to See the Temple\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 95), you could ask the children to raise their hands if they have seen a temple. Invite them, as they sing, to think about how they feel when they see a temple.\nAsk questions.\nThere are many questions you can ask as you sing songs. For example, you can ask the children what they learn from each verse in the song. You can also ask them to think of questions that the song answers. This can lead to a discussion about the truths taught in the song.\nUse simple hand actions.\nInvite the children to think of simple hand actions to help them remember the words and messages of a song. For example, when you sing “\nSearch, Ponder, and Pray\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 109), you could invite the children to point to their eyes as they sing about searching the scriptures, point to their heads as they sing about pondering, and fold their arms as they sing about praying."
