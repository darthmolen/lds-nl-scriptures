      "plain_text": "“Conversion Is Our Goal,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\nConversion Is Our Goal\nThe aim of all gospel learning and teaching is to deepen our conversion and help us become more like Jesus Christ. For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond the classroom into an individual’s heart and home. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. True conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers in us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."

        "Come, Follow Me is for anyone who wants to learn from the scriptures—individually, as a family, and in Church classes. If you haven’t studied the scriptures regularly in the past, this resource can help you get started. If you already have a good habit of scripture study, this resource can help you have more meaningful experiences.",
        "The ideal place to learn the gospel is the home. Your teachers at church can support you, and you can get encouragement from other ward members. But to survive spiritually, you and your family need daily nourishment from “the good word of God” ( Moroni 6:4 ; see also Russell M. Nelson, “ Opening Remarks ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 6–8).",
        "Use this resource in any way that is helpful to you. The outlines highlight some eternal truths found in the Old Testament. They also suggest ideas and activities to help you study the scriptures individually, with your family, or with friends. As you study, follow the Spirit’s guidance to find eternal truths that are meaningful to you. Look for God’s messages for you, and follow the promptings you receive.",
        "Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church is the curriculum for Sunday classes in Primary, youth and adult Sunday School, Young Women classes, and Aaronic Priesthood quorum meetings. If you teach in any of these settings, you are encouraged to use the outlines in this resource for your personal study and as you prepare to teach. Start by having your own experiences in the scriptures. Your most important preparation will occur as you search the scriptures and seek the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Look for eternal truths that help you become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Come, Follow Me can help you identify some of these truths and understand the context of the scriptures.",
        "Keep in mind that learning the gospel, at its best, is home centered and Church supported. In other words, your main responsibility is to support the people you teach in their efforts to learn and live the gospel at home. Don’t worry about having unique content to provide for them in class. Instead, give them opportunities to share their experiences, thoughts, and questions about the scripture passages they’ve read at home. Invite them to share the eternal truths they have found. This is more important than covering a certain amount of material.",
        "One main reason we gather in Sunday School classes is to support and encourage one another as we strive to follow Jesus Christ. A simple way to do this is to ask a question like “What has the Holy Ghost taught you this week as you studied the scriptures?” Answers to this question could lead to meaningful discussions that build faith in Jesus Christ and His gospel.",
        "Then you could invite discussion based on the study suggestions in Come, Follow Me . For instance, a study idea might suggest searching Isaiah 53 , looking for words that describe the Savior’s mission. You might ask class members to share any thoughts or feelings that these words inspired for them. Or you could spend some time looking for these words as a class.",
        "When Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes meet on Sundays, their purpose is somewhat different from a Sunday School class. In addition to helping each other learn the gospel of Jesus Christ, these groups also meet to counsel together about accomplishing the work of salvation and exaltation (see General Handbook , 1.2 ). They do this with the direction of class and quorum presidencies.",
        "For this reason, each quorum or class meeting should begin with a member of the quorum or class presidency leading a discussion about efforts to, for example, live the gospel, minister to people in need, share the gospel, or participate in temple and family history work.",
        "After this time for counseling together, an instructor leads the class or quorum in learning the gospel together. Adult leaders or members of the class or quorum can be assigned to teach. The class or quorum presidency, consulting with adult leaders, makes these assignments.",

As you do, be open to spiritual impressions and insights from the Holy Ghost about the children in your Primary class. Be prayerful, and the Spirit can inspire you with ideas to help them learn the gospel of Jesus Christ.",

Each outline in this resource has a section titled “Ideas for Teaching Children.” Think of these ideas as suggestions to spark your inspiration. You know the children in your Primary class—and you will get to know them even better as you interact with them in class. God knows them too, and He will inspire you with the best ways to teach and bless them.",
        "It’s possible that children in your class will have already done some of the activities in Come, Follow Me with their families. That’s OK. Repetition is good. Consider inviting the children to share with each other what they learned at home—though you should also plan ways for children to participate even if they aren’t learning at home. Children learn gospel truths more effectively when these truths are taught repeatedly through a variety of activities. If you find that a learning activity is effective for the children, consider repeating it, especially if you are teaching younger children. You might also review an activity from a previous lesson.",

Sometimes truths about the Savior and His gospel are stated directly, and sometimes they are implied through an example or story. Ask yourself, “What eternal truths are taught in these verses? What do these truths teach me about the Savior?”\nListen to the Spirit\nPay attention to your thoughts and feelings, even if they are unrelated to what you are reading. These impressions may be what your Heavenly Father wants you to learn.\nRecord your impressions\nThere are many ways to record the impressions that come as you study. For example, you may find that certain words and phrases in the scriptures impress you; you could mark them and record your thoughts as a note in your scriptures. You could also keep a journal of the insights, feelings, and impressions you receive.\nShare what you’re learning with others\nDiscussing insights from your personal study is a good way to teach others, and it also helps strengthen your understanding of what you have read. Share what you’re learning with family members and friends (in person or digitally), and invite them to do the same.\nRelate the scriptures to your life\nConsider how the stories and teachings you are reading apply to your life. For example, you could ask yourself, “What experiences have I had that are similar to what I am reading?”\nAsk questions as you study\nAs you study the scriptures, questions may come to mind. These questions might relate to what you are reading or to your life in general. Ponder these questions and look for answers as you continue studying the scriptures.\nUse scripture study helps\nTo gain additional insights into the verses you read, use the footnotes, the\nTopical Guide\n, the\nBible Dictionary\n, the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n, and other study helps.\nConsider the context of the scriptures\nYou can find meaningful insights about a scripture passage as you consider its context, including the circumstances or setting it came from. For example, knowing the background and beliefs of the people God spoke to can help you better understand the intent of His words.\nStudy the words of latter-day prophets and apostles\nRead what latter-day prophets and apostles have taught about the principles you find in the scriptures.\nLive by what you learn\nScripture study should not only inspire us but also lead us to change the way we live. Listen to what the Spirit prompts you to do as you read, and then act on these promptings.\nUse music\nSuggested hymns and children’s songs are found throughout\nCome, Follow Me\n. Use sacred music to invite the Spirit and to deepen your faith and testimony of gospel truths.\nMemorize scriptures\nSelect a scripture passage that is meaningful to you, your family, or your class, and memorize it by repeating it daily or by playing a memorization game.\nShare object lessons\nFind objects that relate to the chapters and verses that you are reading. Consider how each object relates to the teachings in the scriptures.\nDraw, find, or take a picture\nRead a few verses, and then draw something that relates to what you read. Or you could look for a picture in the\nGospel Art Book\nor elsewhere in Gospel Library. You could also take a picture that illustrates what you learned.\nDramatize a story\nAfter reading a story, invite family or class members to act it out. Afterward, talk about how the story relates to the things that you are experiencing.\nBe flexible at home\nIf you have family members who aren’t willing to participate in family scripture study, look for other ways to connect with them. For example, could you share eternal truth naturally in your conversations or share a meaningful scripture in a way that doesn’t seem preachy or overbearing? Scripture study doesn’t have to look the same in every family. Some children may respond better to studying the scriptures one on one.

Genesis is an example of this, and so are books like Joshua, Judges, and 1 and 2 Kings. But other Old Testament writers did not aim to be historical at all. Instead, they taught through works of art like poetry and literature. The Psalms and the Proverbs fit in this category.

        "When the leaders of the Jews challenged Jesus about His identity, He declared, “Before Abraham was, I am.” These words shocked the people who heard Jesus, and they were ready to stone Him (see John 8:58–59 ). Consider reading Exodus 3:13–15 ; 6:3–5 to see why some Jews were so upset at what Jesus said.",
        "Why is it significant to you to know that Jesus Christ is Jehovah?",

Consider reading 1 Nephi 13:21–29, 38–42 , looking for how the Lord planned to “make known the plain and precious things.” According to 2 Nephi 3:12 , how do the Bible and Book of Mormon work together?",

Why are these accounts “plain and precious” to you?",
        "The Old Testament is the story of God seeking to make us His “peculiar treasure” by covenant ( Exodus 19:5 ). For that reason, a good way to prepare to read the Old Testament is to learn about covenants—specifically the everlasting covenant God offered to ancient prophets like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their posterity. And a great way to learn about covenants is to study President Russell M. Nelson’s message “ The Everlasting Covenant ” ( Liahona , October 2022, 4–11).",

The First Testament of Jesus Christ: Introduction to the Old Testament,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“Introduction to the Old Testament,”\nCome, Follow Me: 2026\nDecember 29–January 4: The First Testament of Jesus Christ\nIntroduction to the Old Testament\nWhen you consider studying the Old Testament this year, how do you feel? Eager? Uncertain? Afraid? All of these emotions are understandable. The Old Testament is one of the oldest collections of writings in the world, and this can make it both exciting and intimidating. These writings come from an ancient culture that can seem foreign and sometimes strange or even uncomfortable. And yet in these writings we see people having experiences that seem familiar. We recognize gospel themes that witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and His gospel. Yes, people like Abraham, Sarah, Hannah, and Daniel lived lives that, in some ways, were very different from ours. But they also experienced family joy and family discord, moments of faith and moments of uncertainty, and successes and failures—like all of us do. More important, they exercised faith, repented, made covenants, had spiritual experiences, and never gave up on the promise of a Savior. As we learn how God moved in their lives, we also see Him in ours, and we say with the psalmist: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. … Therefore thy servant loveth it” (\nPsalm 119:105, 140\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and Church\nThe Old Testament testifies of Jesus Christ.\nOne way to find rich spiritual nourishment in the Old Testament is to look for the Bread of Life, Jesus Christ (see\nJohn 6:48\n). For example, how do you see the Savior in the following?\nManna (\nExodus 16:4, 11–15\n;\nJohn 6:35\n)\nThe sacrificial lamb (\nExodus 12:3–5\n;\nJohn 1:29\n)\nThe brass serpent (\nNumbers 21:4–10\n;\nJohn 3:14\n)\nJonah (\nJonah 1:4–17\n;\nMatthew 12:38–41\n)\nWhat do these examples teach about Him? What other references to Jesus Christ in the Old Testament are you already familiar with?\nIn his message “\nJesus Christ Is the Treasure\n,” Elder Dale G. Renlund encouraged us to “remember and always focus on Jesus Christ” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 98). Consider reading his message, looking for things you can do to find Jesus Christ not only in the Old Testament but also in your life.\nSee also “\nTypes or Symbols of Christ\n” in Guide to the Scriptures, “\nJesus Christ\n,” Gospel Library; “\nSeek the Lord Early\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 108.\nLook for symbols that testify of Jesus Christ.\nThe Lord taught Adam, “All things have their likeness, and all things are created and made to bear record of me” (\nMoses 6:63\n). Whether you are studying or teaching, focusing on Jesus Christ can help you find meaning in the scriptures and increase your love for and faith in Him. (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n.)\nJesus Christ is Jehovah in the Old Testament.\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks taught: “The Father introduced His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, as our Savior and Redeemer and gave us the command to ‘hear Him.’ From this direction we conclude that the scriptural records of words spoken by ‘God’ or the ‘Lord’ are almost always the words of Jehovah, our risen Lord, Jesus Christ” (“\nThe Teachings of Jesus Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 102).\nThe Teachings of Jesus Christ\nWhen the leaders of the Jews challenged Jesus about His identity, He declared, “Before Abraham was, I am.” These words shocked the people who heard Jesus, and they were ready to stone Him (see\nJohn 8:58–59\n). Consider reading\nExodus 3:13–15\n;\n6:3–5\nto see why some Jews were so upset at what Jesus said.\nWhy is it significant to you to know that Jesus Christ is Jehovah?\nThe Lord restored many “plain and precious things” through Joseph Smith.\nIn a vision, the Lord showed Nephi the coming forth of the Bible, explaining that “many plain and precious things” would be taken from it. Consider reading\n1 Nephi 13:21–29, 38–42\n, looking for how the Lord planned to “make known the plain and precious things.” According to\n2 Nephi 3:12\n, how do the Bible and Book of Mormon work together?\nAs you study the Old Testament this year, you will also study some of the “other books” Nephi foresaw. These include:\nThe book of Moses\n, part of Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible. It restores truths and accounts not found in the current text of\nGenesis 1–6\n.\nThe book of Abraham\n, which was revealed to Joseph Smith as he examined ancient Egyptian papyri (see Topics and Questions, “\nBook of Abraham\n,” Gospel Library).\nVarious passages from the Joseph Smith Translation\n, some of which appear in the footnotes, the appendix of the Bible, and the Guide to the Scriptures.\nHere are some examples of Old Testament accounts restored through Joseph Smith: Enoch’s city of Zion (\nMoses 7:18–19\n), Abraham’s vision of the council in heaven (\nAbraham 3:22–28\n), and the ministry of Melchizedek (\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:25–40\n).

And a great way to learn about covenants is to study President Russell M.

As you read the Old Testament this year, be watching for things God wants to teach you about your covenant relationship with Him.\nSee also\nJeremiah 31:31–34\n.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nI can learn of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament.\nThe words and culture of the Old Testament may be difficult for children to understand, but you can help them see Jesus Christ in symbols and stories.

        "“If the Lord were speaking to you directly,” President Russell M. Nelson taught, “the first thing He would make sure you understand is your true identity” (“ Choices for Eternity ” [worldwide devotional for young adults, May 2022], Gospel Library). It follows that Satan would try to confuse you on that same point. Look for this pattern in God’s message to Moses in Moses 1:4, 6 and in Satan’s messages in Moses 1:12 . What do you learn from these verses about the differences between God and Satan?",
        "President Nelson also taught, “The way you think about who you really are affects almost every decision you will ever make” (“ Choices for Eternity ”). Consider making a list of choices you make because your identity as a child of God comes before other labels.",
        "What additional verses or phrases in Moses 1 help you understand your divine worth? You might also read more of President Nelson’s message in the section of “Choices for Eternity” titled “ First: Know the truth about who you are. ” What do you feel inspired to do to make your identity as a child of God your most important identifier?",
        "See also “ I Am a Child of God ,” Hymns (1985), no. 301; “ Our True Identity ” (video), Gospel Library; Topics and Questions, “ Children of God ,” Gospel Library.",
        "As Moses 1 clearly shows, powerful spiritual experiences do not mean we’ll never be tempted again. In fact, one of Satan’s tactics is to tempt us to doubt these experiences. As you read Moses’s response to Satan in verses 12–26 , what do you learn that can help you stay true to the testimony you have received? What was it that finally helped Moses overcome Satan?",
        "Another lesson from Moses’s experience is that Satan tempts us with counterfeits of God’s truth and power. Think of some fake versions of things, such as an artificial plant or a baby doll. How can you tell they’re fake? Then consider the counterfeits Satan uses today to tempt you. What do you learn from Moses 1:13–18 about how to recognize and reject his counterfeits? How can the Lord help you? (see Moses 1:24–26 ).",
        "See also Matthew 4:1–11 ; Gary E. Stevenson, “ Deceive Me Not ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2019, 93–96; “I Am a Son of God” (video), Gospel Library.",
        "After seeing a vision of God’s creations, Moses said to the Lord: “Tell me … why these things are so” ( Moses 1:30 ). What impresses you about the Lord’s response in Moses 1:31–39 ? What’s the difference between immortality and eternal life? (see Topics and Questions, “ Eternal Life ,” Gospel Library). How does Jesus Christ help bring to pass both? Abraham also had a vision, recorded in Abraham 3 . What do you find in verses 24–26 that could help answer Moses’s request?",
        "We know very little about our premortal life. But much of what we do know comes from Abraham’s vision in Abraham 3:22–28 . As you read these verses, make a list of truths you find—including truths about yourself and about Jesus Christ. Why are these truths valuable to you? What difference do they make in your life?",

But what was there\nbefore\nthis “beginning”? And\nwhy\ndid God create all of this? Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has shed light on these questions.\nFor example, He gave us the record of a vision in which Abraham saw our existence as spirits “before the world was” (see\nAbraham 3:22–28\n). The Lord also gave us an inspired translation or revision of the first six chapters of Genesis, called the book of Moses—which doesn’t begin with “in the beginning.” Instead, it begins with an experience Moses had that provides some context for the Creation story. Together, these latter-day scriptures are a good place to start our study of the Old Testament because they address some fundamental questions that can frame our reading: Who is God? Who are we? What is God’s work, and what is our place in it? The opening chapters of Genesis could be seen as the Lord’s response to Moses’s request: “Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens” (\nMoses 1:36\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMoses 1\nAs a child of God, I have a divine destiny.\n“If the Lord were speaking to you directly,” President Russell M.

One thing the Creation story teaches us is that God can, over time, make something magnificent out of something unorganized. That’s helpful to remember when life seems chaotic. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are Creators, and Their creative work with us is not finished. They can make light shine in dark moments in our lives. They can fill our emptiness with life. They can transform us into the divine beings we were meant to be. That’s what it means to be created in God’s image, after His likeness (see\nGenesis 1:26\n).

You could take them on a search outside for the kinds of things that were made during each period of Creation. Your children might also look at pictures of things Jesus created (see “\nThe Creation of the Earth\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 8–12). Then you and your children could talk about how you feel about Jesus Christ after reading about the Creation.\nThe Creation of the Earth\nConsider singing a song together about our beautiful world, such as “\nMy Heavenly Father Loves Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 228–29). Maybe your children could add to the song other things God has created that help them feel His love.\nHelp children express their creativity.\n“When you invite children to draw, build, color, or write something related to a gospel principle, you help them better understand the principle and you give them a tangible reminder of what they have learned” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n).\nGenesis 1:26–27\n;\nMoses 2:26–27\n;\nAbraham 4:26–27\nI was created in God’s image.\nYour children can develop a sense of reverence and respect for their own and others’ bodies as they learn that we were all created in God’s image. To help them understand what this means, you could let your children look at their image in a mirror or picture while you read\nMoses 2:26–27\nto them. You could also show them how baby animals are often in the “likeness” of their parents (see the picture in this outline, for example). This could lead to a conversation about why it’s important to you to know that you are created in your Heavenly Father’s image.\nYou and your children might enjoy drawing a human body and cutting the drawings into puzzles. As your children put their puzzles together, they could talk about ways they can show Heavenly Father that they are thankful for their bodies.\nGenesis 2:2–3\n;\nMoses 3:2–3\n;\nAbraham 5:2–3\nThe Sabbath day is holy.\nAs you read\nMoses 3:2–3\n, ask your children to listen for what God did on the seventh day. Help your children find or draw pictures of things they can do on Sunday to make it a holy day and different from other days. Share with each other why it is important to you to keep the Sabbath day holy.\nHelp your children role-play explaining to a friend why they choose to do things on Sunday that honor Heavenly Father and Jesus. Suggest that they use\nGenesis 2:2–3\nin their explanations. How does keeping the Sabbath day holy show our love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe Creation\n, by Annie Henrie Nader\nOpen PDF"

The Fall of Adam and Eve,”\nCome, Follow Me: 2026\nAdam and Eve\n, by Douglas M. Fryer\nJanuary 19–25: The Fall of Adam and Eve\nGenesis 3–4\n;\nMoses 4–5\nAt first, the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve might seem like a tragedy. Adam and Eve were cast out of the beautiful Garden of Eden. They were sent into a world of pain, sorrow, and death (see\nGenesis 3:16–19\n). And they were separated from their Heavenly Father. But the truths restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith in the book of Moses give us a unique perspective on the Fall.\nYes, the Garden of Eden was beautiful. But Adam and Eve needed more than beautiful surroundings. They needed—and we all need—an opportunity to grow. Leaving the Garden of Eden was the necessary first step toward returning to God and eventually becoming like Him. That meant facing opposition, making choices, making mistakes, learning to repent, and trusting the Savior, whose Atonement makes possible progression and “the joy of our redemption” (\nMoses 5:11\n). So when you read about the Fall of Adam and Eve, focus not on the seeming tragedy but on the possibilities—not on the paradise Adam and Eve lost but on the glory their choice allows us to receive.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 3\n;\nMoses 4\nThe Fall was a necessary part of God’s plan.\nIt’s true that Adam and Eve’s choice led to many of the difficulties we experience in mortality. But that doesn’t mean we regret their choice. As you read\nGenesis 3\nand\nMoses 4\n, you might ask yourself, why was the Fall important to God’s plan?\nAccording to\nMoses 5:9–12\n, how did Adam and Eve feel about the Fall? How can you apply their words to your experiences in this fallen world? What else do you learn from\n2 Nephi 2:19–25\n?\nSee also\nMosiah 3:19\n;\nAlma 12:21–37\n; and\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:39–43\n.\nLeaving Eden\n, by Annie Henrie Nader\nGenesis 3:1–7\n;\nMoses 4:22–31\n;\n5:4–15\nJesus Christ offers hope and redemption.\nAdam and Eve’s story is one of hope and redemption through Jesus Christ. To see why, you might start by searching for the results of the Fall in\nGenesis 3:1–7\n;\nMoses 4:22–31\nand marking or listing what you find. How do these results affect you? Then you could search\nMoses 5:4–15\n, looking for God’s plan to redeem us from these effects. Why were Adam and Eve “glad” after the angel visited them? What do you learn from them about Heavenly Father’s plan?\nSee also “Because of Him” (video), Gospel Library.\nBecause of Him\nGenesis 3:16\n;\nMoses 4:22\nWhat does it mean that Adam was to “rule over” Eve?\nThis passage of scripture has sometimes been misunderstood to mean that a husband is justified in treating his wife unkindly. In our day, the Lord’s prophets have taught that a husband and wife should see each other as equal partners in fulfilling their divine responsibilities in the family (see “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” [Gospel Library]). Elder Dale G. Renlund and Sister Ruth Lybbert Renlund explained that a righteous husband “will seek to minister; he will acknowledge error and seek forgiveness; he will be quick to offer praise; he will be considerate of family members’ preferences; he will feel the great weight of responsibility to provide ‘the necessities of life and protection’ for his family; he will treat his wife with the utmost respect and deference. … He will bless his family” (\nThe Melchizedek Priesthood: Understanding the Doctrine, Living the Principles\n[2018], 23).\nTo learn more about how the Lord views the relationship between husbands and wives, ponder the counsel of Elder Ulisses Soares in the following video. How would you explain, in your own words, what it means for husband wife to be “equal partners”?\nEqual Partnership in Marriage\nMoses 4:1–4\nI need agency and opposition to grow.\nElder Dale G. Renlund taught, “Our Heavenly Father’s goal in parenting is not to have His children\ndo\nwhat is right; it is to have His children\nchoose\nto do what is right and ultimately become like Him” (“\nChoose You This Day\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 104). Why is it so important in Heavenly Father’s plan that we\nchoose\nto do what is right?\nAs you read\nMoses 4:1–4\n, look for what Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ did to protect your right to choose—your agency. How can you access their protecting power? For ideas, consider studying the section “\nMake inspired choices\n” in\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n(4–5).\nConsider also reading what Lehi taught about agency in\n2 Nephi 2:11–20, 25–30\n. Why is opposition necessary for agency? How can you show your appreciation to Jesus Christ for making you “free to choose”? (\n2 Nephi 2:27\n).\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nOpposition in All Things\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 114–17; Topics and Questions, “\nAgency\n,” Gospel Library; “\nChoose the Right\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 239.\nIncrease participation.\nMany learning activities can be done as an individual, family, or class; in small groups; or in pairs. Use a variety of methods to allow people to participate who might not otherwise have a chance. For this activity, you could invite one person or group to read\nMoses 4\nand the\nFor the Strength of Youth\nguide while another group studies the verses in\n2 Nephi 2\n. They could then teach each other what they learned in their respective section.\nMoses 4:4–12\n;\n5:13–33\nSatan seeks “to deceive and to blind” me.\nAs you read\nMoses 4:4–12\n;\n5:13–33\n, consider listing ways that Satan tried to tempt Adam and Eve and their children. How does he attempt these same things today? How does Heavenly Father help you resist Satan’s deceptions?\nMoses 4:13–16, 27\n“I, the Lord God … clothed them.”\nAfter partaking of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve tried to cover their own nakedness. Later, the Lord offered to clothe them. As you read\nMoses 4:13–16, 27\n, consider the following:\nPonder what nakedness and clothing can represent in the scriptures (see, for example,\nRevelation 7:9, 13–15\n;\n2 Nephi 9:14\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 109:22–26, 76\n). What do you learn from Adam and Eve’s experience with nakedness and clothing?\nIf you have been endowed in the temple, consider what Adam and Eve might say to you about the significance of your temple garment and what it represents.\nSee also “Sacred Temple Clothing” (video), Gospel Library.\nSacred Temple Clothing\nMoses 5:4–9, 16–26\nGod will accept my sacrifices if I offer them with a willing and obedient heart.\nAs you study\nMoses 5:4–9, 16–26\n, consider the attitudes of Adam and Eve and their sons Cain and Abel toward sacrifice. Why did the Lord accept Abel’s sacrifice but not Cain’s?\nWhat does the Lord ask you to sacrifice? Is there anything in these verses that shapes the way you think about those sacrifices?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nDid God give Adam and Eve conflicting commandments in the Garden of Eden?\nWas it a sin for Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit?\nWhat do we know about the curse and mark placed upon Cain?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 3\n;\nMoses 4\n;\n5:8–15\nJesus Christ saves us from the Fall.\nTo help your children better understand the Fall of Adam and Eve, you could copy the pictures from “\nAdam and Eve\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 13–16) and cut them out. Then you could work together to put the pictures in order as you discuss the experiences of Adam and Eve. As you do, talk about why it was important, in Heavenly Father’s plan, for Adam and Eve to leave the Garden of Eden.\nAdam and Eve\nYour children can feel gratitude for the Atonement of Jesus Christ as they understand how He overcomes the effects of the Fall. As you read together\nMoses 4:25\n;\n6:48\n;\nRomans 5:12\n;\n2 Nephi 2:22–23\n, help your children find ways to complete this sentence: “Because of the Fall, I …” Then, as you read together\nMoses 5:8–11, 14–15\n;\n6:59\n;\nAlma 11:42\n, they could complete this sentence: “Because of Jesus Christ, I …” Share with each other your gratitude for Jesus Christ.\nMoses 4:1–4\nI can choose the right.\nConsider a simple object lesson to introduce the principle of agency: invite your children to color this week’s activity page, but give them only one color to use. Why would it be better to have choices? You could then read together\nMoses 4:1–4\nand talk about why God wants us to be able to choose between right and wrong.

We read a lot of names, but we don’t learn much about them. Then we read this intriguing but unexplained line: “And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him” (\nGenesis 5:24\n). Surely there’s a story behind that verse! But without further explanation, the list of generations resumes.\nThankfully,\nMoses 6\nreveals the details of Enoch’s story—and it’s quite a story. We learn of Enoch’s humility, his insecurities, the potential God saw in him, and the great work he performed as God’s prophet. We also get a clearer picture of the family of Adam and Eve as it progressed through the generations. We read of Satan’s “great dominion” but also of parents who taught children “the ways of God” (\nMoses 6:15, 21\n). Especially precious is what we learn about the doctrine these parents taught: faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost (see\nMoses 6:50–52\n). That doctrine, like the priesthood that accompanies it, “was in the beginning [and] shall be in the end of the world also” (\nMoses 6:7\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMoses 6:26–36\nSin limits my ability to see, feel, and hear the things of God.\nAs you study\nMoses 6:26–36\n, what do you learn about the effects of sin? How have you seen these effects? What attributes did Enoch have that helped him overcome these effects? How did God bless him as a result?\nMoses 6:26–47\nGod calls me to do His work despite my weaknesses.\nIf you ever feel overwhelmed with what the Lord has called you to do, you aren’t alone. Even Enoch felt that way when the Lord called him to be a prophet. As you read\nMoses 6:26–36\n, look for why Enoch felt overwhelmed and what the Lord said to give him courage.\nIn\nverses 37–47\n, you could look for ways the Lord supported Enoch and empowered him to do His work (see also\nMoses 7:13\n). You might compare Enoch’s experience with that of other prophets who felt inadequate, such as Moses (see\nExodus 4:10–16\n), Jeremiah (see\nJeremiah 1:4–10\n), Nephi (see\n2 Nephi 33:1–4\n), and Moroni (see\nEther 12:23–29\n). What do you feel God wants you to learn from these scriptures about the work He has given you to do?\nA Seer Hath the Lord Raised Up (Moses 6:36)\n, by Eva Timothy\nMany modern-day apostles and prophets have expressed feelings similar to Enoch’s when they described how it felt to receive their calls. For example, see the testimony of Elder Ulisses Soares in “\nProphets Speak by the Power of the Holy Spirit\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 98–99).\nWhat can you learn from these prophets and apostles about your feelings of inadequacy? When have you felt the Savior help you when He asked you to do hard things? Consider writing down a few experiences in your future when you will need to rely on the Savior’s help. How can you approach these events with faith in Jesus Christ?\nThis year’s youth theme, “Walk with Me,” is based on\nMoses 6:34\n. Click\nhere\nfor music and other resources related to this theme. What does it mean to walk with the Savior? What will you do to accept His invitation to walk with Him?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nAbide in Me, and I in You; Therefore Walk with Me,\n”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 123–25; “\nI’ll Go Where You Want Me to Go\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 270.\nMoses 6:48–68\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ was taught from the beginning.\nBecause we have the book of Moses, we know that God has been teaching His children how to find redemption ever since Adam and Eve. As you study\nMoses 6:48–68\n, search for what we must know and do to be redeemed. Notice Adam’s question in\nverse 53\n. Have you ever wondered that? What do you learn from the Lord’s answer in\nverses 53–65\n? You might think of these verses as the Lord’s message at Adam’s baptismal service. What do you learn about baptism from His message? Why do you think He compared baptism to being “born again”? (\nverse 59\n). What can you do to continue to be “born again” throughout your life?\nLook for symbols.\nIn the scriptures, objects or events can often represent or symbolize spiritual truths, especially truths about the Savior (see\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n). These symbols can enrich your understanding of Him and His doctrine. For instance, what do you learn from the symbols of hearts and ears in\nMoses 6:27\n, eyes and clay in\nMoses 6:35\n, or water in\nMoses 6:59–60\n?\nMoses 6:51–62\n“Teach these things freely unto your children.”\nAfter teaching Adam truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in\nMoses 6:51–63\n, the Lord told Adam to teach them to future generations. Consider making a list of these truths. (It might help to divide the passage into smaller groups of verses, such as\nverses 51–52\n,\n53–57\n,\n58–60\n,\n61–63\n). Why are these truths valuable to today’s rising generation? What else can you learn from the Lord’s instructions to parents in\nMosiah 4:14–15\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:25–28\n;\n93:40–50\n?\nReading about the “book of remembrance” that Adam and Eve’s family kept may inspire you or your family to make your own book of remembrance. What do you feel the Lord would want you to include? Consider saving information from your book of remembrance on\nFamilySearch.org\n.\nSee also Dieter F.

As God’s people, we share this desire. We call it building Zion, and it includes—in addition to caring for people in need and promoting peace—making covenants, dwelling together in righteousness, and becoming one with each other and with Jesus Christ, “the King of Zion” (\nMoses 7:53\n). If the world, your community, or your family isn’t quite what you want it to be, it’s helpful to ask, How did Enoch and his people do it? How did they become “of one heart and one mind” (\nMoses 7:18\n) despite the contention around them? Among the many details\nMoses 7\ngives us about Zion, a particularly valuable one for Latter-day Saints might be this: Zion is not just a city—it is a condition of the heart and spirit. Zion, as the Lord has taught, is “the pure in heart” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:21\n). So perhaps the best way to build Zion is to start in our own hearts and homes.\nIdeas for Learning and Home and at Church\nMoses 7:16–21, 27, 53, 62–69\nI can help build Zion.\nWhen the Prophet Joseph Smith first learned about Enoch and his City of Holiness, he was inspired. He “knew the day had come when the Lord would again establish Zion on the earth” (\nSaints\n,\n1:108–9\n), and he started a lifelong quest to build Zion. Reading\nMoses 7\ncan inspire you to continue that effort today.\nYou might start by exploring the questions “What is Zion?” and “How is it different from the rest of the world?” Consider listing answers that come to you as you study\nMoses 7\n, in particular\nverses 16–21, 27, 53, 62–69\n.\nYour answers to these questions might make it clear that we still have a lot of work to do to build Zion. So how do we do it? It might help to think about times when you felt you were “of one heart and one mind” with someone (\nMoses 7:18\n). Maybe it was in a ward, family, or group at work or school. What did people do to create righteous unity?\nHere are some other resources that you could explore to find ideas and inspiration. Pick one or more to study, and then write down what you feel inspired to do to build Zion:\nPhilippians 2:1–4\n;\n4 Nephi 1:15–18\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:21\n;\n105:5\n.\nUlisses Soares, “\nBrothers and Sisters in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 70–73.\nD. Todd Christofferson, “\nOne in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 77–80.\n“We Come Together and Unite as One” (video), Gospel Library.\nWe Come Together & Unite As One\nGod wants His people to be “of one heart and one mind” (\nMoses 7:18\n).\nMoses 7:53\nJesus Christ is “the King of Zion.”\nWhat does it mean to you to have Jesus Christ as your King?

When Jesus Christ taught how we should watch for His Second Coming, He said, “As it was in the days of Noah, so it shall be also at the coming of the Son of Man” (\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:41\n). In addition, words that describe Noah’s day, like “corrupt” and “filled with violence,” could just as easily describe our time (\nGenesis 6:12–13\n;\nMoses 8:28\n). The story of the Tower of Babel also feels applicable to our day, with its description of pride followed by confusion and then division.\nThese ancient accounts are valuable not just because they show us that wickedness repeats itself throughout history. More important, they teach us what to do about it. Noah “found grace in the eyes of the Lord” (\nMoses 8:27\n). And the families of Jared and his brother turned to the Lord and were protected from the confusion and division in Babel (see\nEther 1:33–43\n).

        "Abraham wanted “to be a greater follower of righteousness” ( Abraham 1:2 ), so God invited him into a covenant relationship. Abraham wasn’t the first to have this desire, and he wasn’t the first to receive a covenant. It was, after all, an everlasting covenant. Abraham sought for “the blessings of the fathers” ( Abraham 1:2 )—blessings that were offered by covenant to Adam and Eve and thereafter to people who sought these blessings diligently.",
        "God’s covenant with Abraham promised wonderful blessings: an inheritance of land, a large posterity, access to priesthood ordinances, and a name that would be honored for generations to come. But the focus of this covenant was not just on the blessings Abraham and his family would receive but also on the blessing they would be to the rest of God’s children. “Thou shalt be a blessing,” God declared, “and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed” ( Genesis 12:2–3 ).",
        "Did this covenant give Abraham, Sarah, and their descendants a privileged status among God’s children? Only in the sense that it is a privilege to bless others. The family of Abraham were to “bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations,” sharing “the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal” ( Abraham 2:9, 11 ). Being God’s covenant people didn’t mean they were better than others; it meant they had a duty to help others be better.",
        "This covenant was the blessing Abraham was longing for. After receiving it, Abraham said in his heart, “Thy servant has sought thee earnestly; now I have found thee” ( Abraham 2:12 ).",
        "That was thousands of years ago, but this covenant has been restored in our day. And it is currently being fulfilled in the lives of God’s people. The fulfillment of the covenant is building momentum in the latter days as God’s work progresses, blessing families throughout the world. And anyone who, like Abraham, wants to be a greater follower of righteousness—anyone who seeks the Lord earnestly—can be a part of it.",
        "You are a child of the covenant. You make a covenant with God when you are baptized and when you partake of the sacrament. And you receive the fulness of the covenant with the sacred ordinances of the temple.",
        "Through these covenants and ordinances, we become God’s people. We are bound to Him “with everlasting ties.” “Once we make a covenant with God,” President Russell M. Nelson has taught, “we leave neutral ground forever. God will not abandon His relationship with those who have forged such a bond with Him. In fact, all those who have made a covenant with God have access to a special kind of love and mercy. … Because of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us.” You will see this in the history of God’s covenant people in the Old Testament, and you will see it in your own life as one of His covenant children.",
        "This is the precious understanding granted to us because of the Restoration of the Abrahamic covenant through the Prophet Joseph Smith. So when you read about covenants in the Old Testament, don’t think just about God’s relationship with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Think also about His relationship with you. When you read about the promise of numberless posterity, don’t think just about the millions who today call Abraham their father. Think also about God’s promise to you of eternal families and eternal increase. When you read about the promise of a land of inheritance, don’t think just about the land promised to Abraham. Think also about the celestial destiny of the earth itself—an inheritance promised to the “meek” who “wait upon the Lord” ( Matthew 5:5 ; Psalm 37:9, 11 ). And when you read about the promise that God’s covenant people will bless “all the families of the earth” ( Abraham 2:11 ), don’t think just about the ministry of Abraham or the prophets who descended from him. Think also about what you can do—as a covenant follower of Jesus Christ—to be a blessing to the families around you."

Today we usually think of covenants as sacred promises with God, but in the ancient world, covenants were also an important part of people’s interactions with each other. For their safety and survival, people needed to be able to trust each other, and covenants were a way to secure that trust.\nSo when God spoke to Enoch, Noah, Moses, and others about covenants, He was inviting them to enter into a relationship of trust with Him. We call this covenant the new and everlasting covenant\nor the Abrahamic covenant—a reference to the covenant God made with Abraham and Sarah and then renewed with their descendants Isaac and Jacob (also called Israel). In the Old Testament, it was known simply as “the covenant.” You will see that the Old Testament is fundamentally the story of people who saw themselves as the inheritors of this covenant—the covenant people.\nThe Abrahamic covenant continues to be important today, especially to Latter-day Saints. Why? Because we are also the covenant people, whether or not we are direct descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\nFor this reason, it is important to understand what the Abrahamic covenant is and how it applies to us today.\nWhat Is the Abrahamic Covenant?\nAbraham wanted “to be a greater follower of righteousness” (\nAbraham 1:2\n), so God invited him into a covenant relationship. Abraham wasn’t the first to have this desire, and he wasn’t the first to receive a covenant. It was, after all, an everlasting covenant. Abraham sought for “the blessings of the fathers” (\nAbraham 1:2\n)—blessings that were offered by covenant to Adam and Eve and thereafter to people who sought these blessings diligently.\nGod’s covenant with Abraham promised wonderful blessings: an inheritance of land, a large posterity, access to priesthood ordinances, and a name that would be honored for generations to come. But the focus of this covenant was not just on the blessings Abraham and his family would\nreceive\nbut also on the blessing they would\nbe\nto the rest of God’s children. “Thou shalt be a blessing,” God declared, “and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed” (\nGenesis 12:2–3\n).\nDid this covenant give Abraham, Sarah, and their descendants a privileged status among God’s children? Only in the sense that it is a privilege to bless others. The family of Abraham were to “bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations,” sharing “the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal” (\nAbraham 2:9, 11\n). Being God’s covenant people didn’t mean they were better than others; it meant they had a duty to help others be better.\nThis covenant was the blessing Abraham was longing for. After receiving it, Abraham said in his heart, “Thy servant has sought thee earnestly; now I have found thee” (\nAbraham 2:12\n).\nThat was thousands of years ago, but this covenant has been restored in our day.\nAnd it is currently being fulfilled in the lives of God’s people. The fulfillment of the covenant is building momentum in the latter days as God’s work progresses, blessing families throughout the world. And anyone who, like Abraham, wants to be a greater follower of righteousness—anyone who seeks the Lord earnestly—can be a part of it.\nWhat Does the Abrahamic Covenant Mean to Me?\nYou are a child of the covenant. You make a covenant with God when you are baptized and when you partake of the sacrament. And you receive the fulness of the covenant with the sacred ordinances of the temple.\nThrough these covenants and ordinances, we become God’s people.\nWe are bound to Him “with everlasting ties.” “Once we make a covenant with God,” President Russell M. Nelson has taught, “we leave neutral ground forever. God will not abandon His relationship with those who have forged such a bond with Him. In fact, all those who have made a covenant with God have access to a special kind of love and mercy. … Because of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us.”\nYou will see this in the history of God’s covenant people in the Old Testament, and you will see it in your own life as one of His covenant children.\nBe Not Afraid\n, by Dan Wilson\nThis is the precious understanding granted to us because of the Restoration of the Abrahamic covenant through the Prophet Joseph Smith.\nSo when you read about covenants in the Old Testament, don’t think just about God’s relationship with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Think also about His relationship with you. When you read about the promise of numberless posterity,\ndon’t think just about the millions who today call Abraham their father. Think also about God’s promise to you of eternal families and eternal increase.\nWhen you read about the promise of a land of inheritance, don’t think just about the land promised to Abraham. Think also about the celestial destiny of the earth itself—an inheritance promised to the “meek” who “wait upon the Lord” (\nMatthew 5:5\n;\nPsalm 37:9, 11\n).\nAnd when you read about the promise that God’s covenant people will bless “all the families of the earth” (\nAbraham 2:11\n), don’t think just about the ministry of Abraham or the prophets who descended from him.

Millions today honor him as their direct ancestor, and others have been adopted into his family through conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Yet Abraham himself came from a troubled family—his father, who had abandoned the true worship of God, tried to have Abraham sacrificed to false gods. In spite of this, Abraham’s desire was “to be a greater follower of righteousness” (\nAbraham 1:2\n), and the account of his life shows that God honored his desire. Abraham’s life stands as a testimony that no matter what a person’s family history has been, the future can be filled with hope.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAbraham 1:1–19\nGod will bless me for my faith and righteous desires.\n“We are all influenced by our families [and] our culture,” Elder Neil L. Andersen taught, “and yet I believe there is a place inside of us that we uniquely and individually control and create. … Eventually, our inner desires are given life and they are seen in our choices and in our actions” (“\nEducate Your Desires, Elder Andersen Counsels\n,”\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Consider how\nAbraham 1:1–19\ndemonstrates what Elder Andersen taught. Questions like these might help:\nWhat did Abraham desire? How were his desires evident in his actions? How did God support his desires?\nWhat are your desires? How are they evident in your actions? How does God support you?\nWhat message do these verses have for people whose family members do not desire righteousness?\nOne of Abraham and Sarah’s greatest desires—to have a child—went unfulfilled for many years (see\nGenesis 15:1–6\n). What do you learn from\nHebrews 11:8–13\nabout how Abraham and Sarah faced this trial? How does the Savior help you “embrace” His promises, even if they are “afar off”?\nSee also “Deliverance of Abraham” (video), Gospel Library.\nDeliverance of Abraham\nGenesis 12:1–3\n;\n13:15–16\n;\n15:1–6\n;\n17:1–8, 15–22\n;\nAbraham 2:6–11\nGod wants me to make and keep covenants with Him.\nWhy is it important for you to know about the covenant God made with Abraham? Because God wants to make a similar covenant with you. He promised that this covenant would continue in Abraham’s posterity, or “seed,” and that “as many as receive this Gospel shall be … accounted thy seed” (see\nAbraham 2:10–11\n). In other words, the covenant continues in you—when you are baptized and more completely when you make covenants in the temple (see\nGalatians 3:26–29\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 132:30–32\n).\nFor that reason, you might want to study\nAbraham 2:6–11\nand make a list of what, exactly, God promised Abraham and Sarah (see also\nGenesis 12:1–3\n;\n13:15–16\n;\n15:1–6\n;\n17:1–8, 15–22\n). How might these blessings apply to you?\nSome of these promises have eternal parallels. How are promises like a land of inheritance or a large posterity fulfilled eternally? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 131:1–4\n;\n132:20–24, 28–32\n).\nBesides promising blessings, God told Abraham to “\nbe\na blessing” (\nGenesis 12:2\n; emphasis added). What do you think that means? How will\nyou\nbe a blessing? (see\nAbraham 2:11\n).\nTo teach about covenants, Elder Dale G. Renlund spoke of tidal waves in the Amazon River, and President Emily Belle Freeman talked about walking a rocky path with a broken ankle (see “\nAccessing God’s Power through Covenants\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 35–37; “\nWalking in Covenant Relationship with Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 76–79). Search one or both of these messages for sentences that help answer the question “Why does God want me to make covenants with Him?”\nInvite people to teach each other.\nIf you’re teaching your family or a Church class about covenants, consider giving each person a portion of Elder Renlund’s or President Freeman’s message to study. Then they could share with the rest of the family or class what they learned. This allows people to testify to and learn from each other, and that invites the Spirit. (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n26\n.)\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nAbrahamic Covenant\n,” Gospel Library; “\nThoughts to Keep in Mind: The Covenant\n,” in this resource.\nThe Abrahamic Covenant\n, by Dilleen Marsh (detail)\nGenesis 14:18–19\n;\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:25–40\n“Melchizedek was a man of faith.”\nImagine you were introducing Melchizedek to someone who didn’t know him. What would you say? Look for ideas in\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:26–27, 33–38\n(in the Bible appendix);\nAlma 13:13–19\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 107:1–4\n.

The last time Jacob had seen Esau, about 20 years earlier, Esau wanted to kill him. Jacob spent all night in a wrestle, seeking a blessing from God. As a result of Jacob’s faith, persistence, and determination, God answered his prayers. That night Jacob’s name was changed to Israel, a name that means, among other things, “he perseveres with God” (\nGenesis 32:28\n, footnote\nb\n).\nNear the Jabbok River, Jacob received the name\nIsrael\n.\nThis is the first time the name\nIsrael\nappears in the Bible, and it’s a name that perseveres throughout the book and throughout history. The name soon came to refer to more than just one man. Israel had 12 sons, and their descendants were collectively known as the “house of Israel,” the “tribes of Israel,” the “children of Israel,” or the “Israelites.”\nThroughout history, the children of Israel attached great significance to their descent from one of the twelve tribes of Israel. Their lineage was an important part of their covenant identity. The Apostle Paul proclaimed that he was “of the tribe of Benjamin” (\nRomans 11:1\n). One reason Lehi sent his sons to Jerusalem to retrieve the plates of brass was that the plates contained “a genealogy of his fathers” (\n1 Nephi 5:14\n). Lehi discovered that he was a descendant of Joseph, and his posterity’s understanding of their connection to the house of Israel proved important to them in the years that followed.\nIn the Church today, you may hear about Israel in expressions like “the gathering of Israel.” We sing about the “Redeemer of Israel,” the “Hope of Israel,” and “Ye Elders of Israel.”\nIn these cases, we aren’t talking or singing about the ancient kingdom of Israel or the modern nation called Israel. Rather, we are referring to people who have been gathered from the nations of the world into the Church of Jesus Christ. We are referring to people who persevere with God, who earnestly seek His blessings, and who, through baptism, have become His covenant people. In the words of President Russell M. Nelson, to be of Israel means “to let God prevail in our lives, … to let God be the most powerful influence in our lives.”\nYour patriarchal blessing declares your connection to one of the tribes of the house of Israel. That’s more than an interesting piece of family history. It also has to do with your present and future. Being a part of the house of Israel means you have a covenant relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. It means that you, like Abraham, are meant to “be a blessing” to God’s children (\nGenesis 12:2\n;\nAbraham 2:9–11\n). It means, in the words of Peter, that “ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light” (\n1 Peter 2:9\n). It means that\nyou\n“let God prevail”—that you are one who “perseveres with God” as you honor your covenants with Him.\nFamily Tree of Jacob (Israel)\n, by Brent Evans\nNotes\nSee also\nGenesis 32:24–32\n. There are other meanings for the name Israel, including “God rules,” “God fights or perseveres,” and “Let God prevail.”\nSee\nAlma 26:36\n;\n3 Nephi 20:25\n.\nHymns\n(1985),\nnos. 6\n,\n259\n,\n319\n.\nRussell M.

Hopkinson (detail)\nMarch 2–8: “Let God Prevail”\nGenesis 24–33\nHow do you secure for yourself a blessing from God? You might say that the account of Jacob, grandson of Abraham and Sarah, is the story of a man who learned the answer to that question. In a culture where the firstborn son received a birthright blessing, Jacob was born second, grasping the heel of his twin brother, Esau. The name “Jacob” means “supplanter”—one who replaces someone else. Jacob lived up to that name by trying, more than once, to supplant Esau as inheritor of the birthright blessing because Esau was unworthy of it (see\nGenesis 25:30–34\n;\n26:34–35\n;\n27:36\n). The result was discord in the family, and Jacob had to flee for his life into the wilderness.\nYears later, God commanded Jacob to return home. On the way, Jacob, in humility, again sought a blessing from God. The scriptures describe this time as a “wrestle” for Jacob, and he declared that he would not give up “except thou bless me” (\nGenesis 32:26\n). Then came the lesson—and the blessing. God changed Jacob’s name to Israel—meaning, among other things, “let God prevail.” Israel learned that to receive God’s most valuable blessings, His covenant blessings, it’s not necessary to supplant someone else. His blessings aren’t purchased or seized or won. He gives them freely to all who live up to the name of Israel—who let God prevail in their lives.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 24\nCovenant marriage is essential to God’s eternal plan.\nWhile reading\nGenesis 24\n, ask yourself why Abraham considered the marriage of his son Isaac to be so important. Why is marriage important to God?\nWhat qualities do you find in Rebekah that would contribute to a strong marriage and family? (see especially\nverses 15–28, 57–61\n).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nMarriage\n,” Gospel Library.\nGenesis 25:29–34\nI can value eternal things over temporal things.\nIn Isaac and Rebekah’s culture, the oldest son received the birthright, which meant a greater inheritance, along with greater responsibilities for caring for the family. As you read\nGenesis 25:29–34\n, ponder why Esau might have been willing to give up his birthright in exchange for a meal. What lessons do you find for yourself in this account? It might help to make two lists: (1) eternal blessings God wants to give you and (2) worldly things that might distract you. Then you could read the passage, replacing “birthright” with something from the first list and “pottage” with something from the second. How will you focus on the Savior and the eternal blessings of His gospel?\nSee also\nMatthew 6:19–33\n; M. Russell Ballard, “\nRemember What Matters Most\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 105–7.\nJacob at Bethel\n, by James Smetham\nGenesis 28\nThe covenants of the Lord’s house bring God’s power into my life.\nWhile sleeping on a pillow of stones, Jacob had a life-changing dream. It was such a sacred experience that Jacob named the place Bethel, or “house of God,” declaring, “Surely the Lord is in this place” (\nGenesis 28:16\n).\nAs you read\nGenesis 28\n, you might ask yourself what made this experience so sacred to Jacob. What was he going through at the time? How might he have been feeling? You could also look for words and phrases in\nverses 10–22\nthat remind you of the house of the Lord. What impressions do you receive about God, His house, and His covenants?\nAt the end of this outline is a painting that depicts Jacob’s dream; you might refer to it as you read.

What truths from the story would you try to portray?\nThe hymn “\nNearer, My God, to Thee\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 100) is based on Jacob’s experience. What connections do you see between this song and\nGenesis 28:10–22\n? How does the temple help you feel nearer to God? Consider looking for answers to this question in President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nThe Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 93–96). You may also want to review the covenants and blessings of the house of the Lord in\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n27.2\n(Gospel Library). How does keeping these covenants bring God’s power into your life?\nBe creative.\nThere are many ways to learn from the scriptures besides just reading them. Some people find that they understand the scriptures better if they draw pictures of the accounts. Others find spiritual insights in sacred music related to the scriptures. Don’t limit yourself to one way of learning; be open to trying a variety of approaches.\nGenesis 29:31–35\n;\n30:1–24\nThe Lord remembers me in my trials.\nAs you read\nGenesis 29:31–35\nand\n30:1–24\n, look for words describing God’s mercy to Rachel and Leah. Ponder how God has “looked upon [your] affliction” and “remembered” you (\nGenesis 29:32\n;\n30:22\n).\nGenesis 32–33\nThe Savior can heal my family.\nAs Jacob returned to Canaan, he was “greatly afraid and distressed” about how his brother, Esau, would receive him (\nGenesis 32:7\n). As you read\nGenesis 32–33\n, ponder your own family relationships—perhaps especially one that needs healing. Maybe this story could inspire you to reach out to someone. Questions like these could guide your reading:\nHow did Jacob prepare to meet Esau?\nWhat stands out to you about Jacob’s prayer found in\nGenesis 32:9–12\n?\nWhat do you learn about forgiveness from Esau’s example?\nHow can the Savior help us heal family relationships?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nWhy did Abraham not want Isaac to marry a Canaanite?\nWhy did Jacob pretend to be Esau?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 24:10–21\nI can be kind to others.\nTo highlight Rebekah’s impressive example of kindness, you could show your children the picture below or this week’s activity page as you summarize the story in\nGenesis 24:10–21\n. Your children might enjoy acting out the story. This could lead to a conversation about acts of kindness you and your children have seen.\nConsider singing a song about kindness together, such as “\nKindness Begins with Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 145). Your children could listen for the word “kindness” (or a similar word) and stand when they hear it. How can we be kind like Rebekah?\nOld Testament Heroes\n, by Dilleen Marsh (detail)\nGenesis 25:21–34\nEternal things are more important than worldly things.\nConsider using “\nJacob and Esau\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 38–41) to help your children understand the story in\nGenesis 25:21–34\n. Maybe your children could imagine that Esau asked for their advice about whether he should trade his birthright for the pottage. What would they say to him?\nJacob and Esau\nWhat things matter eternally to you and your children? Perhaps your children could find pictures or objects that represent these things. How can we show the Lord that these things are important to us?\nGenesis 28:10–22\nCovenants help me return to Heavenly Father.\nAs you read\nGenesis 28:10–22\ntogether, you could use a ladder or a staircase (or a picture like the one at the end of this outline) to talk about how our covenants are like a ladder. Maybe your children could pretend to climb a ladder, and with each step, talk about times when we promise to obey God, such as when we are baptized, take the sacrament, or go to the temple. How do our covenants bring us closer to God?\nGenesis 32:6–11\n;\n33:1–4\nHeavenly Father and Jesus Christ can help me love my family.\nTo introduce these verses, you might explain that after many years of hard feelings, Jacob was going to meet Esau again. Read together\nGenesis 32:6–11\n. How did Jacob feel? What did he do to get help? Read together\nGenesis 33:1–4\nto discover how the Lord answered Jacob’s prayer. If Jacob and Esau could talk to us today, what might they say to help us when there is contention in our family?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nJacob’s Dream\n, by J. Ken Spencer\nOpen PDF"

      "plain_text": "“March 9–15. ‘The Lord Was with Joseph’: Genesis 37–41,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“March 9–15. ‘The Lord Was with Joseph’,”\nCome, Follow Me: 2026\nJoseph and His Brothers\n, by Sam Lawlor\nMarch 9–15: “The Lord Was with Joseph”\nGenesis 37–41\nWe know that God blesses people who trust Him and keep His commandments. But sometimes it doesn’t seem that way. Sometimes the person who trusts God is abused and abandoned by family members. Sometimes the person who bravely refuses to violate the law of chastity gets falsely accused anyway. When things like that happen to us, we might be tempted to become angry with God. We might wonder, “What’s the point of trying to do the right thing if it only seems to make life harder?”\nJoseph, the son of Jacob, could have wondered that. At times, this faithful man prospered; at other times, it seemed that the more faithful he was, the more hardship he faced. But Joseph never left the Lord, and the Lord never left Joseph. That doesn’t mean the Lord prevented bad things from happening to Joseph, but through it all, “the Lord was with him” (\nGenesis 39:3\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 37:1–28\n;\n39\n;\n41:9–45\nThe Lord will be with me in my adversity.\nTime and again, good fortune seemed to abandon Joseph, but the Lord never did. As you read Joseph’s story, ponder questions such as these: What did Joseph do to stay close to the Lord? How was the Lord “with him”? (see\nGenesis 39\n;\n40:1–19\n;\n41:9–45\n). What do you learn from Joseph’s story that could help you recognize the Lord’s presence in your life?\nYou might also ask similar questions about your life. What evidence have you seen that the Lord has not forsaken you in times of trial? Consider how you can share your experiences with family members and future generations (see\n1 Nephi 5:14\n).\nOf course, you will have other trials in the future. What can you do now to help ensure that these trials don’t pull you away from the Lord? Consider writing a letter to encourage your future self to stay close to Him no matter what. You might include insights from Joseph’s life or from President D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nOur Relationship with God\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 78–81).\nSee also\nJohn 14:18\n;\nRomans 8:28\n;\nAlma 36:3\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:7–8\n; “\nAbide with Me!\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 166.\nGenesis 37:5–11\n;\n40\n;\n41:1–38\nIf I am faithful, the Lord will guide and inspire me.\nJoseph had a gift for discerning messages from the Lord through dreams. What can you learn from\nGenesis 37:5–11\n;\n40:5–8\n;\n41:14–25, 37–38\nabout receiving and understanding revelation from the Lord? For instance, what can you learn from Joseph’s example when revelation seems difficult to understand? (see\nGenesis 40:8\n;\n41:16\n).\nPonder how the Lord is revealing His will to you. What are you doing to act on revelation He has given you? How are you seeking additional guidance from Him?’\nJoseph Interpreting the Butler and Baker’s Dreams\n, by François Gérard\nGenesis 39:1–20\nWith the Lord’s help, I can flee temptation.\nIf Joseph were to give counsel on how to resist temptation to commit sexual sin, what do you think he would say? Think about this as you read about his experience in\nGenesis 39\n. For example, consider how Joseph might respond to concerns like these:\nIf no one else knows what I’m doing, what’s the big deal? (see\nverses 8–9\n).\nI try to resist, but the temptation just doesn’t seem to stop (see\nverse 10\n).\nWhat should I do when I’m in a situation where temptation is strong? (see\nverse 12\n).\nHow would you explain why obeying the law of chastity is important? (see\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n,\n23–28\n).\nJoseph’s example, of course, can apply to other kinds of temptation. With Joseph’s experience in mind, consider making a plan for avoiding and resisting temptation. For example, you could think of a temptation and write down situations to avoid and how you will “flee” when the temptation arises.\nTemptation\nSituations to avoid\nPlan to respond\nHere are some other scriptures that could inform your plan. What do you learn from each about how the Savior can help you resist temptation?\nMatthew 4:1–11\n;\n1 Corinthians 10:13\n;\n1 Nephi 15:23–24\n;\n3 Nephi 18:17–18\n.\nAs you make your plan, it might also help to think about times in the past when you successfully avoided or resisted temptation. How did the Savior help you? (see\n2 Nephi 4:18–33\n).\nGenesis 41:15–57\nThe Lord will help me prepare for possible hardships.\nJoseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dream led to some very wise and practical counsel for surviving a famine (see\nGenesis 41:15–57\n). Consider what spiritual messages the Lord might have for you in this account. How do you feel He wants you to prepare for hardships in your future?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nWe Will Prove Them Herewith\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 8–11.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nHow was Joseph similar to Jesus Christ?\nWhat does the Book of Mormon teach about Joseph’s coat?\nWhat do we understand about what took place between Judah and Tamar?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 37\nI can be kind to my family.\nReading about the hard feelings in Joseph’s family could prompt a discussion about how we should treat family members. To tell the story of Joseph and his brothers from\nGenesis 37\n, you could use the pictures in this outline or in “\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 47–51). Let your children share details they know about the story. You might ask your children to imagine they were in Joseph’s family. What would they have said or done to be a peacemaker in the family? For example, what does it mean to “speak peaceably” in our family? (\nverse 4\n). How is Jesus Christ a peacemaker in God’s family?\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\nGenesis 37:18–28\n;\n39:20–23\n;\n41:38\nGod can help me when bad things happen.\nWhen your children face hard times, they need to know that the Lord will be with them, as He was with Joseph. Perhaps you could help your children make a list of hard things that happened to Joseph (see\nGenesis 37:23–28\n;\n39:20\n; or “\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\n” and “\nJoseph in Egypt\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 47–51, 52–56). After each hardship they find, invite your children to repeat, “The Lord was with Joseph” (\nGenesis 39:2\n).\nJoseph’s Inspired Dreams\nJoseph in Egypt\nPerhaps your children could search\nGenesis 39:1–3, 20–23\nfor every instance of the phrase “The Lord was with Joseph” and similar phrases. Let them share what they think this phrase means. How do we know that the Lord is with us? Tell each other about how you felt God was with you during a challenging time.\nJoseph of Egypt in Prison\n, by Jeff Ward (detail)\nGenesis 39:7–12\nWith the Lord’s help, I can flee temptation.\nHere’s an object lesson that can help your children follow Joseph’s example of fleeing from Potiphar’s wife: Use two magnets to represent Jesus Christ and Satan. Use a small metal object, like a paper clip, to represent us. Then let your children see how the influence of a magnet on the metal object is stronger when they move the object closer to it. How does Joseph’s experience in\nGenesis 39:7–12\nillustrate this truth? What can we do to move away from sin and closer to Jesus? The video “Temptation Fades as We Seek Christ in Every Thought” (Gospel Library) and a song like “\nI Need Thee Every Hour\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 98) can help with this discussion.\nTemptation Fades as We Seek Christ in Every Thought\nUse music.\n“Hymns and other sacred songs can help children feel God’s love, feel the Spirit, and learn gospel truths. The melodies, rhythms, and simple rhymes can help children remember gospel truths for years to come. As you sing with children, help them discover and understand the principles taught in the songs” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n).\nHelp your children think of temptations they might face. Let them role-play how they could “flee” from these temptations.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nJoseph, the Dream Interpreter\n, by Kristi Kirisberg Harmon\nOpen PDF"

      "plain_text": "“March 16–22. ‘God Meant It unto Good’: Genesis 42–50,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“March 16–22. ‘God Meant It unto Good’,”\nCome, Follow Me: 2026\nForgiveness\n, by Megan Rieker\nMarch 16–22: “God Meant It unto Good”\nGenesis 42–50\nIt had been about 22 years since Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery. Joseph had suffered many trials, including false accusations and imprisonment. When he finally saw his brothers again, Joseph was the governor of all Egypt, second only to the pharaoh. He could easily have taken revenge on his brothers, and considering what they had done to Joseph, that might seem understandable. And yet Joseph forgave them. Not only that, but he helped them see divine purpose in his suffering. “God meant it unto good” (\nGenesis 50:20\n), he told them, because it put him in a position to save “all his father’s household” (\nGenesis 47:12\n) from famine.\nIn many ways, Joseph was like Jesus Christ. Even though our sins caused Jesus great suffering, He offers forgiveness, delivering all of us from a fate far worse than famine. Whether we need to receive forgiveness or extend it—at some point we all need to do both—Joseph’s example points us to the Savior, the true source of healing and reconciliation.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nGenesis 45:5–7\n;\n47:12\n“God sent me before you to preserve you.”\nHave you noticed any similarities between Joseph’s life and the atoning mission of Jesus Christ? To see some examples of these similarities, try comparing:\nGenesis 37:3\nwith\nMatthew 3:17\n.\nGenesis 37:26–28\nwith\nMatthew 26:14–16\n.\nGenesis 45:5–7\nwith\nLuke 4:18\n.\nGenesis 47:12\nwith\nJohn 6:35\n.\nWhat impressions do you have about the Savior and His mission as you read these passages?\nGenesis 45\n;\n50:15–21\nForgiveness brings healing.\nReading about Joseph forgiving his brothers of the terrible things they had done may prompt you to think about someone you are currently struggling to forgive. The following questions may help as you strive to apply this principle:\nWhy might it have been hard for Joseph to forgive his brothers? (to review what they did to him, see\nGenesis 37\n). What experiences or attitudes might have given Joseph the strength to forgive? (see, for example,\nGenesis 45:1–15\nor\n50:15–21\n).\nWhat blessings came from Joseph’s forgiveness of his brothers? For example, compare the relationships in Jacob’s family at the beginning of the story (see, for example,\nGenesis 37:3–11\n) with the relationships at the end (see\nGenesis 45:9–15\n;\n50:15–21\n). How might things have turned out differently if Joseph had not been willing to forgive?\nConsider writing down the name of someone who may need your forgiveness—whether or not they have asked for forgiveness. What can you do to invite the Savior’s healing power into that situation? If forgiving seems too difficult, consider reviewing the counsel of Elder Gerrit W. Gong in the last six paragraphs of his message “\nHappy and Forever\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 85). What do you find that gives you hope that you can forgive?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:9–11\n; “Forgiveness: My Burden Was Made Light” (video), Gospel Library.\nForgiveness: My Burden Was Made Light\nGenesis 49\nJacob gave his family prophetic blessings.\nJacob’s blessings to his posterity contain vivid imagery, but they aren’t easy to understand. Thankfully, the restored gospel gives us some help. When you read the blessing to Joseph in\nGenesis 49:22–26\n, read the following verses too, and see what insights they provide:\n1 Nephi 15:12\n;\n2 Nephi 3:4–5\n;\nJacob 2:25\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:44\n.\nAs you read about Judah’s blessing in\nGenesis 49:8–12\n, remember that Jesus Christ was a descendant of Judah. What do you find in these verses that reminds you of the Savior? (see also\nRevelation 5:5–6, 9\n;\n1 Nephi 15:14–15\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:59\n;\n133:46–50\n).\nReading these blessings might inspire you to review your patriarchal blessing—or, if you don’t have one, to receive one. What words and phrases in your blessing turn your thoughts to Jesus Christ?\nSee also Randall K. Bennett, “\nYour Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 42–44.\nGenesis 50:19–21\nGod can help me find meaning in my trials.\nThough it may not have been clear while he was going through it, Joseph was eventually able to look back on his adversity in Egypt and see that “God meant it unto good” (\nGenesis 50:20\n). If you could have visited Joseph while he was in the pit or in prison, how would you have comforted him? How can\nGenesis 50:19–21\nhelp you in your times of trial?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 122\n; “\nHow Firm a Foundation\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 85.\nJoseph Smith among the Prophets\n, by Paul Mann (detail)\nGenesis 50:24–25\n“A seer shall the Lord my God raise up.”\nAs you read\nGenesis 50:24–25\nand\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24–38\n(in the Bible appendix), ponder why it would have been important for Joseph to know about Moses and Joseph Smith so many centuries in advance. How did Joseph Smith fulfill Joseph’s prophecies about him? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:17–23\n;\n20:7–12\n;\n39:11\n;\n135:3\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nWhy did Joseph test his brothers?\nWhy did Jacob adopt Joseph’s two sons?\nWhy did Jacob place his right hand on Ephraim instead of Manasseh?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nGenesis 42–44\n;\n45:4–15\nI can show love and forgiveness to my family.\nIt might be fun for your children to reenact the story of Joseph reuniting his family (see\nGenesis 42–44\n). Or they could use “\nJoseph and the Famine\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 57–60) or pictures in this outline to teach the story to each other. Here are some questions that could help your children learn from the story:\nWhat did Joseph do to show love for his family? (see\nGenesis 45:4–15\n).\nWhy do you feel Joseph forgave his brothers?\nHow do you think Joseph’s brothers felt when they found out Joseph had forgiven them? Who in your life needs to be forgiven? How can you show love and forgiveness?\nJoseph and the Famine\nAs you prepare to teach, ask, “What will my children do to learn?”\nFor example, in this activity your children are acting out or retelling a story. Doing this will help them remember both what happened and the gospel principles contained in the story.\nYou or your children may want to share an experience when they forgave someone or when someone forgave them. You could then sing a song such as “\nLove One Another\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 136) or “\nHelp Me, Dear Father\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 99).\nGenesis 48:8–9\nThe Lord helps me through priesthood blessings.\nYou and your children could look at the picture of Jacob blessing his sons at the end of this outline and discuss what is happening (see\nGenesis 48:8–9\n). If needed, explain that Jacob, Joseph’s father, wanted to give priesthood blessings to his family. Perhaps you could share with each other any experiences you’ve had receiving help from God through a priesthood blessing. What are some reasons we might ask for a priesthood blessing?\nGenesis 45:5–11\nHeavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to save me.\nHow can you help your children see the Savior in the story of Joseph saving his family from famine?

Help your children search the following pairs of scriptures and fill in the chart with things that Joseph and Jesus have in common:\nGenesis 37:3\nand\nMatthew 3:17\n;\nGenesis 37:26–28\nand\nMatthew 26:14–16\n;\nGenesis 45:5–7\nand\nLuke 4:18\n; and\nGenesis 47:12\nand\nJohn 6:35\n.\nAsk your children what it means to save or rescue someone. If any of them have had an experience being saved or rescued from danger, invite them to share. How did Joseph save his brothers? (see\nGenesis 42:1–3\n;\n45:5–7\n).

But after hundreds of years, their descendants were enslaved and terrorized by a new pharaoh who “knew not Joseph” (\nExodus 1:8\n). It would have been natural for the Israelites to wonder why God allowed this to happen to them, His covenant people. Did He remember the covenant He had made with them? Were they still His people? Could He see how much they were suffering?\nThere may be times when you’ve felt like asking similar questions. You might wonder, “Does God know what I’m going through? Can He hear my pleas for help?” Israel’s deliverance from Egypt answers such questions clearly: God does not forget His people. He remembers His covenants with us and will fulfill them in His own time and way. “I will redeem you with a stretched out arm,” He declares. “I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under [your] burdens” (\nExodus 6:6–7\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Exodus, see “\nExodus, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and Church\nExodus 1–2\nGod can work through me to fulfill His purposes.\nWhat impresses you about the women described in\nExodus 1–2\n? How did they help fulfill God’s plan for His people? What do their efforts teach you about service in God’s work?\nExodus 1–3\nJesus Christ is my Deliverer.\nBefore you begin reading Exodus, you might think about a hardship you’re going through—something you hope the Lord will deliver you from. What words and phrases in\nExodus 1–3\nsound similar to spiritual captivity or other things we face today? Notice also how the children of Israel sought deliverance and how the Lord responded (see, for example,\nExodus 2:23–25\n;\n3:7–8\n). How has the Lord “come down to deliver” you?\nThroughout the book of Exodus, you might also note some similarities between Moses and Jesus Christ (see\nDeuteronomy 18:18–19\n;\n1 Nephi 22:20–21\n). For example, what similarities do you see between\nExodus 1:22\n;\n2:1–10\nand\nMatthew 2:13–16\n? Or between\nExodus 24:18\nand\nMatthew 4:1–2\n? What do you feel the Lord wants you to understand about Himself and His power?\nLook for symbols that testify of Jesus Christ.\n“You can … find parallels to the Savior’s life in the lives of prophets and other faithful men and women in the scriptures. [Doing so] reveals truths about the Savior in places you might otherwise overlook” (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n; see also\nHosea 12:10\n).\nFaith at Water’s Edge\n, by Anne Marie Oborn\nExodus 3:1–6\nI can show reverence for holy things and places.\nCan you think of a time when something filled you with awe and wonder? How did you react? How would you describe the emotions you felt?\nWith that in mind, read\nExodus 3:1–6\n. What impresses you about Moses’s inspiring experience? What did Moses do to show reverence for God? What connections do you see between his actions and reverence for sacred things?\nReading these verses might prompt you to think about holy things and holy places in your life. Why are they sacred to you? How do you treat them differently from things that are common? To guide your pondering, you could refer to the section titled “\nRemembering the Promises\n” in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “Exceeding Great and Precious Promises” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 91–93). You might also sing or listen to a hymn that inspires awe, like “\nI Stand All Amazed\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 193) and ponder what it is about the gospel that amazes you.\nOf course, even when we’ve had wonderful spiritual experiences, there’s a danger of becoming too casual about sacred things. How do you avoid this? Here are two messages that address this issue; pick one, and look for statements that help you: Ulisses Soares, “\nIn Awe of Christ and His Gospel\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 115–17); Gérald Caussé, “\nIs It Still Wonderful to You?\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 98–100).\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:10–12\n;\n63:64\n.\nExodus 3–4\nGod gives power to people He calls to do His work.\nToday we know Moses as a great prophet and leader. But Moses did not see himself that way when the Lord first called him. As you read\nExodus 3–4\n, list Moses’s concerns and how the Lord responded to each. What do you find in these chapters that might inspire you when you feel inadequate? When have you seen God empower you or others to do His work?\nSee also “\nThe Church Gives Us Opportunities to Assist in God’s Work\n” in “Church Organization” in Topics and Questions, Gospel Library.\nExodus 5–6\nThe Lord’s purposes will be fulfilled in His own time.\nIt can be discouraging when our sincere efforts to do good don’t seem to be working—when we’re trying to do the Lord’s will but we’re not seeing the results we expected. To learn about a similar experience Moses had, read\nExodus 5:4–9, 20–23\n. How did the Lord help Moses overcome his feelings of discouragement? (see\nExodus 6:1–13\n). How has the Lord helped you persist in doing His will?\nSee also Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nWaiting on the Lord\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 115–17.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nWhy did Moses slay an Egyptian?\nWho was Jethro?\nWhat can we learn about the glory of God from the burning bush?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nExodus 1–2\nGod can work through me to fulfill His purposes.\nMoses had a major role in freeing Israel from bondage.

Talk with each other about other people you admire who help with God’s work, including in small and simple ways. How can we follow their example?\nBaby Moses\nExodus 3:1–5\nI can treat holy places with reverence.\nAfter reading\nExodus 3:1–5\ntogether, ask your children to summarize these verses in their own words (see also “\nMoses the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 64–66). You could also review the beginning of Elder Ulisses Soares’s message “\nReverence for Sacred Things\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2025, 108). How did Moses show reverence in the Lord’s presence? How does the Lord want us to show reverence? You might also ask your children to help you find (or draw) pictures of sacred places or activities where we should be reverent.

What does that mean? In part, it means that the Savior’s life influences the eternal destiny of everyone who has ever lived or ever will live. You might also say that the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, on that first Easter Sunday, connects all of God’s people throughout history: those who were born before His Resurrection looked forward to it with faith (see\nJacob 4:4\n), and those born after look back on it with faith. As we read Old Testament accounts and prophecies, we don’t ever see the name Jesus Christ, but we do see the evidence of the ancient believers’ faith in and longing for their Messiah and Redeemer. So we who are invited to\nremember\nHim can feel a connection with those who\nlooked forward\nto Him.

Barrett\nApril 6–12: “Remember This Day, in Which Ye Came Out from Egypt”\nExodus 7–13\nPlague after plague afflicted Egypt, but Pharaoh still refused to release the Israelites. And yet God continued to demonstrate His power and give Pharaoh opportunities to accept “that I am the Lord” and “there is none like me in all the earth” (\nExodus 7:5\n;\n9:14\n). Meanwhile, Moses and the Israelites must have watched with awe at these manifestations of God’s power on their behalf. Surely these continued signs confirmed their faith in God and strengthened their willingness to follow God’s prophet. Then, after nine terrible plagues had failed to free the Israelites, it was the tenth plague—the death of the firstborn, including Pharaoh’s firstborn—that finally ended the captivity. This seems fitting because in every case of spiritual captivity, there truly is only one way to escape. It is only the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Firstborn—the blood of the Lamb without blemish—that will save us.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 7–11\nI can choose to soften my heart.\nHopefully, your will is never opposed to God’s will as Pharaoh’s was. Still, we all have times when our hearts aren’t as soft as they should be. What stands out to you about Pharaoh’s responses to the plagues in\nExodus 7:14–25\n;\n8:5–32\n;\n9:1–26\n;\n10:12–29\n;\n12:29–33\n? Note the clarification in the Joseph Smith Translation of\nExodus 7:3, 13\n;\n9:12\n.\nWhy is “hard” a good description of Pharaoh’s heart? Consider what you learn from these verses about having a soft heart:\n1 Nephi 2:16\n;\nMosiah 3:19\n;\nAlma 24:7–8\n;\n62:41\n;\nEther 12:27\n. As you read about the consequences of Pharaoh’s hard-heartedness, ponder the condition of your heart. What changes do you feel inspired to make?\nExodus 12:1–42\nJesus Christ can save me because of His Atonement.\nThe only way for the Israelites to be spared from the tenth plague, described in\nExodus 11:4–5\n, was to follow precisely the instructions the Lord gave to Moses in\nExodus 12\n, a ritual known as the Passover. The Passover teaches us through symbols that just as the Lord delivered the Israelites from bondage in Egypt, He can also deliver us from the bondage of sin. To explore this symbolism in\nExodus 12:1–42\n, you could use a chart like this one:\nSymbol\nPossible meanings\nGod’s message to me\nSymbol\nThe beginning of months\n(\nverse 2\n; the Lord commanded the Israelites to use this event to mark the beginning of their calendar).\nPossible meanings\nThis was to be a new beginning for Israel. They were to be “born again.”\nSymbol\nThe lamb\n(\nverses 3–5\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\nJohn 1:29\n;\n6:54\n;\n1 Peter 1:19\n.\nSymbol\nBlood of the lamb on the doorposts\n(\nverses 7, 13, 23\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\nMosiah 4:2\n;\nRevelation 12:11\n.\nSymbol\nUnleavened bread\n(\nverses 8, 15, 19–20\n).\nPossible meanings\nLeaven, or yeast, can be a symbol of corruption because it spoils easily. See\nMatthew 16:6–12\n;\nJohn 6:35\n.\nSymbol\nBitter herbs\n(\nverse 8\n).\nPossible meanings\nA reminder of the bitterness of sin and captivity. See\nExodus 1:14\n;\nMoses 6:55\n.\nSymbol\nEating in haste, dressed to leave\n(\nverse 11\n).\nPossible meanings\nA symbol of urgency to leave the captivity of sin. See\nGenesis 39:12\n;\n2 Timothy 2:22\n.\nSymbol\nThe destroyer\n(\nverses 13, 23\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\nDoctrine and Covenants 89:18–21\n.\nSymbol\nThe Israelites were set free\n(\nverses 29–32\n).\nPossible meanings\nSee\n2 Nephi 2:26\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:15–19, 31\n.\nWhat else do you find in the instructions and symbols of the Passover that reminds you of Jesus Christ and His Atonement? What do these symbols suggest to you about how to receive the blessings of His Atonement?\nCome unto Christ by identifying symbols that testify of Him.\n“All things,” the Lord declared, “are created and made to bear record of me” (\nMoses 6:63\n; see also\n2 Nephi 11:4\n). In\nExodus 12\n, symbols like a lamb, blood, unleavened bread, miracles, and deliverance all point to Christ. “Once we understand how these objects relate to the Savior, they can teach us of His power and attributes” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n7\n).\nIn Remembrance of Me\n, by Walter Rane\nExodus 12:14–17, 24–27\n;\n13:1–16\nThe sacrament helps me remember my deliverance through Jesus Christ.\nThe Savior commanded the Israelites to observe the Passover each year to help them remember He had delivered them, even after their captivity became a distant memory. As you read His instructions in\nExodus 12:14–17, 24–27\n;\n13:1–16\n, think about what you are doing to remember God’s blessings for you. How can you preserve that remembrance “throughout your generations”? (see\nExodus 12:14, 26–27\n).\nWhat similarities do you see between the feast of the Passover and the sacrament? What can you do to “always remember” Jesus Christ? (\nMoroni 4:3\n;\n5:2\n).\nYou might also ponder other things the Lord wants you to remember; see, for example,\nHelaman 5:6–12\n;\nMoroni 10:3\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 3:3–5, 10\n;\n18:10\n;\n52:40\n.\nSee also Kevin W. Pearson, “\nAre You Still Willing?\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 67–69; “Always Remember Him” (video), Gospel Library; “\nIn Memory of the Crucified\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 190.\nAlways Remember Him\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nHow were Pharaoh’s magicians able to imitate some of the miracles performed by Moses and Aaron?\nHow did later generations continue to remember the Passover?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nExodus 7–11\nThe Lord has power over all things.\nThe plagues described in\nExodus 7–11\nshowed the Egyptians and the Israelites that the Lord has great power. The Lord will help your children throughout their lives when they have faith in His power. To help them learn from this story, you could give each child a paper divided into 10 sections, and invite them to draw pictures of the plagues described in these verses:\nExodus 7:17–18\n;\n8:1–4\n;\n8:16–17\n;\n8:20–22\n;\n9:1–6\n;\n9:8–9\n;\n9:22–23\n;\n10:4–5\n;\n10:21–22\n;\n11:4–7\n(see also “\nThe Plagues of Egypt\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 67–69). Read together\nExodus 7:5\nand\n9:14\nto explain why the Lord sent the plagues.\nThe Plagues of Egypt\nShare with your children how the Lord has shown you “that there is none like [Him] in all the earth” (\nExodus 9:14\n). Let them share how they know that the Lord is powerful.\nExodus 8:28–32\n;\n9:7\nThe Lord can help me have a soft heart.\nTo help your children visualize what it means to have a soft heart, it might be fun to show them an object that is hard, such as a rock, and another that is soft and absorbent, such as a sponge. You could also pour water over these objects to demonstrate how easily a soft heart receives the word of the Lord. You could then read together a few verses describing how Pharaoh responded to the plagues sent by the Lord (see\nExodus 8:28–32\n;\n9:7\n). Which of the objects best represents Pharaoh’s heart or attitude? What does it mean to have a soft heart? (see\nMosiah 3:19\n). Elder Christopher H. Kim’s message “\nHarden Not Your Heart\n” could also help your children understand the difference between a hard heart and a soft one (\nLiahona\n, May 2025, 118–20, especially the fifth paragraph).\nYou and your children could make a list of some actions that might show when we have a hard heart (for example, using unkind words or being unwilling to share). How can we show the Lord we want to have soft hearts?\nExodus 12:1–13\nThe sacrament can help me remember Jesus.\nThe Passover taught the Israelites to look forward to the Savior and His sacrifice for us. As you explore\nExodus 12:1–13\ntogether, help your children see connections between the details of the Passover and Jesus Christ’s Atonement (see also “\nThe Passover\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 70–74). For example, how is Jesus like the lamb described in\nverse 5\n?\nThe Passover\nToday, we take the sacrament to remember Jesus’s sacrifice. You could show your children a picture of the sacrament and talk about how this ordinance helps us remember Jesus Christ. You might help your children find the word “remember” in the sacrament prayers (see\nMoroni 4–5\n). Or sing together a favorite hymn about the sacrament, and help your children notice the peaceful feeling they have when they think about the Savior. How can we seek that feeling when we take the sacrament?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe Passover Supper\n, by Brian Call\nOpen PDF"

The Red Sea was on one side, and the army of Pharaoh was advancing on the other. Their escape from Egypt, it seemed, would be short lived. But God had a message for the Israelites that He wanted them to remember for generations: “Fear ye not. … The Lord shall fight for you” (\nExodus 14:13–14\n).\nSince that time, when God’s people have needed faith and courage, they have told this story. When Nephi wanted to inspire his brothers, he said, “Let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground” (\n1 Nephi 4:2\n). When King Limhi wanted his captive people to “lift up [their] heads, and rejoice,” he reminded them of this same story (\nMosiah 7:19\n). So did Alma, when he wanted to testify to his son of God’s power (see\nAlma 36:28\n). And when we feel trapped—when we need a little more faith to “see the salvation of the Lord”—we can remember how “the Lord saved Israel that day” (\nExodus 14:13, 30\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 14\n;\nExodus 15:1–21\nThe Lord can do a “great work” in my life.\nAs you read\nExodus 14:1–10\n, imagine how the Israelites might have felt as they saw Pharaoh’s army closing in. Perhaps you feel that you need a miracle to survive a difficult challenge you are facing. What do you find in\nExodus 14:13–31\nthat inspires you to seek God’s power in your life? Ponder how you have seen His power in the past. What have you learned about Him from these experiences?\nExodus 15:1–19\nis a song of praise that the Israelites sang after the Lord parted the Red Sea. Which phrases in this song do you find especially meaningful? Maybe there’s a hymn that you feel like singing when the Lord has done something amazing for you, such as “\nRedeemer of Israel\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 6). Consider singing or listening to it as part of your worship today.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\n.\nExodus 15:22–27\n;\n16:1–15\n;\n17:1–7\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nReading about Israel’s journey might lead you to think about things in your life that have seemed “bitter” like the waters of Marah (see\nExodus 15:23–27\n). How has the Lord made bitter things in your life sweet? What value have these experiences had in your life?\nYou’ll notice more examples of bitter experiences for the Israelites in\nExodus 16\nand\n17\n. It’s tempting to be critical of their murmuring or complaining, but as you read, consider whether you have ever done the same thing. What do you learn from the Israelites’ experiences that can help you murmur less and trust God more? What do these verses teach you about God?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 2:11–12\n.\nThe Israelites gathering manna. Neo-gothic fresco, Trnava (detail)\nExodus 16\nThe Lord offers me daily spiritual nourishment.\nSince we all need to eat, the Lord often compares spiritual things to food. Look for His spiritual lessons in the Israelites’ experiences with manna in\nExodus 16\n. For example, what do you find in the Lord’s instructions in\nExodus 16:16, 19, 22–26\nthat applies to your spiritual nourishment?\nTo discover other lessons the Lord may want you to learn from this miracle, ponder questions like these:\nWhat does the Lord give me that is like the daily manna that He gave the Israelites?\nWhat can I do that is like gathering manna?\nYou may find additional insights in one or more of these videos: “Daily Bread: Pattern,” “Daily Bread: Experience,” and “Daily Bread: Change” (Gospel Library).\nDaily Bread: Pattern\nDaily Bread: Experience\nDaily Bread: Change\nThink of other things, besides eating, that you do every day. Why do certain things have to be done daily to be effective? What do you feel inspired to do to seek daily spiritual experiences?\nSee also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nDaily Restoration\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 77–79; “Daily Restoration” (video), Gospel Library.\nDaily Restoration\nExodus 17:1–7\nJesus Christ is my spiritual rock and living water.\nThink about the Savior as you read\nExodus 17:1–7\n. How is Jesus Christ like a rock to you? (see\nPsalm 62:6–7\n;\nHelaman 5:12\n). How is He like water? (see\nJohn 4:10–14\n;\n1 Corinthians 10:1–4\n;\n1 Nephi 11:25\n).\nLook for physical objects that testify of Christ.\nWhenever the scriptures describe things that could be symbols of Jesus Christ, like\nExodus 17:1–7\ndoes, it might be an opportunity for an object lesson. Looking at or touching a rock or water can make it easier to understand how these objects are like Jesus Christ. If you can involve multiple senses in learning, it will be more memorable and impactful.\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\nDisciples help each other “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.\nThere may be times in your life when you can relate to Moses—when others are depending on you, but your “hands [feel] heavy” (\nExodus 17:12\n). Other times, you might be more like Aaron, Hur, and Jethro, who supported Moses. Put yourself in the position of each of these people as you read\nExodus 17:8–16\n;\n18:13–26\n, and see what the Lord teaches you about His work.\nSee also\nMosiah 4:27\n;\n18:8–9\n.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nWhat was the purpose of the pillar of cloud and fire?\nWhat was symbolic about Israel’s crossing of the Red Sea?\nWhy did the Lord command Moses to destroy the Amalekites?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nExodus 14:5–22\nThe Lord can do a “great work” in my life.\nWhen the Lord parted the Red Sea, Moses and the Israelites saw how powerful He is. Let your children help you think of a fun way to reenact the story from\nExodus 14:5–22\n(see also “\nThe Passover\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 70–74). Maybe you could set up chairs or blankets and “divide” them like the Red Sea. Then you could share with each other how you have seen God’s power in your lives.\nThe Passover\nWhat does\nDoctrine and Covenants 8:2–3\nadd to our understanding of the story in\nExodus 14\n? Consider telling your children about an experience when the Holy Ghost told you something in your mind or heart, and invite them to talk about their experiences. You could also sing a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “\nLet the Holy Spirit Guide\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 143).\nExodus 15:22–25\nThe Lord can make bitter things sweet.\nMaybe you and your children could drink something sweet and something bitter while studying\nExodus 15:22–25\ntogether. How has the Savior made “bitter” experiences in our lives “sweet”?\nExodus 15:23–25\n;\n16:14–15\n;\n17:1–6\nJesus is my Living Water, my Bread of Life, and my Rock.\nAs you and your children read\nExodus 15:23–25\n;\n16:14–15\n;\n17:1–6\n, let them help you find objects to help tell each story—like a branch (to heal the water at Marah), a jar or pot (to fill with manna), and a rock (for the water at Horeb).

It wasn’t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a sign between me and my Heavenly Father [see Exodus 31:13 ; Ezekiel 20:12, 20 ]. With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don’ts.

The Joseph Smith Translation of Exodus 34:1–2 (in the Bible appendix) clarifies that the first set of stone tables included the ordinances of God’s “holy order,” or the Melchizedek Priesthood. The second set included “the law of a carnal commandment.” This was a lesser law administered by the “lesser priesthood” (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:17–27 ), which was meant to prepare the Israelites for the higher law and higher priesthood so they could enter into God’s presence."

God then called Moses onto the mountain, telling him to build a tabernacle so “that I may dwell among them” (\nExodus 25:8\n).\nBut while Moses was at the top of the mountain learning how the Israelites could have God’s presence among them, the Israelites were at the bottom of the mountain making a golden idol to worship instead. Soon after promising to “have no other gods,” they “turned aside quickly” from their promise (\nExodus 20:3\n;\n32:8\n; see also\nExodus 24:3\n). It was a surprising turn, but we know from experience that faith and commitment can sometimes be overcome by impatience, fear, or doubt. As we seek the Lord’s presence in our lives, it is encouraging to know the Lord did not give up on ancient Israel and He will not give up on us and the people we love—for He is “merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth” (\nExodus 34:6\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 19:3–6\nThe Lord’s covenant people are a treasure to Him.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught: “In the Old Testament, the Hebrew term from which\npeculiar\nwas translated is\nsegullah\n, which means ‘valued property,’ or ‘treasure.’ … For us to be identified by servants of the Lord as his\npeculiar\npeople is a compliment of the highest order” (“\nChildren of the Covenant\n,”\nEnsign\n, May 1995, 34). How do President Nelson’s words affect the way you understand\nExodus 19:3–6\n? How has the Lord shown you that He treasures you?\nExodus 19:10–11, 17\nSacred experiences require preparation.\nThe Lord told Moses that the children of Israel needed to be prepared before they could “meet with God” (\nExodus 19:10–11, 17\n) and keep a covenant with Him (see\nExodus 19:5\n). How do you prepare for spiritual experiences, including the sacrament and temple ordinances? How can you help others prepare? What do you learn about preparation from\nLuke 6:12–13\n;\nEnos 1:2–6\n;\nAlma 17:2–3\n?\nThis mountain in Egypt is traditionally believed to be Mount Sinai.\nExodus 20:1–17\nObedience to God’s commandments brings blessings.\nWhile the Israelites were gathered at the base of Mount Sinai, they heard the voice of God give the Ten Commandments (see\nDeuteronomy 4:12–13\n). These, of course, aren’t God’s only commandments—there are many others in the scriptures. So as you read\nExodus 20:1–17\n, ask yourself why God emphasized these ten in particular. Here’s a sample table you could use as you ponder the importance of the Ten Commandments in your life:\nCommandment\nIn other words, the Lord is asking me to …\nBlessings that come from living this commandment\nHow does keeping these ten commandments help you keep the two great commandments Jesus gave in\nMatthew 22:34–40\n?\nWhat are things that you may be tempted to put before God? What blessings have you seen from putting God first?\nHow would you respond to someone who says the Ten Commandments were given a long time ago and do not apply today? What examples from your life would you share as part of your response? How might the hymn “\nHow Gentle God’s Commands\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 125) affect the way you explain God’s commandments to others?\nHow has the Lord fulfilled the promise in\nExodus 20:6\nin your life?\nSee also “\nThe Great Commandment—Love the Lord\n,” in\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson\n(2014), 37–45; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nNo Other Gods\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 72–75; Topics and Questions, “\nCommandments\n,” Gospel Library.\nExodus 24:1–11\nMaking covenants shows my willingness to obey God’s law.\nAs you read\nExodus 24:3–8\n, consider the covenants you have made with God. While Israel’s covenant included rituals that are different from what God requires today, you may notice some similarities. For example,\nverses 4, 5, and 8\nmention an altar, animal sacrifices, and blood. What could these things represent, and how do they relate to your covenants?\nExodus 32–34\nSin is turning away from God; repentance is turning toward Him and away from evil.\nTry to put yourself in the Israelites’ place—you’re in the wilderness, Moses has been gone for 40 days, and a confrontation with the Canaanites over the promised land is in your future (see\nExodus 32:1–8\n). Why do you think the Israelites wanted a golden idol? What inspires you about Moses’s plea to the Lord in\nExodus 33:11–17\n?\nWhile the Israelites’ sin was serious, this story also includes a message of God’s mercy and forgiveness. What does\nExodus 34:1–10\nteach you about the Savior? (see\nExodus 32:30–32\n;\nMosiah 14:4–8\n;\n15:9\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:3–5\n).\nExodus 31:13–16\nThe Sabbath is a sign.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson explained: “In my much younger years, I studied the work of others who had compiled lists of things to do and things\nnot\nto do on the Sabbath. It wasn’t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a\nsign\nbetween me and my Heavenly Father [see\nExodus 31:13\n;\nEzekiel 20:12, 20\n].

      "title": "The Tabernacle and Sacrifice",
      "date_range": "",
      "intro": [
        "When God commanded Moses to build a tabernacle in the camp of the Israelites, He stated its purpose: “that I may dwell among them” ( Exodus 25:8 ). Within the tabernacle, the presence of God was represented by the ark of the covenant—a wooden box, covered with gold, containing the written record of God’s covenant with His people. The ark was kept in the holiest, innermost room, separated from the rest of the tabernacle by a veil. This veil can symbolize our separation from the presence of God because of the Fall, as well as our way back to Him—through the Savior.",
        "Other than Moses, we know of only one person who could enter that “most holy place” ( Exodus 26:34 )—the high priest. Like the other priests, he first had to be washed and anointed and dressed in sacred clothing symbolic of his office. Once a year, on a day called the Day of Atonement, the high priest would offer sacrifices on behalf of the people before entering the tabernacle alone. At the veil, he would burn incense. The scented smoke ascending to heaven represented the prayers of the people ascending to God. Then the high priest, carrying blood from an animal sacrifice, would pass through the veil and approach the throne of God, symbolized by the ark of the covenant.",
        "Knowing what you know about Jesus Christ and His role in Heavenly Father’s plan, can you see how the tabernacle points us to the Savior? Just as the tabernacle, and the ark within it, represented God’s presence among His people, Jesus Christ was God’s presence among His people. Like the high priest, Jesus Christ is the Mediator between us and God the Father. He passed through the veil to make intercession for us by virtue of the blood of His own sacrifice.",
        "Some aspects of Israel’s tabernacle may sound familiar to you, especially if you have been to the temple to receive your own ordinances. The temple is the house of the Lord—His dwelling place among His people. Like the tabernacle’s most holy place, the temple’s celestial room represents the presence of God. To enter, we must first be washed and anointed. We wear sacred clothing. We make covenants. We pray at an altar from which prayers ascend to God. And we finally pass through a veil into God’s presence.",
        "Perhaps the most important similarity between modern temples and the ancient tabernacle is that both, if understood correctly, strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ and fill us with gratitude for His atoning sacrifice. God wants all of His children to enter into His presence; He wants “a kingdom of priests” and priestesses ( Exodus 19:6 ). But our sins prevent us from obtaining that blessing, for “no unclean thing can dwell with God” ( 1 Nephi 10:21 ). So God the Father sent Jesus Christ, our “high priest of good things to come” ( Hebrews 9:11 ). He parts the veil for us and empowers all of God’s people to “come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy” ( Hebrews 4:16 ).",
        "Today, the purpose of temples is more than obtaining exaltation for ourselves. After receiving our own ordinances and making covenants with God, we can stand in the place of our ancestors and receive ordinances on their behalf. In a sense, we can become something like the ancient high priest—and the Great High Priest—opening the way to God’s presence for others.",
        "The principles of atonement and reconciliation are taught powerfully in the ancient practice of animal sacrifice, which existed long before the law of Moses. Adam and Eve offered sacrifice. They understood its symbolic reference to the Savior’s sacrifice. And they taught this to their children.",
        "The symbolism of animal sacrifice may have seemed especially poignant on ancient Israel’s Day of Atonement (“Yom Kippur” in Hebrew). The need for this annual ceremony was expressed in Leviticus 16:30 : “On that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.” This allowed God’s presence to remain among the people. This atonement was accomplished through a variety of ceremonies. In one of these, a goat was killed as an offering for the sins of the people, and the high priest took the goat’s blood into the most holy place. Later, the high priest laid his hands on a live goat and confessed the sins of the children of Israel—symbolically transferring those sins to the goat. The goat was then driven out of the camp of Israel.",
        "In these rituals, the goats symbolized Jesus Christ, taking the place of the sinful people. Sin must not be allowed in God’s presence. But rather than destroy or drive out the sinners, God provided another way—a goat would be killed or driven out instead. “And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities” ( Leviticus 16:22 ).",
        "These rituals pointed to the way God has provided to bring us back into His presence—Jesus Christ and His Atonement. The Savior has “borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” even “the iniquity of us all” ( Isaiah 53:4, 6 ). He stood in our place, gave His life to pay the penalty of sin, and then conquered death through His Resurrection. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ was the “great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast” but rather “an infinite and eternal sacrifice” ( Alma 34:10 ). He was the fulfillment of everything the ancient sacrifices pointed toward.",
        "For this reason, after His sacrifice was complete, He said, “Ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices … shall be done away. … And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit” ( 3 Nephi 9:19–20 ).",
        "So when you find passages in the Old Testament about sacrifices and the tabernacle (or, later, the temple)—and you’ll find a lot of them—remember that the primary purpose of it all is to strengthen your faith in the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Connect what you read and learn with your worship in His house. Let your heart and your mind turn to Him. Ponder what He has done to bring you back into God’s presence—and what you will do to follow Him."

            "When God commanded Moses to build a tabernacle in the camp of the Israelites, He stated its purpose: “that I may dwell among them” ( Exodus 25:8 ). Within the tabernacle, the presence of God was represented by the ark of the covenant—a wooden box, covered with gold, containing the written record of God’s covenant with His people. The ark was kept in the holiest, innermost room, separated from the rest of the tabernacle by a veil. This veil can symbolize our separation from the presence of God because of the Fall, as well as our way back to Him—through the Savior.",
            "Other than Moses, we know of only one person who could enter that “most holy place” ( Exodus 26:34 )—the high priest. Like the other priests, he first had to be washed and anointed and dressed in sacred clothing symbolic of his office. Once a year, on a day called the Day of Atonement, the high priest would offer sacrifices on behalf of the people before entering the tabernacle alone. At the veil, he would burn incense. The scented smoke ascending to heaven represented the prayers of the people ascending to God. Then the high priest, carrying blood from an animal sacrifice, would pass through the veil and approach the throne of God, symbolized by the ark of the covenant.",
            "Knowing what you know about Jesus Christ and His role in Heavenly Father’s plan, can you see how the tabernacle points us to the Savior? Just as the tabernacle, and the ark within it, represented God’s presence among His people, Jesus Christ was God’s presence among His people. Like the high priest, Jesus Christ is the Mediator between us and God the Father. He passed through the veil to make intercession for us by virtue of the blood of His own sacrifice.",
            "Some aspects of Israel’s tabernacle may sound familiar to you, especially if you have been to the temple to receive your own ordinances. The temple is the house of the Lord—His dwelling place among His people. Like the tabernacle’s most holy place, the temple’s celestial room represents the presence of God. To enter, we must first be washed and anointed. We wear sacred clothing. We make covenants. We pray at an altar from which prayers ascend to God. And we finally pass through a veil into God’s presence.",
            "Perhaps the most important similarity between modern temples and the ancient tabernacle is that both, if understood correctly, strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ and fill us with gratitude for His atoning sacrifice. God wants all of His children to enter into His presence; He wants “a kingdom of priests” and priestesses ( Exodus 19:6 ). But our sins prevent us from obtaining that blessing, for “no unclean thing can dwell with God” ( 1 Nephi 10:21 ). So God the Father sent Jesus Christ, our “high priest of good things to come” ( Hebrews 9:11 ). He parts the veil for us and empowers all of God’s people to “come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy” ( Hebrews 4:16 ).",
            "Today, the purpose of temples is more than obtaining exaltation for ourselves. After receiving our own ordinances and making covenants with God, we can stand in the place of our ancestors and receive ordinances on their behalf. In a sense, we can become something like the ancient high priest—and the Great High Priest—opening the way to God’s presence for others."

            "The principles of atonement and reconciliation are taught powerfully in the ancient practice of animal sacrifice, which existed long before the law of Moses. Adam and Eve offered sacrifice. They understood its symbolic reference to the Savior’s sacrifice. And they taught this to their children.",
            "The symbolism of animal sacrifice may have seemed especially poignant on ancient Israel’s Day of Atonement (“Yom Kippur” in Hebrew). The need for this annual ceremony was expressed in Leviticus 16:30 : “On that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.” This allowed God’s presence to remain among the people. This atonement was accomplished through a variety of ceremonies. In one of these, a goat was killed as an offering for the sins of the people, and the high priest took the goat’s blood into the most holy place. Later, the high priest laid his hands on a live goat and confessed the sins of the children of Israel—symbolically transferring those sins to the goat. The goat was then driven out of the camp of Israel.",
            "In these rituals, the goats symbolized Jesus Christ, taking the place of the sinful people. Sin must not be allowed in God’s presence. But rather than destroy or drive out the sinners, God provided another way—a goat would be killed or driven out instead. “And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities” ( Leviticus 16:22 ).",
            "These rituals pointed to the way God has provided to bring us back into His presence—Jesus Christ and His Atonement. The Savior has “borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” even “the iniquity of us all” ( Isaiah 53:4, 6 ). He stood in our place, gave His life to pay the penalty of sin, and then conquered death through His Resurrection. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ was the “great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast” but rather “an infinite and eternal sacrifice” ( Alma 34:10 ). He was the fulfillment of everything the ancient sacrifices pointed toward.",
            "For this reason, after His sacrifice was complete, He said, “Ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices … shall be done away. … And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit” ( 3 Nephi 9:19–20 ).",
            "So when you find passages in the Old Testament about sacrifices and the tabernacle (or, later, the temple)—and you’ll find a lot of them—remember that the primary purpose of it all is to strengthen your faith in the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Connect what you read and learn with your worship in His house. Let your heart and your mind turn to Him. Ponder what He has done to bring you back into God’s presence—and what you will do to follow Him."

These chapters describe in detail Israel’s tabernacle in the wilderness and the animal sacrifices to be performed there.\nThe tabernacle was a portable temple, the Lord’s dwelling place among His people.\nOur modern temples share similarities with Israel’s tabernacle, but they certainly don’t match its description in Exodus. And we don’t kill animals in our temples—the Savior’s Atonement ended animal sacrifice almost 2,000 years ago. Yet despite these differences, there is great value today in reading about ancient Israel’s forms of worship, especially if we see them as God’s people in the Book of Mormon did—as a way “to strengthen their faith in Christ” (\nAlma 25:16\n).\nWhen we understand the symbolism of the tabernacle and animal sacrifice, we can gain spiritual insights that will also strengthen our faith in Christ.\nSacrifice of a Lamb\n, by Robert T. Barrett\nThe Tabernacle Strengthens Faith in Jesus Christ\nWhen God commanded Moses to build a tabernacle in the camp of the Israelites, He stated its purpose: “that I may dwell among them” (\nExodus 25:8\n). Within the tabernacle, the presence of God was represented by the ark of the covenant—a wooden box, covered with gold, containing the written record of God’s covenant with His people.\nThe ark was kept in the holiest, innermost room, separated from the rest of the tabernacle by a veil. This veil can symbolize our separation from the presence of God because of the Fall, as well as our way back to Him—through the Savior.\nOther than Moses, we know of only one person who could enter that “most holy place” (\nExodus 26:34\n)—the high priest. Like the other priests, he first had to be washed and anointed\nand dressed in sacred clothing symbolic of his office.\nOnce a year, on a day called the Day of Atonement, the high priest would offer sacrifices on behalf of the people before entering the tabernacle alone. At the veil, he would burn incense.\nThe scented smoke ascending to heaven represented the prayers of the people ascending to God.\nThen the high priest, carrying blood from an animal sacrifice, would pass through the veil and approach the throne of God, symbolized by the ark of the covenant.\nKnowing what you know about Jesus Christ and His role in Heavenly Father’s plan, can you see how the tabernacle points us to the Savior? Just as the tabernacle, and the ark within it, represented God’s presence among His people, Jesus Christ\nwas\nGod’s presence among His people.\nLike the high priest, Jesus Christ is the Mediator between us and God the Father. He passed through the veil to make intercession for us by virtue of the blood of His own sacrifice.\nSome aspects of Israel’s tabernacle may sound familiar to you, especially if you have been to the temple to receive your own ordinances. The temple is the house of the Lord—His dwelling place among His people. Like the tabernacle’s most holy place, the temple’s celestial room represents the presence of God. To enter, we must first be washed and anointed. We wear sacred clothing. We make covenants. We pray at an altar from which prayers ascend to God. And we finally pass through a veil into God’s presence.\nPerhaps the most important similarity between modern temples and the ancient tabernacle is that both, if understood correctly, strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ and fill us with gratitude for His atoning sacrifice. God wants all of His children to enter into His presence; He wants “a kingdom of priests” and priestesses (\nExodus 19:6\n). But our sins prevent us from obtaining that blessing, for “no unclean thing can dwell with God” (\n1 Nephi 10:21\n). So God the Father sent Jesus Christ, our “high priest of good things to come” (\nHebrews 9:11\n). He parts the veil for us and empowers\nall\nof God’s people to “come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy” (\nHebrews 4:16\n).\nToday, the purpose of temples is more than obtaining exaltation for ourselves. After receiving our own ordinances and making covenants with God, we can stand in the place of our ancestors and receive ordinances on their behalf. In a sense, we can become something like the ancient high priest—and the Great High Priest—opening the way to God’s presence for others.\nSacrifice Strengthens Faith in Jesus Christ\nThe principles of atonement and reconciliation are taught powerfully in the ancient practice of animal sacrifice, which existed long before the law of Moses. Adam and Eve offered sacrifice. They understood its symbolic reference to the Savior’s sacrifice. And they taught this to their children.\nThe symbolism of animal sacrifice may have seemed especially poignant on ancient Israel’s Day of Atonement (“Yom Kippur” in Hebrew). The need for this annual ceremony was expressed in\nLeviticus 16:30\n: “On that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.” This allowed God’s presence to remain among the people. This atonement was accomplished through a variety of ceremonies. In one of these, a goat was killed as an offering for the sins of the people, and the high priest took the goat’s blood into the most holy place. Later, the high priest laid his hands on a live goat and confessed the sins of the children of Israel—symbolically transferring those sins to the goat. The goat was then driven out of the camp of Israel.\nIn these rituals, the goats symbolized Jesus Christ, taking the place of the sinful people. Sin must not be allowed in God’s presence. But rather than destroy or drive out the sinners, God provided another way—a goat would be killed or driven out instead. “And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities” (\nLeviticus 16:22\n).\nThese rituals pointed to the way God has provided to bring us back into His presence—Jesus Christ and His Atonement. The Savior has “borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” even “the iniquity of us all” (\nIsaiah 53:4, 6\n). He stood in our place, gave His life to pay the penalty of sin, and then conquered death through His Resurrection.\nThe sacrifice of Jesus Christ was the “great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast” but rather “an infinite and eternal sacrifice” (\nAlma 34:10\n). He was the fulfillment of everything the ancient sacrifices pointed toward.\nFor this reason, after His sacrifice was complete, He said, “Ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices … shall be done away. … And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit” (\n3 Nephi 9:19–20\n).\nSo when you find passages in the Old Testament about sacrifices and the tabernacle (or, later, the temple)—and you’ll find a lot of them—remember that the primary purpose of it all is to strengthen your faith in the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Connect what you read and learn with your worship in His house. Let your heart and your mind turn to Him. Ponder what He has done to bring you back into God’s presence—and what you will do to follow Him.\nNotes\nExodus 33:7–11\nmentions a “tabernacle of the congregation,” where Moses communicated with the Lord, but this was not the setting for the sacrifices described in Exodus and Leviticus. Those sacrifices were performed in the tabernacle described in\nExodus 25–30\n, which God commanded Moses and the children of Israel to build (see\nExodus 35–40\n). This tabernacle, where Aaron and his sons performed animal sacrifices, was also often referred to as the “tabernacle of the congregation” (see, for example,\nExodus 28:43\n;\n38:30\n;\nLeviticus 1:3\n).\nSee also\nJacob 4:5\n;\nJarom 1:11\n.\nSee\nExodus 25:10–22\n.\nSee\nHebrews 10:19–20\n.\nSee\nExodus 40:12–13\n.\nSee\nExodus 28\n.\nSee\nLeviticus 16:12\n.\nSee\nPsalm 141:2\n.\nSee\nLeviticus 16:14–15\n.\nSee\nJohn 1:14\n.\nSee\nHebrews 8–10\n.\nSee\nMoses 5:4–12\n; see also\nGenesis 4:4\n.\nSee\nMosiah 15:8–9\n."

Even a comfortable life in the promised land wasn’t God’s ultimate goal for them. These were only steps toward what God really wanted for His people: “Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy” (\nLeviticus 19:2\n). How did God plan to make His people holy after they had lived in captivity for generations? He commanded them to create a place of holiness in the wilderness—a tabernacle. He gave them covenants and laws to guide their actions and change their hearts. And He commanded them to make animal sacrifices to teach them about atonement for their sins. All of this was meant to point their minds, hearts, and lives toward the Savior. He is the true path to holiness, for the Israelites and for us. We have all spent some time in the captivity of sin, and we are all invited to leave sin behind and follow Jesus Christ, who has promised, “I am able to make you holy” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 60:7\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Leviticus, see “\nLeviticus\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nExodus 35–40\n;\nLeviticus 19\nThe Lord wants me to become holy.\nExodus 35–40\ndescribes the Israelites’ efforts to build a tabernacle, where sacred ordinances would help them become a holy people. As you read these chapters, look for the things the Lord asked His people to place in the tabernacle. What might these items represent? What do they suggest to you about increasing in holiness? Especially consider how these items turn your thoughts toward the Savior. A table like this might help you:\nWhat object did you find?\nWhat can this represent?\nWhat object did you find?\nArk of the covenant (\nExodus 37:1–9\n;\n40:20–21\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\nExodus 25:20–22\n; Guide to the Scriptures, “\nArk of the Covenant\n”)\nWhat object did you find?\nAltar of incense (\nExodus 40:26–27\n; see also\nExodus 30:1, 6–8\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\nRevelation 8:3–4\n)\nWhat object did you find?\nCandlestick or lampstand (\nExodus 37:17–24\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\nMatthew 5:14–16\n;\nJohn 8:12\n)\nWhat object did you find?\nAltar of sacrifice (\nExodus 38:1–7\n; see also\nExodus 27:1\n;\n29:10–14\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See Guide to the Scriptures, “\nSacrifice\n”)\nWhat object did you find?\nLaver (basin) of water (\nExodus 30:17–21\n)\nWhat can this represent?\n(See\n2 Chronicles 4:6\n;\nIsaiah 1:16\n;\nJeremiah 33:8\n)\nOf course, simply being in holy places doesn’t make us holy.\nLeviticus 19\ndescribes laws and commandments the Lord gave to help the Israelites increase in holiness. What do you find in these commandments that could help you seek holiness from the Lord? What do you feel impressed to do to more fully live these principles?\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “\nHoliness and the Plan of Happiness\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 100–103; “The Tabernacle” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Tabernacle\nUse sacred music.\nMusic has great power to invite the influence of the Spirit and build faith in Jesus Christ. The messages in hymns often reinforce the doctrine in the scriptures. For instance, singing a hymn like “\nMore Holiness Give Me\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 131) can reinforce some of the messages taught in\nLeviticus 19\n. It can also help you think about what it means to become more holy like the Savior and ponder how He is helping you increase in holiness.\nExodus 35:4–35\n;\n36:1–7\nThe Lord asks me to make my offerings with a willing heart.\nIn the year after leaving Egypt, the relationship of the children of Israel with Jehovah could be described as inconsistent.

It also ended on a mountain, more than 40 years later, when God gave him a glimpse of the promised land from the top of Mount Nebo (see\nDeuteronomy 34:1–4\n). Moses had spent his life preparing the children of Israel to enter that promised land, and the book of Deuteronomy records his final instructions, reminders, exhortations, and pleadings with the Israelites. Reading his words makes it clear that the real object of Moses’s ministry—the preparation the people needed—wasn’t about wilderness survival, conquering enemies, or building a nation. It was about learning to love God, obey Him, and remain loyal to Him. That’s the preparation we all need to enter the promised land of eternal life. So although Moses never set foot in the “land flowing with milk and honey” (\nExodus 3:8\n), because of his faith and faithfulness, he did enter the promised land that God has prepared for all those who follow Him.\nFor an overview of Deuteronomy, see “\nDeuteronomy\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDeuteronomy 6:4–7\n;\n8:2–5, 11–17\n;\n29:18–20\n;\n30:6–10, 14–20\n“Love the Lord thy God with all thine heart.”\nThe law of Moses included many outward ceremonies and rituals. As you’ll see in Moses’s counsel in Deuteronomy, the Lord was also concerned about His people’s inward state—the spiritual condition of their hearts.\nIn the passages below, look for the word\nheart\n, and ponder what it might symbolize. You might think of these passages as a kind of spiritual checkup on your heart. What diagnosis would you give yourself? What treatments would you prescribe to improve the spiritual health of your heart? Write down your impressions:\nDeuteronomy 6:4–7\n:\nDeuteronomy 8:2–5\n:\nDeuteronomy 8:11–17\n:\nDeuteronomy 29:18–20\n:\nDeuteronomy 30:6–10\n:\nDeuteronomy 30:14–20\n:\nOne way to organize your thoughts could be to draw a heart and write inside it things that the Lord says you should have in your heart. Then you could write outside it things that you should keep out of your heart.\nHow do you show that you love God with all your heart? For ideas, see “\nLove God, love your neighbor\n” in\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 10–12.\nSee also M. Russell Ballard, “\nLovest Thou Me More Than These?\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 51–53.\nSeek your own spiritual insights.\nCome, Follow Me\nsuggests passages and principles to focus on in the scriptures, but don’t let that limit your study.

Moses knew that they—and future generations—would need to remember God’s miracles and God’s laws to remain God’s people.\nWhat counsel do you find in\nDeuteronomy 6:4–12, 20–25\nthat could help you remember the great things God has done for you?

How do we show the Lord that we love Him with all our heart, soul, and might?\nDeuteronomy 6:6–15\nI can keep the word of God in my heart.\nRead with your children the Lord’s counsel to the Israelites to put scripture passages where they would see them every day (see\nDeuteronomy 6:6–9\n). This might inspire you and your children to think of ways to make sure you don’t “forget the Lord” (\nverse 12\n) and to remember what He has done for you.\nYou might point out that\nDeuteronomy 6:13, 16\nand\n8:3\nhelped the Savior during an important moment in His life.

Then you could share with each other some scripture passages that have helped you in times of need.\nDeuteronomy 18:15–18\nProphets teach us about Jesus Christ.\nAs you read\nDeuteronomy 18:18\ntogether, help your children understand that the Prophet like Moses in this verse is Jesus Christ. Maybe you could look at pictures of things Moses did and things Jesus Christ did, and let your children match them (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 15\n,\n16\n,\n38\n,\n39\n). What has our prophet today taught us about the Savior?\nDeuteronomy 29:12–13\n;\n30:8–10\nBecause of my covenants, I am part of God’s people.\nTalking about\nDeuteronomy 29:12–13\nprovides an opportunity for you and your children to talk about covenants they will make or have made with Heavenly Father. What does it mean to be God’s people? How do our promises make us God’s people? (see\nverse 13\n; see also\nMosiah 18:8–10\n).\nIf your children need help understanding what a covenant is, suggest that they find a definition in “\nCovenant\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library). What promises did God and the Israelites make with each other in\nDeuteronomy 30:8–10\n? What promises have we made with God? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37, 77\n). How do these promises connect us with Him?

        "Naturally, these stories are told from a certain point of view. Just as it’s impossible to look at a flower, rock, or tree from more than one angle at a time, it’s inevitable that a historical account will reflect the perspective of the person or group of people writing it. This perspective includes the writers’ national or ethnic ties and their cultural norms and beliefs. Knowing this can help us understand that the writers and compilers of the historical books focused on certain details while leaving out others. They made assumptions that others would not have made. And they came to conclusions based on these details and assumptions. We can even see different perspectives across the books of the Bible (and sometimes within the same book). The more we’re aware of these perspectives, the better we can understand the historical books.",
        "One perspective common to all the Old Testament historical books is the perspective of the children of Israel, God’s covenant people. Their faith in the Lord helped them see His hand in their lives and in the affairs of their nation. While secular history books don’t tend to see things this way, this spiritual perspective is part of what makes the Old Testament historical books so valuable to people who are seeking to build their own faith in God.",
        "The historical books begin where the book of Deuteronomy leaves off, with the Israelites’ years of wandering in the wilderness about to end. The book of Joshua shows the children of Israel ready to enter Canaan, their promised land, and describes how they took it over. The books that follow, Judges through 2 Chronicles, depict Israel’s experience in the promised land, from the time they settled it until the time they were conquered by Assyria and Babylon. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah tell of the return of several groups of Israelites to their capital, Jerusalem, decades later. Finally, the book of Esther relates a story of Israelites living in exile under Persian rule.",
        "And that’s where the chronology of the Old Testament ends. Some first-time Bible readers are surprised to find that they’ve actually finished reading the story of the Old Testament before they’ve read much more than half its pages. After Esther, we don’t get much information about the history of the Israelites. Instead, the books that follow—especially the books of the prophets—fit within the timeline that the historical books presented. The ministry of the prophet Jeremiah, for example, took place during the events recorded in 2 Kings 22–25 (and the parallel account in 2 Chronicles 34–36 ). Knowing this can influence the way you read both the historical narratives and the prophetic books.",
        "When reading the Old Testament, as with any history, you’re likely to read about people doing or saying things that, to modern eyes, seem strange or even troubling. We should expect this—Old Testament writers saw the world from a perspective that was, in some ways, quite different from ours. Violence, ethnic relations, and the roles of women are just some of the issues that ancient writers might have seen differently than we do today.",
        "So what should we do when we come across passages in the scriptures that seem troubling? First, it might help to consider each passage in a broader context. How does it fit in God’s plan of salvation? How does it fit with what you know about the nature of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How does it fit with revealed truths in other scriptures or with the teachings of living prophets? And how does it fit with the whisperings of the Spirit to your own heart and mind?",
        "In some cases, the passage may not seem to fit well with any of these. Sometimes the passage may be like a puzzle piece that doesn’t look like it has a place among the pieces you’ve already assembled. Trying to force the piece to fit isn’t the best approach. But neither is giving up on the entire puzzle. Instead, you may need to set the piece aside for a time. As you learn more and put together more of the puzzle, you may be able to better see how the pieces fit together.",
        "It can also help to remember that in addition to being limited to a particular perspective, scriptural histories are subject to human error. For example, over the centuries, “many plain and precious things [were] taken away from the [Bible],” including important truths about doctrine, ordinances, and covenants ( 1 Nephi 13:28 ; see also verses 26, 29, 40 ). At the same time, we should be willing to admit that our own perspectives are also limited: there will always be things we don’t fully understand and questions we can’t yet answer.",
        "But in the meantime, unanswered questions shouldn’t keep us from the precious gems of eternal truth that are found in the Old Testament—even if these gems are sometimes hidden in the rocky ground of troubling experiences and poor choices made by imperfect people. Perhaps the most precious of these gems are the stories and passages that testify of God’s love—especially those that point our minds toward the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Viewed from any angle, gems like these shine just as brightly today as they did back then. And because these accounts tell of the covenant people of God—men and women who had human weaknesses and yet loved and served the Lord—gems of truth abound in the historical books of the Old Testament."

This doesn’t mean that other books in the Old Testament don’t have historical value. Rather, the historical books are called that because their writers’ main objective was to show God’s hand in the history of the people of Israel. The purpose was not to outline the law of Moses, as Leviticus and Deuteronomy do. It was not to express praise or lament in poetic form, as the Psalms and Lamentations do. And it was not to record the words of prophets, as the books of Isaiah and Ezekiel do. Instead, the historical books tell stories.\nA Matter of Perspective\nNaturally, these stories are told from a certain point of view. Just as it’s impossible to look at a flower, rock, or tree from more than one angle at a time, it’s inevitable that a historical account will reflect the perspective of the person or group of people writing it. This perspective includes the writers’ national or ethnic ties and their cultural norms and beliefs. Knowing this can help us understand that the writers and compilers of the historical books focused on certain details while leaving out others.\nThey made assumptions that others would not have made. And they came to conclusions based on these details and assumptions. We can even see different perspectives across the books of the Bible (and sometimes within the same book).\nThe more we’re aware of these perspectives, the better we can understand the historical books.\nOne perspective common to all the Old Testament historical books is the perspective of the children of Israel, God’s covenant people. Their faith in the Lord helped them see His hand in their lives and in the affairs of their nation. While secular history books don’t tend to see things this way, this spiritual perspective is part of what makes the Old Testament historical books so valuable to people who are seeking to build their own faith in God.\nContext for the Rest of the Old Testament\nThe historical books begin where the book of Deuteronomy leaves off, with the Israelites’ years of wandering in the wilderness about to end. The book of Joshua shows the children of Israel ready to enter Canaan, their promised land, and describes how they took it over. The books that follow, Judges through 2 Chronicles, depict Israel’s experience in the promised land, from the time they settled it until the time they were conquered by Assyria and Babylon. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah tell of the return of several groups of Israelites to their capital, Jerusalem, decades later. Finally, the book of Esther relates a story of Israelites living in exile under Persian rule.\nAnd that’s where the chronology of the Old Testament ends. Some first-time Bible readers are surprised to find that they’ve actually finished reading the\nstory\nof the Old Testament before they’ve read much more than half its pages. After Esther, we don’t get much information about the history of the Israelites. Instead, the books that follow—especially the books of the prophets—fit\nwithin\nthe timeline that the historical books presented.\nThe ministry of the prophet Jeremiah, for example, took place during the events recorded in\n2 Kings 22–25\n(and the parallel account in\n2 Chronicles 34–36\n). Knowing this can influence the way you read both the historical narratives and the prophetic books.\nWhen Something Doesn’t Fit\nWhen reading the Old Testament, as with any history, you’re likely to read about people doing or saying things that, to modern eyes, seem strange or even troubling. We should expect this—Old Testament writers saw the world from a perspective that was, in some ways, quite different from ours. Violence, ethnic relations, and the roles of women are just some of the issues that ancient writers might have seen differently than we do today.\nSo what should we do when we come across passages in the scriptures that seem troubling? First, it might help to consider each passage in a broader context. How does it fit in God’s plan of salvation? How does it fit with what you know about the nature of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How does it fit with revealed truths in other scriptures or with the teachings of living prophets? And how does it fit with the whisperings of the Spirit to your own heart and mind?\nIn some cases, the passage may not seem to fit well with any of these. Sometimes the passage may be like a puzzle piece that doesn’t look like it has a place among the pieces you’ve already assembled. Trying to force the piece to fit isn’t the best approach. But neither is giving up on the entire puzzle. Instead, you may need to set the piece aside for a time. As you learn more and put together more of the puzzle, you may be able to better see how the pieces fit together.\nIt can also help to remember that in addition to being limited to a particular perspective, scriptural histories are subject to human error.\nFor example, over the centuries, “many plain and precious things [were] taken away from the [Bible],” including important truths about doctrine, ordinances, and covenants (\n1 Nephi 13:28\n; see also\nverses 26, 29, 40\n). At the same time, we should be willing to admit that our own perspectives are also limited: there will always be things we don’t fully understand and questions we can’t yet answer.\nSome scripture passages may be like puzzle pieces that we don’t know how to fit with the rest of the puzzle.\nFinding the Gems\nBut in the meantime, unanswered questions shouldn’t keep us from the precious gems of eternal truth that are found in the Old Testament—even if these gems are sometimes hidden in the rocky ground of troubling experiences and poor choices made by imperfect people. Perhaps the most precious of these gems are the stories and passages that testify of God’s love—especially those that point our minds toward the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Viewed from any angle, gems like these shine just as brightly today as they did back then. And because these accounts tell of the covenant people of God—men and women who had human weaknesses and yet loved and served the Lord—gems of truth abound in the historical books of the Old Testament.\nNotes\nThe historical narratives of the Bible we have today are primarily the work of many unnamed writers and compilers, who sometimes worked many years, even centuries, after the time periods they describe. They relied on a variety of historical sources and made decisions about what to include in their accounts and what to exclude.\nFor example, although 1–2 Chronicles covers roughly the same period as 1 Samuel 31 through the end of 2 Kings, the account in 1–2 Chronicles emphasizes different details and presents a different perspective, focusing almost solely on the Southern Kingdom of Judah and often omitting negative stories about David and Solomon (compare, for example,\n2 Samuel 10–12\nwith\n1 Chronicles 19–20\nand\n1 Kings 10–11\nwith\n2 Chronicles 9\n).\nCome, Follow Me\nemphasizes studying the account in 1 and 2 Kings, though there is value in comparing that account with 1 and 2 Chronicles. It might be helpful to know that work on 1 Samuel–2 Kings likely began before the Babylonian empire conquered Judah and was completed during the exile in Babylon. The record that became 1–2 Chronicles, on the other hand, was compiled after the Jews returned to Jerusalem from their exile. As you read, you might consider how these different circumstances could have affected the perspectives of the compilers of the different accounts.\nToward the beginning of this resource you will find the “\nOld Testament Overview\n,” a timeline that shows how the ministry of each prophet fits into the history of Israel (as well as can be determined). You’ll notice that most of the prophetic books of the Old Testament fall near the end of that timeline—just before and just after the children of Israel were conquered, exiled, and scattered by their enemies.\nSee\nArticles of Faith 1:8\n."

But in their way stood the Jordan River, the walls of Jericho, and a mighty people who had rejected the Lord (see\n1 Nephi 17:35\n). And they would have to face all of that without their beloved leader Moses. The situation may have made some Israelites feel weak and fearful, but the Lord said, “Be strong and of a good courage.” What reason did they have to be courageous? It wasn’t because of their own strength—or even Moses’s or Joshua’s—but because “the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest” (\nJoshua 1:9\n). When we have our own rivers to cross and walls to bring down, wonderful things can happen in our lives because “the Lord will do wonders among [us]” (\nJoshua 3:5\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Joshua, see “\nJoshua, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJoshua 1:1–9\nGod will be with me as I strive to be faithful to Him.\nImagine what it might have been like for Joshua to be called to replace Moses.

But too often we forget our earlier resolve, and, when temptation comes, we find ourselves committing the same sin. This pattern appears frequently in the book of Judges. Influenced by the beliefs and worship practices of the Canaanites—whom they were supposed to drive out of the land—the Israelites broke their covenants with the Lord and turned away from worshipping Him. As a result, they lost His protection and fell into captivity. And yet each time this happened, the Lord gave His covenant people the chance to repent and raised up a deliverer, a military leader called a “judge.” Not all of the judges in the book of Judges were righteous, but some of them exercised great faith in delivering the children of Israel and restoring them to their covenant relationship with the Lord. These stories remind us that no matter what has led us away from Jesus Christ, He is the Redeemer of Israel and is always willing to deliver us and welcome us back as we return to Him.\nFor an overview of the book of Judges, see “\nJudges, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJudges 2:1–19\n;\n3:5–12\nThe Lord forgives as often as I repent.\nThe book of Judges can be both a warning and an encouragement. Look for this warning and encouragement as you read\nJudges 2:1–19\n;\n3:5–12\n. How do you feel the warning and encouragement apply to you?\nFor example, if\nJudges 2:19\nwere about you and your temptations rather than about the ancient Israelites, what might it say? If\nJudges 3:9\nwere about what the Lord had done to deliver you, what might it say?\nConsider reading the question and answer on\npage 9\nof\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n. How do you feel this applies to the Israelites’ experience in the book of Judges? What does this teach you about Jesus Christ?\nJudges 4:1–15\nI can inspire others to have faith in the Lord.\nSometimes the faith of one person can inspire faith in many others. In\nJudges 4\n, that one person was Deborah. Read about her in\nJudges 4:1–15\n, and note the influence she had on people around her. Here are some questions to help you consider how her experience might apply to your life:\nHow would you describe the conditions the Israelites were in at the time? (see\nverses 1–3\n). What similarities do you see to conditions today—in individuals and society?\nWhat words or actions of Deborah show you that she had faith in the Lord? How did her faith influence others? What else impresses you about her?\nWhat do you think Deborah meant by her question in\nverse 14\n: “Is not the Lord gone out before thee?” How does the Lord “go out before” you? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:87–88\n).\nPonder how your faith in Jesus Christ could bless others the way Deborah’s faith blessed Barak and the other Israelites.

Search the message for (1) reasons to speak more openly about the Savior and (2) ways to do it.\nThen you might make a list of things you know about Jesus Christ—from the scriptures, from words of living prophets, and from your personal experience. Who needs to know this? How will you share it?\nSee also\nMatthew 5:14–16\n;\n1 Peter 3:15\n; “\nEach Life That Touches Ours for Good\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 293.\nInvite sharing.\nIf you are a teacher—at home or at church—“give learners opportunities to share with each other what they are learning about the Savior and His gospel. Doing this will help them internalize the truths they are taught and express them” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n26\n). For example, when studying\nJudges 4\ntogether, you could give each learner something specific to look for in the chapter and then invite them to share with each other what they find.\nJudges 6–8\nThe Lord can work miracles when I trust in His ways.\nAs you read\nJudges 6–8\n, make note of instances where the Lord asked Gideon to believe something that might have seemed unlikely. Has He ever asked something similar of you?\nWhat do you feel the Lord is trying to teach you with this account? How have you seen the Lord do His work in ways that seemed unlikely?\nJudges 13–16\nGod strengthens me as I am faithful to my covenants.\nSamson lost both his physical strength and his spiritual strength because he violated his covenants with God, including those that applied specifically to Nazarites (for information about the Nazarites, see\nNumbers 6:1–6\n;\nJudges 13:7\n). As you read about Samson in\nJudges 13–16\n, note verses that show that the Lord was with Samson, as well as verses showing that Samson was not fully committed to the Lord.\nYou might also ponder the covenants you have made with the Lord. How have these covenants brought His power into your life? What do you learn from Samson’s experiences that inspires you to stay true to your covenants with God?\nSister Ann M. Dibb taught: “Samson was born with great potential. His mother was promised, ‘He shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines’ [\nJudges 13:5\n]. But as Samson grew, he looked more to the world’s temptations than to God’s direction. He made choices because they ‘pleaseth [him] well’ [\nJudges 14:3\n] rather than because those choices were right. Repeatedly, the scriptures use the phrase ‘and he went down’ [\nJudges 14:7\n] as they tell of Samson’s journeys, actions, and choices. Instead of arising and shining forth to fulfill his great potential, Samson was overcome by the world, lost his God-given power, and died a tragic, early death” (“\nArise and Shine Forth\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2012, 118).\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nCovenants and Responsibilities\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 93–96; Ulisses Soares, “\nCovenant Confidence through Jesus Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 17–21.\nScripture Helps\nWhat were some of the false gods of the Canaanites?\nWhat does it mean that Deborah was a prophetess?\nWas it appropriate for Gideon to ask God for a sign?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the first Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “Appendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path.”\nJudges 3:7–9, 12–15\nJesus Christ is my Deliverer.\nJudges 3\ndescribes a pattern that teaches about the Savior’s power to deliver us from sin. To help your children identify this pattern, you could write down these phrases: “did evil,” “cried unto the Lord,” and “raised up a deliverer.” Then your children could look for these phrases in\nJudges 3:7–9\nand\nJudges 3:12–15\n. What do we learn about the Lord from this pattern?\nTo emphasize that Jesus Christ is our Deliverer, you could gather several pictures of people, including a picture of Jesus, and place them face down. Let your children take turns flipping over the pictures. When they find the picture of Jesus, sing a song about Him, such as “\nHe Sent His Son\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 34–35), and tell your children about how He has delivered you.\nJudges 4:1–15\nI can inspire others to have faith in the Lord.\nYou can use “\nDeborah the Prophetess\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 92–95, to tell your children the story in\nJudges 4\n. Share with each other what you admire about Deborah. How did her faith in the Lord bless the people around her? What can we do to help others have more faith in Jesus Christ?\nDeborah the Prophetess\nJudges 7:1–21\nThe Lord can use small things to do great work.\nUse\nJudges 7:4–7\n, this week’s activity page, or “\nThe Army of Gideon\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 96–99, to teach your children about how the Lord made Israel’s army smaller. Why did the Lord want Gideon’s army to be so small? (see\nJudges 7:2\n).\nThe Army of Gideon\nYour children could draw pictures of a sword, shield, trumpet, lamp, and pitcher and talk about which of these objects they would want in a battle. Then they could read\nJudges 7:16\nto learn what the Lord told Gideon’s army to use. As you read about the battle in\nJudges 7:19–21\n, share with each other what you learn about the Lord from this story.\nSamson Puts Down the Pillars\n, by James Tissot and others\nJudges 13:5\nKeeping covenants gives me strength.\nSamson’s covenants with the Lord gave him physical strength, just as our covenants give us spiritual strength. Your children might enjoy doing some physical exercises and discussing how those exercises can help make our bodies strong. How does keeping our covenants make our spirits strong? (see\nMosiah 18:8–10\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nGideon’s Army\n, by Daniel A. Lewis\nOpen PDF"

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, after all. And yet life is often full of delays and detours that take us in unexpected directions.\nRuth and Hannah surely understood this. Ruth was not an Israelite, but she married one, and when her husband died, she had a choice to make. Would she return to her family and her old, familiar life, or would she embrace the Israelite faith and a new home with her mother-in-law? (see\nRuth 1:4–18\n). Hannah’s plan for her life was to bear children, but she could not, and that left her “in bitterness of soul” (see\n1 Samuel 1:1–10\n). As you read about Ruth and Hannah, consider the faith they must have had to travel their unexpected paths. Then think about your own journey. It’s different from Ruth’s and Hannah’s—and anyone else’s. But throughout the trials and surprises between here and your eternal destination, you can learn to say with Hannah, “My heart rejoiceth in the Lord” (\n1 Samuel 2:1\n).\nSee also the Bible Dictionary for an overview of the books of\nRuth\nand\n1 Samuel\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nRuth\nJesus Christ can turn tragedy into triumph.\nLife is hard for a widow in any era. But when Ruth’s husband died, her situation was especially hard. In Israelite culture at the time, a woman without a husband or sons had no right to property and very few ways to earn a living. As you read Ruth’s story, notice how the Lord turned tragedy into great blessings. What do you notice about Ruth that might have helped her? How did Boaz redeem Ruth from her desperate situation? (see\nRuth 4:4–10\n). How were both Ruth and Boaz like Jesus Christ?\nSee also “\nBe Still, My Soul\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 124.\nRuth\n;\n1 Samuel 1\nI can trust that God will guide and help me regardless of my situation.\nPerhaps you have suffered a great loss, as Ruth and Naomi did (see\nRuth 1:1–5\n). Or maybe, like Hannah, you long for blessings you have not yet received (see\n1 Samuel 1:1–10\n). How did these women show their faith in God? What do you learn from their examples?\nOf course, not everyone who prays for a child receives one, and not everyone whose spouse dies remarries. But everyone who turns to the Savior receives His help and guidance. Consider how you have “come to trust” the Lord (\nRuth 2:12\n) during your difficult times.\nSee also Amy A. Wright, “\nAbide the Day in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 9–11.\nFor This Child I Prayed\n, by Elspeth Young\n1 Samuel 2\n;\n4–7\nTo receive the Lord’s help, I need to trust Him and obey His commandments.\nWhen their enemies attacked, the Israelites apparently thought that simply possessing the ark of the covenant would protect them. As you read\n1 Samuel 4–6\n, think about why that didn’t work. (Note also the unrighteous actions of Eli’s sons, who served as priests in the tabernacle, in\n1 Samuel 2:12–25\n.) What do you think the Lord was trying to teach His people? What do you learn from what happened to the Philistines after capturing the ark? (see\nchapters 5–6\n). What do you learn from Israel’s efforts to regain the Lord’s protection in\n1 Samuel 7\n?\nYou might be inspired by reading Hannah’s poem of praise in\n1 Samuel 2:1–10\n. What do you find in her words that could have helped Eli’s sons and the rest of the Israelites?\n1 Samuel 3\nI can hear and obey the voice of the Lord.\nAt times, you may feel like Samuel, who heard the voice of the Lord but did not recognize it. Like all of us, Samuel had to learn how to recognize the Lord’s voice. As you study\n1 Samuel 3\n, what do you learn from this young boy about hearing and obeying the Lord’s voice? You might also search these additional scriptures and make a list of guidelines that can help a person recognize the Lord’s voice:\n1 Kings 19:11–12\n;\nLuke 24:15–32\n;\n3 Nephi 11:3–7\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n8:2–3\n;\n9:7–9\n.\nOther times, you may feel that the heavens are shut and that God does not want to communicate with you. President Russell M. Nelson said, “Does God really\nwant\nto speak to you? Yes!” (“\nRevelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 93–96). As you study President Nelson’s message, what do you find that inspires you to hear and obey the voice of the Lord? What does President Nelson invite you to do, and what blessings does he promise? You can also find invitations and promised blessings about revelation in “\nWalk in God’s light\n” (\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 16–20). Consider choosing one thing you can do to “increase your spiritual capacity to receive revelation.”\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nWhat did it mean to glean a field?\nWhy was it significant that Boaz was one of Naomi’s “next kinsmen”?\nWhy did Naomi instruct Ruth to lay at the feet of Boaz?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nRuth\nI can show love and kindness to people around me.\nAs you share with your children the story of Ruth (you could use “\nRuth and Naomi\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 100–103), invite them to raise their hands every time they hear an act of kindness in the story. They could also share how they feel when others are kind to them, or when they are kind to others. How has the Savior been kind to us? How can we follow His example? (see “\nKindness Begins with Me,\n”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 145).\nRuth and Naomi\nRuth\n;\n1 Samuel 1\nI can have faith in the Lord.\nThe stories of Ruth and Hannah can inspire your children to stay faithful during hard times. Consider helping them create a simple chart with the headings\nTrials\n,\nActions\n,\nBlessings\n. Then you could read together\nRuth 1:3–5, 8, 16\n;\n2:1–3, 8–12\n;\n4:13–17\n;\n1 Samuel 1:1–18\nand write under the headings what they find in these verses. How did Ruth and Hannah show their faith in the Lord? You or your children could then share examples of how the Lord has blessed you during hard times.\n1 Samuel 1:1–18\nHeavenly Father hears and answers my prayers.\nTo learn about Hannah, your children could read\n1 Samuel 1:1–18\nor “\nHannah\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n(104–5) or watch “Hannah’s Faith” (video, Gospel Library). It might be fun to toss a ball to a child and invite them to tell part of the story before passing the ball to someone else. What do we learn about prayer from Hannah’s example?\nHannah\nHannah's Faith\nSamuel Tells Eli the Truth\n, by Robert T. Barrett\n1 Samuel 3:1–10\nI can hear and obey the Lord’s voice.\nPerhaps a simple role-play could help your children learn from Samuel’s experience with revelation. One child could pretend to be Samuel, and another could pretend to be Eli as you read\n1 Samuel 3:1–10\n(see also “\nSamuel the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 106–9, or the video “Samuel and Eli,” Gospel Library). What do we learn from Samuel about how to hear the voice of the Lord? How do we show that we are willing to hear when the Lord speaks to us?\nSamuel the Prophet\nSamuel and Eli\nAsk your children how they would explain to someone how the Lord speaks to them. You could help them look for answers in\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n8:2–3\n;\n9:7–9\n.\nHelp your children learn to recognize the Spirit.\nIt’s not easy to discern between our own feelings and the Holy Ghost. Everyone struggles with this from time to time. Take every opportunity you can to help your children recognize when they are feeling the influence of the Spirit. For example, as you read\n1 Samuel 3:1–10\nand the suggested verses in the Doctrine and Covenants, you could share experiences in which the Lord has taught you in your mind and heart.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nBoy Samuel Called by the Lord\n, by Harry Anderson\nOpen PDF"

Though tall and handsome, he was “little in [his] own sight” and self-conscious about his family heritage (see\n1 Samuel 9:2–3, 21\n;\n15:17\n). On the day he was to be presented before Israel as their king, he didn’t show up; he was so nervous he “hid himself” (\n1 Samuel 10:21–22\n). Looking at Saul, you might not have guessed that he would lead the Israelites to victory over their enemies—or that he would later become prideful and rebel against the Lord.\nDavid was a keeper of sheep. He wasn’t as physically impressive as his seven older brothers. On the day Samuel came to choose a new king for Israel, it didn’t seem worthwhile to include David among the possible candidates, so he was left out in the fields with the sheep. Looking at David, you might not have guessed that he would have the faith and courage to defeat a giant and become Israel’s most successful king.\nBut the Lord sees past our labels, our physical appearance, our insecurities. He looks, instead, “on the heart” (\n1 Samuel 16:7\n). And even when our heart isn’t quite right, if we’re willing, He will give us “another heart” (\n1 Samuel 10:9\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Samuel 8\nJesus Christ is my King.\n1 Samuel 8\ntells of an event that would forever change the destiny of the Israelites. For protection against their enemies, the Israelites wanted what their neighbors had—a king to rule over them. As you read about their request and the Lord’s response, think about who you look to for safety and guidance. Consider what it means to let the Lord “reign over [you]” (\n1 Samuel 8:7\n).\nOver the coming weeks, you will read about a number of kings called to lead Israel. As you learn about them, consider the following questions:\nHow were the Lord’s warnings fulfilled in\n1 Samuel 8:10–18\n?\nHow were the children of Israel affected by their choice to have an earthly king?\nHow is Jesus Christ different from earthly kings? Consider what worldly influences you may need to remove from your life to let Christ be your King.\nSee also “\nRejoice, the Lord Is King!\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 66.\n1 Samuel 9–10\n;\n16:1–13\nGod calls people by prophecy to serve in His kingdom.\nRead about how God chose Israel’s kings in\n1 Samuel 9–10\nand\n16\n(see especially\n9:15–17\n;\n10:1–12\n;\n16:1–13\n). Look for passages that help you understand what it means to “be called of God, by prophecy” in the Lord’s Church today (\nArticles of Faith 1:5\n). You might consider putting yourself in the place of the leader extending the calling (Samuel), the person being called (Saul and David), and the people they are called to serve (the Israelites). What do you learn from their words and actions in these chapters?\nIllustration of Samuel anointing Saul, by P. Mann, © Lifeway Collection/licensed from\ngoodsalt.com\n1 Samuel 13:5–14\n;\n15\n“To obey is better than sacrifice.”\nConsidering how timid Saul seemed in\n1 Samuel 10\n, it’s surprising to read about his “rebellion” and “stubbornness” after he became king (\n1 Samuel 15:23\n). Why do you think this happened? In\n1 Samuel 13:5–14\n, what attitudes and behaviors do you see that led to his downfall?\nIn\n1 Samuel 15\n, you’ll read about a commandment from the Lord that Saul didn’t obey because he thought he had a good reason. To learn from Saul’s poor choices, look at\nverse 22\nand replace the words “sacrifice” and “fat of rams” with things that seem good but are not as important as hearing and obeying the Lord. How have you been blessed as you’ve put the Lord’s will first in your life?\n1 Samuel 16:6–12\n“The Lord looketh on the heart.”\nHave you ever made a decision based on “the outward appearance” of something or someone, only to find out that you were wrong? Maybe you ate something that wasn’t as good as it looked. Or maybe you judged someone unfairly.\nWhen Samuel was looking for a new king of Israel, the Lord taught him a better way. Read about it in\n1 Samuel 16:6–7\n, and consider making a list of ways people judge others “on the outward appearance.” You can find some examples in Elder Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier’s message “\nWe Are His Children\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 114–16). What does it mean to look “on the heart,” as the Lord does? (\n1 Samuel 16:7\n). You can find examples of this, too, in Elder Giraud-Carrier’s message. Maybe you can think of other times when the Savior looked past a person’s outward appearance. (See, for instance,\nMark 12:41–44\n;\nLuke 5:1–11\n;\n19:1–9\n;\nJohn 4:5–30\n;\nMoses 6:31–36\n.) What do you learn from these examples?\nHow can you follow the Savior’s example in the way you see others—and yourself? How might doing so affect your interactions with others? Consider telling someone about the goodness you see in their heart.\nSee also Ulisses Soares, “\nBrothers and Sisters in Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 70–73.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nWhy was it wrong for Saul to perform a burnt offering?\nWhat was the purpose of David’s anointing?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n1 Samuel 8\nJesus Christ is my King.\nAs you read\n1 Samuel 8\nwith your children, help them find reasons Samuel told the Israelites that having a king was a bad idea. Why is it better to have Jesus Christ as our king? Maybe you could make a paper crown together and take turns wearing it and sharing something we can do to show that we want Jesus to be our King. (See also\nJeremiah 23:5\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:59\n.)\n1 Samuel 8:6\n;\n9:15–17\n;\n10:1–24\n;\n16:1–13\nPeople who serve in the Church are called by God.\nThe accounts of God choosing Saul and David to be kings can help your children understand how people are called to serve in the Church today by revelation. To teach them these stories, you could write down events from the stories on strips of paper, and your children could put them in the correct order as you read the scripture passages together (see also “\nYoung David\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 110–11). Then you could talk about times when God blessed you with spiritual power to fulfill an assignment or calling (see\n1 Samuel 10:9–10\n).\nYoung David\nThis might also be a good time to teach your children the\nfifth article of faith\n. Tell them how you received your calling in the Church. How do you know that you were called of God?\nThe Prophet Samuel Anoints David to Be King of Israel in Bethlehem\n, by Balage Balogh\n1 Samuel 16:1–13\nThe Lord looks on the heart.\nAn object lesson could help your children understand the principle in\n1 Samuel 16:7\n.

This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our Eternal King, who was a descendant of David (see Matthew 1:1 ; Luke 1:32–33 ; John 18:33–37 )."

      "plain_text": "“June 15–21. ‘The Battle Is the Lord’s’: 1 Samuel 17–18; 24–26; 2 Samuel 5–7,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“June 15–21. ‘The Battle Is the Lord’s,’”\nCome, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\nDavid and Goliath\n, by Steve Nethercott\nJune 15–21: “The Battle Is the Lord’s”\n1 Samuel 17–18\n;\n24–26\n;\n2 Samuel 5–7\nEver since the tribes of Israel had settled in the promised land, the Philistines had been an ongoing threat to their safety. The Lord had delivered them many times in the past, but now the elders of Israel demanded, “We will have a king … [to] go out before us, and fight our battles” (\n1 Samuel 8:19–20\n). So Saul was anointed king. And yet when the menacing giant Goliath hurled his challenge to the armies of Israel, Saul—like the rest of his army—was “greatly afraid” (\n1 Samuel 17:11\n). On that day, it wasn’t King Saul who saved Israel but a humble shepherd boy named David, who was wearing no armor but was clothed with impenetrable faith in the Lord. This battle proved to Israel, and to anyone who has spiritual battles to fight, that “the Lord saveth not with sword and spear” and that “the battle is the Lord’s” (\n1 Samuel 17:47\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Samuel 17\nWith the help of the Lord, I can overcome any challenge.\nThe story of David and Goliath is one of the best-known stories in the scriptures. Of course, we usually focus on David. But this time, as you study\n1 Samuel 17\n, ponder also the words of other people in this chapter (see the list below). What do you learn about them and their motives? What do you learn about David? How is he different?\nGoliath:\nverses 8–10, 43–44\nEliab:\nverse 28\nSaul:\nverse 33\nDavid:\nverses 26, 32, 34–37, 39, 45–47\nYour story, though not as well-known as David’s, is sure to include Goliath-size challenges to overcome and opportunities to exercise faith in the Lord. What does David’s example teach you about facing the adversity in your story? You might also read President Camille N. Johnson’s message “\nInvite Christ to Author Your Story\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 80–82) with one of your challenges in mind. Look for answers to questions like these: How does the Lord want me to view my challenges? How has He helped me in the past? How can I show that I trust Him to write my story?\nYou may already know that there are some tragic chapters later in David’s story (see, for example,\n2 Samuel 11\n). If you had the opportunity to give David some advice after his battle with Goliath, what would you say? How might this advice apply to your life?\nSee also “The Lord Will Deliver Me” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Lord Will Deliver Me\n1 Samuel 17:26–50\nOne person with faith in Christ can make a difference.\nIn addition to personal challenges, we also face large, complex problems that affect the whole world. When forces of evil are “gathered together … to battle” against the forces of good (\n1 Samuel 17:1\n), we might wonder how our individual efforts could possibly make a difference. What do you find in David’s story that gives you hope? Sister Andrea M. Spannaus taught that the five stones David carried into his battle with Goliath could represent things we need to win our spiritual battles. Read her message “\nFaithful to the End\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 59–61). How can you access these sources of strength in your life?\nSee also “\nLet Us All Press On\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 243.\nTrue Friendship and Self-Respect\n, by Wilson Ong (detail)\n1 Samuel 18\n“Jonathan loved [David] as his own soul.”\nAs you read\n1 Samuel 18\n, consider contrasting Saul and his son Jonathan (who, if not for David, could have assumed he would be the next king). How did Saul and Jonathan react to David’s success? What can you learn from this experience?\nWhat do you find in Jonathan’s attitudes and actions that reminds you of Jesus Christ?\n“Liken the scriptures” (\n1 Nephi 19:23\n).\nThe scriptures provide great opportunities to learn from the motivations and actions of people like David, Jonathan, and Saul. You’ll find that no one in the scriptures is flawless. So as you read, for example, about David’s faithful choices, be open to learning also from his mistakes. Doing so can help us identify potential weaknesses in ourselves and “learn to be more wise than [others] have been” (\nMormon 9:31\n).\n1 Samuel 24–26\nForgiveness is the sure path to peace and healing.\nIn\n1 Samuel 24–26\n, look for lessons about pride, forgiveness, and self-control. You might also consider reading Elder Mark A. Bragg’s message “\nChristlike Poise\n” as part of your study (\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 60–63). How did David, Abigail, and others demonstrate—or fail to demonstrate—Christlike poise in these chapters? What opportunities do you have to show Christlike poise?\nSister Kristen Yee’s message “\nBeauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 36–39) can help you study\n1 Samuel 25\n. How is Abigail like Jesus Christ?\n2 Samuel 5:17–25\nThe Lord can give me direction.\nEven after David defeated Goliath, his problems with the Philistines were not over. As you read\n2 Samuel 5:17–25\n, consider how David’s example can help you in the challenges you face (see also\n1 Samuel 23:2, 10–11\n;\n30:8\n;\n2 Samuel 2:1\n). How are you being blessed by acting on the revelation you receive?\n2 Samuel 7\nWhat is the “house” the Lord promised to David?\nWhen David offered to build a house, meaning a temple, for the Lord (see\n2 Samuel 7:1–3\n), the Lord responded that David’s\nson\nwould build it (see\nverses 12–15\n; see also\n1 Chronicles 17:1–15\n). The Lord also said that He in turn would build David a “house,” meaning a posterity, and that his throne would last forever (see\n2 Samuel 7:11, 16, 25–29\n;\nPsalm 89:3–4, 35–37\n). This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our Eternal King, who was a descendant of David (see\nMatthew 1:1\n;\nLuke 1:32–33\n;\nJohn 18:33–37\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nScripture Helps\nWhat is meant by the title “Lord of Hosts”?\nWhy was Uzzah smitten by God for trying to steady the ark?\nClick to see more.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n1 Samuel 17:20–54\nFaith in Jesus Christ can help me have courage.\nYou may want to use “\nDavid and Goliath\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 112–16, to help your children become familiar with what happened in\n1 Samuel 17:20–54\n. Then you could let them retell the story using the pictures or line drawings in this outline. Ask them what they think the Lord wants them to learn from this story.\nDavid and Goliath\nYou and your children could also make a list of some difficult challenges they might face during their life. Then help them find things David said that can help with these challenges (see\n1 Samuel 17:26, 32, 34–37, 45–47\n). Share how Jesus Christ has helped you during challenges.\nYour children could march like they are David going to fight Goliath while singing a song about being courageous, such as “\nI Will Be Valiant\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 162).\n1 Samuel 18:1–4\nGood friends can be a blessing from God.\nHow can you help your children learn from Jonathan and David’s friendship? One way would be to give each child two paper hearts, one to represent David and the other to represent Jonathan. Then read together a few phrases from\n1 Samuel 18:1–4\nthat emphasize the love these two friends felt for each other. Your children could then write or draw on their paper hearts how they can show love to a friend.\n2 Samuel 5:19, 23\nIf I need guidance, I can ask Heavenly Father.\nIn these chapters, David became the king of Israel. It might be fun for your children to pretend to be a king or queen. What laws would they make? Where would they go for help?

Humble, courageous, and wise, they each found favor with the Lord—at least at first. Sadly, each king also gave in to human weaknesses and temptation. They put their own desires before the Lord’s. And as we’ve seen over and over in the scriptures—and in our own lives—that led to tragedy.\nBut something important happened during the reign of Solomon that provided some hope for stability in the lives of the covenant people. Solomon built a temple. It was to be a more permanent house of the Lord than the tabernacle had been. And it would represent a more permanent presence of the Lord among His people. Solomon knew that the people would continue to face weakness and trials of various kinds. In dedicating the new holy house, Solomon pleaded with the Lord, “If they … return unto thee with all their heart, … then hear thou their prayer” (\n1 Kings 8:47–48\n). That’s part of what temple covenants do for us—they create a connection to God. They secure for us the promise that through our repentance and His mercy, He can “dwell among [us]” and never forsake us (\n1 Kings 6:13\n).\nFor an overview of the book of 1 Kings, see “\nKings, books of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Samuel 11\n;\n12:1–14\nThe Lord can help me make good choices when I am tempted to sin.\nSometimes we look at people who seem strong in their faith, and we assume that they are unaffected by temptation.

The kingdom had divided, with ten tribes forming the Northern Kingdom of Israel and two tribes forming the Southern Kingdom of Judah. But worse than their separation from each other was both kingdoms’ separation from their covenants. Wicked kings led the people away from the Lord, and many people wavered in their faith.\nIn this setting, the Lord called Elijah to be a prophet. His life shows that a person can have great faith in the Lord even in bad circumstances. Sometimes the Lord responds to such faith with impressive, public miracles, like fire falling from heaven. But He also works quiet, private miracles, like feeding a faithful widow and her son. And most often the Lord’s miracles are so individual that they are known only to one person—for example, when the Lord reveals Himself to you through “a still small voice” (\n1 Kings 19:12\n).\nFor more about Elijah, see “\nElijah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Kings 12:1–20\nChristlike leaders serve the people they lead.\nHow would you describe the mistake King Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, made in\n1 Kings 12:1–14\n?

        "Miracles show us God’s power. They can help us overcome the difficulties of mortality—like a barren land that needs pure water (see 2 Kings 2:19–22 ) or a lost ax that needs to be recovered (see 2 Kings 6:4–7 ). But most importantly, miracles can turn us to the Lord. As you read 2 Kings 2–6 , consider listing the miracles you find, and ponder the spiritual lessons you learn from each one.",
        "You might also compare the miracles Elisha performed with miracles that Jesus Christ performed (see 2 Kings 4:8–37 and Luke 7:11–16 ; 2 Kings 4:42–44 and John 6:1–13 ; 2 Kings 5:1–15 and Luke 17:11–19 ). What do these miracles teach you about the Savior and His prophets?",
        "See also 2 Nephi 26:12–13 ; 27:23 ; Moroni 7:35–37 ; the section “ Seek and expect miracles ” in Russell M. Nelson, “ The Power of Spiritual Momentum ,” Liahona , May 2022, 99–100.",
        "The Lord inspired Elisha to prophesy of things to come—usually, things that seemed unlikely to occur. As you read 2 Kings 4:8–17 ; 7:1–16 , think about how you respond to the word of the Lord through His prophets today. What teachings, prophecies, or promises have you heard from living prophets? What are you doing to act in faith on their words?",

        "As you read 2 Kings 5 , consider comparing Naaman’s leprosy with a spiritual challenge you are facing.",
        "Is there someone like the “little maid” in your life, encouraging you to seek guidance about your challenge from the Lord’s prophets? (see verses 2–3, 13 ).",
        "What is the Lord inviting you to do that might seem too simple—like “wash, and be clean”? ( verse 13 ). What might be keeping you from accepting His simple invitations?",
        "How can you show humility as Naaman did?",
        "Note how Naaman’s experience affected his faith in the God of Israel (see verse 15 ). What can you learn from this?",
        "See also Luke 4:27 ; 1 Peter 5:5–7 ; Alma 37:3–7 ; Ether 12:27 ; L. Whitney Clayton, “ Whatsoever He Saith unto You, Do It ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2017, 97–99; “Naaman and Elisha” (video), Gospel Library.",
        "As you try to follow Christ, have you ever felt like Elisha’s young servant—outnumbered and fearful? Imagine you were in his place as you read 2 Kings 6:8–23 . How does this story change the way you think and feel about your trials, your responsibilities, or your efforts to live the gospel?",
        "As you ponder, consider President Henry B. Eyring’s words: “Like that servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those you can see opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal eyes. The Lord will bear you up and will at times do it by calling others to stand with you” (“ O Ye That Embark ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2008, 58).",
        "Consider making a list of “they that be with [you]” ( verse 16 )—people God has placed in your life to support you. You might ask Him to help you identify them by opening your spiritual eyes. He has probably also placed you in others’ lives to help them. How can you draw strength and support from each other?",
        "When have you felt the support that the Lord describes in Doctrine and Covenants 84:88 ?",
        "You might also study Sister Michelle D. Craig’s message “ Eyes to See ” ( Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2020, 15–17). Ask yourself, “What does God want me to see?”",
        "Referring to the story in 2 Kings 6:8–23 , Elder Ronald A. Rasband said: “We may or may not have chariots of fire sent to dispel our fears and conquer our demons, but the lesson is clear. The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do. Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you. … In this Church we may be few in number by the way the world counts influence, but when we open our spiritual eyes, ‘they that be with us are more than they that be with them’ [ 2 Kings 6:16 ]” (“ Be Not Troubled ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 18, 19). How would you use these words to help someone who feels anxious or afraid?",

Our record of the prophet Elisha, however, doesn’t include much of his teaching or testifying. What the record does include is the miracles Elisha performed, including raising a child from the dead (see\n2 Kings 4:18–37\n), feeding a multitude with just a little food (see\n2 Kings 4:42–44\n), and healing a leper (see\n2 Kings 5:1–14\n). So while we don’t have Elisha’s words about Christ, we do have Elisha’s ministry and miracles, which do testify of Christ. They are powerful manifestations of the Lord’s life-giving, nourishing, and healing power. Miracles happen more often in our lives than we sometimes realize. To see them, we need to seek the faith Elisha had when he prayed on behalf of his fearful young servant: “Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see” (\n2 Kings 6:17\n).\nFor more information about 2 Kings, see “\nKings, books of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Kings 2–6\nGod can work miracles in my life.\nMiracles show us God’s power. They can help us overcome the difficulties of mortality—like a barren land that needs pure water (see\n2 Kings 2:19–22\n) or a lost ax that needs to be recovered (see\n2 Kings 6:4–7\n). But most importantly, miracles can turn us to the Lord. As you read\n2 Kings 2–6\n, consider listing the miracles you find, and ponder the spiritual lessons you learn from each one.\nYou might also compare the miracles Elisha performed with miracles that Jesus Christ performed (see\n2 Kings 4:8–37\nand\nLuke 7:11–16\n;\n2 Kings 4:42–44\nand\nJohn 6:1–13\n;\n2 Kings 5:1–15\nand\nLuke 17:11–19\n).

As you read\n2 Kings 4:8–17\n;\n7:1–16\n, think about how you respond to the word of the Lord through His prophets today. What teachings, prophecies, or promises have you heard from living prophets?

(see\nverses 2–3, 13\n).\nWhat is the Lord inviting you to do that might seem too simple—like “wash, and be clean”? (\nverse 13\n).

(See also “\nElisha and the Lord’s Army\n,” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 138–39, or the picture at the end of this outline.) When you get to the words “open his eyes” (\nverse 17\n), ask the children to open their eyes. Talk about what the servant saw.

There the Lord declared that He wanted to turn this group of recently liberated slaves into a mighty people. “Ye shall be unto me,” He said, “a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation” (\nExodus 19:6\n). He promised that they would flourish and prosper, even when surrounded by larger, more powerful enemies.\nAll this would happen not because the Israelites were numerous or strong or skillful. It would happen, the Lord explained, if they would “obey [His] voice indeed, and keep [His] covenant” (\nExodus 19:5\n). God’s power, not their own, would make them mighty.\nYet the Israelites didn’t always obey God’s voice, and over time they stopped keeping His covenant. Many worshipped other gods and adopted the practices of the cultures around them. They rejected the very thing that made them a distinct nation—their covenant relationship with the Lord. Without God’s power protecting them, there was nothing to stop their enemies.\nThe Scattering\nSeveral times between about 735 and 720 BC, the Assyrians invaded the Northern Kingdom of Israel, home to ten of the twelve tribes, and took thousands of the Israelites captive into various parts of the Assyrian Empire.\nThese Israelites became known as “the lost tribes,” in part because they were removed from their homeland and scattered among other nations.

Some the Lord led away to other lands.\nOthers left Israel to escape capture\nor for political or economic reasons.\nWe call all these events the scattering of Israel. And it’s important to know about the scattering for several reasons.

Eventually, the Assyrian Empire conquered and scattered the ten tribes of Israel. Meanwhile, the Southern Kingdom of Judah wasn’t doing much better: idolatry was also widespread there.\nAmid all this spiritual decay, the scriptures mention two kings of Judah who, for a time, turned their people back to the Lord. One was Hezekiah. During his reign, the Assyrians conquered much of Judah. But Hezekiah and his people showed faith in the Lord, who saved Jerusalem in a miraculous way. Later, after another period of apostasy, Josiah became king. Inspired in part by a rediscovery of the book of the law of Moses, Josiah brought reforms that revived the religious life of his people.\nLike Israel and Judah, we all make both good and bad choices. When we sense that our lives need some reforms, we can take encouragement from these two bright spots in the dark years of Judah’s history. Perhaps the examples of Hezekiah and Josiah can inspire us to “trust in the Lord our God” (\n2 Kings 18:22\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Kings 18–19\nI can stay true to the Lord when my faith is challenged.\nMost of us have experiences that challenge our faith.

Armies from three powerful enemy nations were all advancing at once, prepared for battle. In this desperate moment of need, Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, turned to the King of heaven and earth. Jehoshaphat gathered his people at the temple and prayed. He acknowledged their human weakness and pleaded for deliverance. In response, the Lord promised His protection: “Fear not, nor be dismayed” (\n2 Chronicles 20:17\n).\nWe might not have an invading army at our doorstep threatening to destroy us, but sometimes we do feel surrounded by adversity and evil. Our path to deliverance is the same one Jehoshaphat sought, and our prayer can be like his too: “O our God, … we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee” (\n2 Chronicles 20:12\n).\nIn\n2 Chronicles 14–30\n, you will read about Jehoshaphat and other kings in Judah.

Why do we trust Him to keep us safe spiritually?\nYou could help your children discover how King Asa and King Jehoshaphat responded to challenges by trusting in the Lord (see\n2 Chronicles 14:11\n;\n20:3–5, 12\n). Share with each other ways you can show the Lord that you trust Him.\n2 Chronicles 20:1–29\nGod will hear and answer my prayers.\nThis week’s activity page can help your children understand the story of Jehoshaphat’s prayer and the Lord’s answer. You and your children could share times when God heard and answered your prayers. Consider including times when the answers came in ways or at times that you didn’t expect. A song about prayer, such as “\nI Pray in Faith\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 14), could help build your children’s faith.\n2 Chronicles 26:3–23\nI can be humble.\nTo learn about the dangers of pride, your children could build a tower with blocks or small cups. As they place each block or cup on the tower, help them identify one of Uzziah’s accomplishments from\n2 Chronicles 26:3–15\n. After they finish the tower, discuss with your children how Uzziah could keep it tall and strong. What could make it fall? Then, as you read\nverse 16\n, you could talk about what it means to have our hearts “lifted up to [our] destruction.” Share with your children what happened to Uzziah in\nverses 16–23\n. Let them knock down their tower. Talk about what we can do to stay humble.\nKing Hezekiah and the People Thank God\n, © Lifeway Collection/licensed from goodsalt.com\n2 Chronicles 30\nI can be a peacemaker.\nThe picture above shows when Hezekiah invited Judah’s neighbors from the Kingdom of Israel to celebrate Passover with them. You could look at this image with your children and read\n2 Chronicles 30:18–19\n, which explains that some of the guests had not washed themselves according to the law of Moses. What did Hezekiah do? How would this have made the guests feel? Help your children think of how they can be like Hezekiah in the way they treat others.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nUzziah’s Pride and Punishment\n, by A. M.

They had lost Jerusalem and the temple, and many had forgotten their commitment to God’s law. But God had not forgotten them. In fact, He had declared through His prophet, “I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return” (\nJeremiah 29:10\n). True to this prophecy, the Lord made a way for His people to return—both to Jerusalem and, more importantly, to their covenants. And He raised up servants who accomplished “a great work” (\nNehemiah 6:3\n): A governor named Zerubbabel oversaw the rebuilding of the house of the Lord. Ezra, a priest and scribe, helped the people turn their hearts back to the Lord’s law. And Nehemiah led the rebuilding of the protective walls around Jerusalem. They met opposition, but they also got help from unexpected sources. Their experiences can inform and inspire ours because we too are doing a great work. And like theirs, our work has much to do with the house of the Lord, the law of the Lord, and the spiritual protection we find in Him.\nFor an overview of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, see “\nEzra\n” and “\nNehemiah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEzra 1\nThe Lord inspires people to accomplish His purposes.\nAfter Persia conquered Babylonia, the Lord inspired the Persian king, Cyrus, to send a group of Jews to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. As you read\nEzra 1\n, note what Cyrus did to support the Jews in this important work. How do you see the Lord working through men and women around you, including people who are not members of His Church? What does this suggest to you about the Lord and His work?\nSee also\nIsaiah 44:24–28\n.\nEzra 3:8–13\n;\n6:16–22\nThe house of the Lord is a place of joy.\nWhen the Babylonians invaded Jerusalem, they plundered the temple and burned it to the ground (see\n2 Kings 25:1–10\n;\n2 Chronicles 36:17–19\n). How do you think you might have felt if you had been one of the Jews who witnessed this? (see\nPsalm 137\n). Notice how the Jews felt, decades later, when they were allowed to return and rebuild the temple (see\nEzra 3:8–13\n;\n6:16–22\n). That might prompt you to ponder your own feelings about the Lord and His house. Why is the building of a temple a reason to celebrate?\nThe temple of Zerubbabel; illustration by Sam Lawlor\nEzra 4–7\n;\nNehemiah 2\n;\n4\n;\n6\nGod has an important work for me to do.\nThe Lord’s work rarely goes unopposed.

Here’s a simple approach that can help you learn from these stories and consider how you can do the Lord’s work despite opposition:\nGod’s work for Zerubbabel (\nEzra 4:3\n):\nGod’s work for Nehemiah (\nNehemiah 2:17–18\n):\nGod’s work for me:\nOpposition Zerubbabel faced (\nEzra 4:4–24\n):\nOpposition Nehemiah faced (\nNehemiah 2:19\n;\n4:1–3, 7–8\n;\n6:1–13\n):\nOpposition I face:\nHow Zerubbabel responded (\nEzra 5:1–2\n):\nHow Nehemiah responded (\nNehemiah 2:20\n;\n4:6, 9\n;\n6:3–15\n):\nHow I can respond:\nFor help comparing Nehemiah’s experience to your life, you might study President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “\nWe Are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2009, 59–62), especially\nthe last two sections\n. As you think about the work God has given you, you might study the “\nYoung Women Theme\n” or the “\nAaronic Priesthood Quorum Theme\n” (Gospel Library). Or you could look in a hymn like “\nAs Sisters in Zion\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 309) or “\nYe Elders of Israel\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 319).\nWhat do you think it means to have “a mind to work” in the service of the Savior? (\nNehemiah 4:6\n). What might it mean to have “the good hand of … God upon [you]” as you do His work? (\nNehemiah 2:8\n; see also\nNehemiah 2:18\n;\nEzra 7:6, 9, 27–28\n). How have you seen His hand in your efforts to serve Him?\nNehemiah 8\nI am blessed when I study the scriptures.\nFor generations in captivity, the Jews had limited access to “the book of the law of Moses” (\nNehemiah 8:1\n). In\nNehemiah 8\n, Ezra read the law to the people. What do you find in this chapter that shows how Ezra and his people felt about God and His word? (see especially\nverses 1–12\n). What in your life shows how you feel about God and His word?\nSee also\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson\n(2014),\n115–24\n.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nEzra 3:8–13\n;\n6:16–22\nThe house of the Lord is a place of joy.\nTo teach your children about the joy the Jews felt when their temple was rebuilt, you could show them a picture like the one below. Talk about why these people might be happy to be at the house of the Lord. You could also tell your children why the temple is a place of joy for you. How has the temple helped you feel closer to Heavenly Father and the Savior?\nAs you read\nEzra 3:10–13\nwith your children, help them find words that show how the Jews felt when the temple was being rebuilt. When you get to the end of\nverse 13\n, maybe you could shout for joy together. Help your children think of reasons to be joyful that the Lord has given us temples. How can we show that joy?\nConsider singing a song about the temple with your children, such as the second verse of “Welcome Home” (Gospel Library). After each line, you could pause to ask a child to share something he or she loves about the temple. You might also look at\npictures of temples\nwhile you sing.\nNehemiah 2:17–20\n;\n6:1–9\nThe Lord will help me do His “great work.”\nShare with your children the story of Nehemiah (see\nNehemiah 2:17–20\n;\n6:1–9\n; or “\nNehemiah\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 173–74). As you read\nNehemiah 2:20\n, you and your children could “arise” and pretend to help build the walls of Jerusalem. Or your children might enjoy building a wall with blocks or other objects. As they do, you could help them think of important things Heavenly Father wants us to do.\nNehemiah\nAs you read\nNehemiah 6:9\n, invite your children to raise their hands when they hear you say “strengthen my hands.” Tell the children about a time when you felt God strengthen your hands to do His work.\nNehemiah 8:1–12\nThe scriptures are a blessing.\nRead aloud some phrases from\nNehemiah 8:2–3, 5–6, 8–9, 12\nthat describe what the people did when they heard Ezra read the scriptures. As you read, your children could act out these phrases. Then you could share with each other how you feel when you read or hear the scriptures.\nAs you read together\nNehemiah 8:8\n, you could ask your children what helps them understand the scriptures. Show them how to use scripture study aids like the\nGuide to the Scriptures\nand\nTopics and Questions\n(Gospel Library). Invite your children to share something they have learned about the Savior from the scriptures.\nLook for eternal truth in the scriptures.\n“The scriptures … are filled with gospel truths, but sometimes it takes conscious effort to find them. As you are learning together from the scriptures, stop and ask those you teach what gospel truths they notice. Help them see how these truths relate to Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation. Sometimes eternal truths are stated in the scriptures, and sometimes they are illustrated in the stories and lives of the people we read about. It can also be helpful to explore together the historical background of the verses you are reading, as well as the meaning of the verses and how they apply to us today” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n22\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nEzra at the Water Gate\n, © Providence Collection/licensed from goodsalt.com\nOpen PDF"

What are the chances that Esther’s cousin Mordecai would happen to overhear a plot to assassinate the king? Were these coincidences, or were they part of a divine plan? Elder Ronald A. Rasband noted: “What may appear to be a random chance is, in fact, overseen by a loving Father in Heaven. … The Lord is in the small details of our lives” (“\nBy Divine Design\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 56). We might not always recognize the Lord’s influence in these “small details.” But we learn from Esther’s experience that He can guide our path and prepare us “for such a time” (\nEsther 4:14\n) when we can be instruments in His hands to fulfill His purposes.\nFor an overview of the book of Esther, see “\nEsther, book of\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEsther\nThe Lord puts me in situations where I can bless others.\nPresident Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught that each of us “stands at a unique place and has an important task that only [we] can perform. … The Lord gave you your responsibilities for a reason. There may be people and hearts only you can reach and touch. Perhaps no one else could do it in quite the same way” (“\nLift Where You Stand\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2008, 56).\nAs you read the story of Esther, ponder how this statement applies to her. Look for ways the Lord made it possible for her to save the Jews (see, for example,\nEsther 2:21–23\n;\n3:10–14\n;\n4:14–16\n). Then ponder how He has given you opportunities to bless others. What are some circumstances or relationships that He has guided you to “for such a time as this”? (\nEsther 4:14\n). If you have a patriarchal blessing, consider reading it to learn more about the work the Lord has for you to do. What can you do to accomplish this work?\nSee also “For Such a Time as This” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nFor Such a Time as This\nWe learn more by doing than by listening.\nElder David A. Bednar counseled teachers: “Our intent ought not to be ‘What do I tell them?’ Instead, the questions to ask ourselves are ‘What can I invite them to do? What inspired questions can I ask that, if they are willing to respond, will begin to invite the Holy Ghost into their lives?’” (in\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n25\n). If you are teaching your family or a class about Esther, what could you ask them to do that will help them learn?\n“When Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not … then was Haman full of wrath” (\nEsther 3:5\n).\nEsther 3\n;\n5:9–14\n;\n7\nPride and anger can lead to downfall.\nIn the book of Esther, we learn from the faithfulness of Esther and Mordecai, but we also learn from the pride and anger of Haman. As you read\nEsther 3\n;\n5:9–14\n, note Haman’s feelings, words, and actions. What do they reveal about him and his motivations? What consequences did he face? (see\nEsther 7\n). Reading about Haman may prompt you to evaluate what motivates your feelings and actions. Are you inspired to make any changes? How can you turn to Heavenly Father for help?\nSee also\nProverbs 16:32\n;\nAlma 5:28\n.\nEsther 3–4\n;\n5:2–3\n;\n8:11–12\nFasting shows that I trust and rely on the Lord.\nNotice why Esther and the rest of the Jews decided to fast (see\nEsther 3:13\n;\n4:1–3, 10–17\n). How did fasting bless them? (see\nEsther 5:2–3\n;\n8:11–12\n). Why does the Lord ask us to fast? (see Topics and Questions, “\nFasting and Fast Offerings\n,” Gospel Library). Consider how you can make fasting a greater blessing in your life.\nSee also\nIsaiah 58:6–12\n; “Fasting: Young Single Adult Ward, Amanda” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nFasting: Young Single Adult Ward, Amanda\nEsther 3:1–11\n;\n4:10–17\n;\n5:1–4\n;\n9:17–19\nDoing the right thing often requires great courage.\nWhen Mordecai and Esther stood up for their beliefs and their people, they put their lives at risk. Our choices might have less severe consequences, but doing the right thing can still require courage. What do you learn from\nEsther 3:1–4\n;\n4:10–17\nabout having courage to do the right thing? Note the different consequences Mordecai and Esther experienced after showing courage (see\nEsther 3:5–11\n;\n5:1–4\n). What did Esther and Mordecai need to know about God to make the choices they made?\nThink of situations where you need courage to stand up for what’s right. What do you learn from Esther and Mordecai that can help you find courage in the Lord?\nEsther’s courage led to “a day of gladness” (see\nEsther 9:17–19\n). How has Christlike courage given you “a day of gladness”?\nSee also “Courage,” “Dare to Stand Alone” (videos), Gospel Library; “\nTrue to the Faith\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 254.\nCourage\nDare to Stand Alone\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nEsther 2:5–7\nI can serve my family.\nYou might feel inspired to use\nEsther 2:7\nto teach your children about helping family members in need, as Mordecai did for Esther. You could read the verse together or summarize it in your own words. Then you and your children could think of family members who might need your help. Make a plan to help them.\nEsther 3:1–11\n;\n4:10–17\nThe Lord can help me be brave.\nThe examples of Esther and Mordecai can help your children understand that bravery means doing what is right even when you are afraid. Consider writing the phrases\nMordecai was brave when he …\nand\nEsther was brave when she …\n. As you learn the story of Esther together, your children could suggest ways to finish the sentences. You could read\nEsther 3:1–11\n;\n4:10–17\nor “\nQueen Esther\n” (in\nOld Testament Stories\n, 166–70) or look at the pictures in this outline. Then write\nI will be brave by …\n, and invite your children to list things Heavenly Father wants them to do that require courage. A song about courage, such as “\nDare to Do Right\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 158), could help.\nQueen Esther\nYou could also learn about times when Jesus Christ was brave—for example, when He suffered for our sins in Gethsemane and on the cross (see\nMatthew 26:36–39\n;\n27:33–35\n). Ask your children to share a time when they were brave, and share your own experiences as well.\nEsther 4:1–3, 10–17\nFasting brings the Lord’s blessings.\nReading\nEsther 4:1–3, 10–17\ncould help you teach your children about fasting. Why did Esther and the Jews fast? Tell your children why you fast. You could also ask them how they would explain fasting to a friend who has never done it before. How could we help our friends understand the blessings that come from fasting?\nEncourage your children to think of something they might need the Lord’s help with. Suggest they make that part of their fast during the next fast Sunday.\nBecause Esther was brave, she was able to save the Lord’s people.\nEsther 4:14\nI can be an instrument in God’s hands.\nHelp your children understand that when Esther was afraid, Mordecai encouraged her by explaining that the Lord had helped her become the queen “for such a time as this” (\nEsther 4:14\n). What did Mordecai mean by this? Talk with each other about how Esther was an instrument for the Lord. How can we be instruments for the Lord?\nHow could you help your children understand what an instrument is? Maybe you could invite someone to play a song on a musical instrument or show a picture of someone using a tool. You could then talk about what it means to be an instrument in God’s hands.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nQueen Esther\n, by Minerva Teichert, © William and Betty Stokes\nOpen PDF"

        "First, it might help you to know that Hebrew poetry in the Old Testament isn’t based on rhyme, like some other kinds of poetry. And although rhythm, wordplay, and repetition of sounds are common features of ancient Hebrew poetry, these things are typically lost in translation. One feature you will notice, however, is the repetition of thoughts or ideas, sometimes called “parallelism.” Here’s a simple example from Isaiah:",
        "Psalm 29 has many parallel lines—for example:",
        "And here’s an instance where knowing that the second line is parallel to the first makes the passage easier to understand:",
        "In these examples, the poet repeated an idea with slight differences. This technique can emphasize the repeated idea and use the differences to more fully describe or develop it.",
        "In other cases, the two parallel sentences use similar language to convey contrasting ideas, as in this example:",
        "This kind of parallelism didn’t happen by accident. The writers did it intentionally. It helped them express spiritual feelings or truths with both power and beauty. So when you notice parallelism in Old Testament writing, ask yourself how it helps you understand the writer’s message. For example, what might Isaiah have been trying to say by relating “strength” with “beautiful garments” and “Zion” with “Jerusalem”? ( Isaiah 52:1 ). What can we infer about the phrase “a soft answer” if we know that “grievous words” is its opposite? ( Proverbs 15:1 ).",
        "Some people compare reading poetry to meeting a new person. Reading Old Testament poetry, then, might be like meeting someone from a distant country and foreign culture who speaks a different language from us—and who happens to be over two thousand years old. This person will probably say things we don’t understand at first, but that doesn’t mean they have nothing valuable to say. We just need to spend time with them, trying to see things from their point of view. We might find that in our hearts, we actually understand each other quite well. And if we show patience and compassion, our new acquaintance can eventually become a dear friend.",
        "So when you read a passage from Isaiah, for example, consider it your first introduction to a new acquaintance. Ask yourself, “What’s my general impression?” How does the passage make you feel—even if you don’t understand every word? Then read it again, several times if possible. Consider reading it out loud; some people find added meaning that way. Notice specific words Isaiah chose, especially words that paint a picture in your mind. How do those pictures make you feel? What do they suggest about Isaiah’s feelings? The more you study the words of these Old Testament writers, the more you will find that they deliberately chose their words and techniques to express a deep spiritual message.",
        "Poems can be wonderful friends because they help us understand our feelings and experiences. Old Testament poems are especially precious because they help us understand our most important feelings and experiences—the ones connected to our relationship with God.",
        "As you study the poetry in the Old Testament, remember that scripture study is most valuable when it leads us to Jesus Christ. Look for symbols, imagery, and truths that build your faith in Him. Listen for inspiration from the Holy Ghost as you study.",
        "One category of Old Testament poetry is what scholars call “wisdom literature.” Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes fall into this category. While psalms express feelings of praise, mourning, and worship, wisdom literature focuses on timeless advice or deep, philosophical questions. The book of Job, for example, explores the justice of God and the reasons behind human suffering. Proverbs offer counsel on how to live well, including wise sayings collected and passed down from earlier generations. And Ecclesiastes calls into question the purpose of life itself—when everything seems fleeting and random, where do we find true meaning? You might think of wisdom literature as thoughtful conversations with inspired mentors who want to share observations about God and the world He created—and maybe help you understand these things a little better than before."

Noah built an ark, Moses delivered Israel, Hannah prayed to have a son, and so on. Beginning with Job, we find a different writing style. In these books, Old Testament writers turned to poetic language to express deep feelings or monumental prophecies in a memorable way.\nWe have already seen a few examples of poetry sprinkled throughout the historical books of the Old Testament. From the book of Job forward, we will see a lot more of it. The books of Job, Psalms, and Proverbs are almost entirely poetry, as are parts of prophetic books like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos. Because reading poetry is different from reading a story, understanding it often requires a different approach. Here are some thoughts that could help you find more meaning in Old Testament poetry.\nGetting to Know Hebrew Poetry\nFirst, it might help you to know that Hebrew poetry in the Old Testament isn’t based on rhyme, like some other kinds of poetry. And although rhythm, wordplay, and repetition of sounds are common features of ancient Hebrew poetry, these things are typically lost in translation. One feature you will notice, however, is the repetition of thoughts or ideas, sometimes called “parallelism.” Here’s a simple example from Isaiah:\nPut on thy strength, O Zion;\nput on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem. (\nIsaiah 52:1\n)\nPsalm 29\nhas many parallel lines—for example:\nThe voice of the Lord is powerful;\nthe voice of the Lord is full of majesty. (\nPsalm 29:4\n)\nAnd here’s an instance where knowing that the second line is parallel to the first makes the passage easier to understand:\nI also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,\nand want of bread in all your places. (\nAmos 4:6\n)\nIn these examples, the poet repeated an idea with slight differences. This technique can emphasize the repeated idea and use the differences to more fully describe or develop it.\nIn other cases, the two parallel sentences use similar language to convey contrasting ideas, as in this example:\nA soft answer turneth away wrath:\nbut grievous words stir up anger. (\nProverbs 15:1\n)\nThis kind of parallelism didn’t happen by accident. The writers did it intentionally. It helped them express spiritual feelings or truths with both power and beauty. So when you notice parallelism in Old Testament writing, ask yourself how it helps you understand the writer’s message. For example, what might Isaiah have been trying to say by relating “strength” with “beautiful garments” and “Zion” with “Jerusalem”? (\nIsaiah 52:1\n). What can we infer about the phrase “a soft answer” if we know that “grievous words” is its opposite? (\nProverbs 15:1\n).\nHe Restoreth My Soul\n, by Walter Rane\nHebrew Poetry as a New Friend\nSome people compare reading poetry to meeting a new person. Reading Old Testament poetry, then, might be like meeting someone from a distant country and foreign culture who speaks a different language from us—and who happens to be over two thousand years old. This person will probably say things we don’t understand at first, but that doesn’t mean they have nothing valuable to say. We just need to spend time with them, trying to see things from their point of view. We might find that in our hearts, we actually understand each other quite well.

Why would God, who is just, allow that? The book of Job explores questions like these. Job was one of those good people to whom a lot of bad things happened. Because of Job’s trials, his friends wondered if he really was good after all. Job asserted his own righteousness and wondered if God really is just after all. But despite his suffering and wondering, Job maintained his integrity and faith in Jesus Christ. In the book of Job, faith is questioned and tested but never completely abandoned. That doesn’t mean all the questions are answered. But the book of Job teaches that until they are answered, questions can coexist with faith.

        "As you read the Psalms, you might notice how often the writers express fear, sorrow, or anxiety. Such feelings are normal, even for people of faith. But what makes the Psalms inspiring is that they also offer inspiring solutions, including complete trust in the Lord. As you read Psalms 1 ; 23 ; 26–28 ; 46 , write down:",
        "Also watch for the vivid imagery and symbols that the Psalms use to teach about the Savior. For example, in Psalm 23 , what do phrases like “lie down in green pastures” or “still waters” ( verse 2 ) bring to mind? What could the comforting “rod” and “staff” ( verse 4 ) symbolize? What might it mean for our “cup” ( verse 5 ) to run over?",
        "Several of the psalms point to the mortal life of Jesus Christ. Christians in New Testament times saw these connections too. Consider reading the following scripture references. Look for connections between the words in these psalms and the life of the Savior:",
        "What do you learn from studying these connections? What scriptural prophecies and promises haven’t been fulfilled yet? What do you find in these promises that gives you hope for the future?",
        "Reading Psalms 8 ; 19 ; 33 might inspire you to consider the Lord’s many wonderful creations. Pay attention to your feelings as you do. You might also want to sing or ponder the words of a song related to these psalms, such as “ How Great Thou Art ” ( Hymns , 86). How do the Lord’s creations “declare the glory of God” to you? ( Psalm 19:1 ).",
        "Here are some other hymns inspired by the Psalms:",
        "In the Psalms, words like testimony , statutes , commandment , and judgments can refer to the word of the Lord. Keep that in mind as you read Psalm 19:7–11 . What do these verses suggest to you about the word of the Lord? What does Psalm 29 teach you about His voice? In your experience, how has the word or voice of the Lord matched these descriptions?",

Image courtesy of havenlight.com\nAugust 17–23: “The Lord Is My Shepherd”\nPsalms 1–2\n;\n8\n;\n19–33\n;\n40\n;\n46\nWe don’t know for certain who wrote the Psalms. Some are attributed to King David, but for most of them, the writers remain anonymous. Yet after reading the Psalms, we feel as if we know the hearts of the psalmists, even if we don’t know their names. We do know that the Psalms were an important part of worship among the Israelites, and we know that the Savior quoted them often. In the Psalms, we get a window into the soul of God’s ancient people. We see how they felt about God, what they worried about, and how they found peace. As believers today, all over the world, we still use these words in our worship of God. It’s almost like the writers of the Psalms had a window into\nour\nsouls, because they expressed how we feel about God, what we worry about, and how we find peace.\nFor an overview of the book of Psalms, see “\nPsalms\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nPsalms 1\n;\n23\n;\n26–28\n;\n46\n“I have trusted … in the Lord.”\nAs you read the Psalms, you might notice how often the writers express fear, sorrow, or anxiety. Such feelings are normal, even for people of faith. But what makes the Psalms inspiring is that they also offer inspiring solutions, including complete trust in the Lord. As you read\nPsalms 1\n;\n23\n;\n26–28\n;\n46\n, write down:\nInvitations to trust the Lord.\nWords that describe Him.\nWords that describe the peace, strength, and other blessings He provides.\nWords that describe people who trust Him.\nAlso watch for the vivid imagery and symbols that the Psalms use to teach about the Savior. For example, in\nPsalm 23\n, what do phrases like “lie down in green pastures” or “still waters” (\nverse 2\n) bring to mind? What could the comforting “rod” and “staff” (\nverse 4\n) symbolize? What might it mean for our “cup” (\nverse 5\n) to run over?\nPsalms 2\n;\n22\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nSeveral of the psalms point to the mortal life of Jesus Christ. Christians in New Testament times saw these connections too. Consider reading the following scripture references. Look for connections between the words in these psalms and the life of the Savior:\nPsalm 2:1–3\nand\nActs 4:24–28\nPsalm 2:7\nand\nActs 13:30–33\nPsalm 22:1\nand\nMatthew 27:45–46\nPsalm 22:7–8\nand\nMatthew 27:39–43\nPsalm 22:16\nand\nLuke 23:32–33\nPsalm 22:18\nand\nMatthew 27:35\nPsalm 31:5\nand\nLuke 23:46\nWhat do you learn from studying these connections? What scriptural prophecies and promises haven’t been fulfilled yet? What do you find in these promises that gives you hope for the future?\nPsalms 8\n;\n19\n;\n33\n“The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.”\nReading\nPsalms 8\n;\n19\n;\n33\nmight inspire you to consider the Lord’s many wonderful creations. Pay attention to your feelings as you do. You might also want to sing or ponder the words of a song related to these psalms, such as “\nHow Great Thou Art\n” (\nHymns\n, 86). How do the Lord’s creations “declare the glory of God” to you? (\nPsalm 19:1\n).\nHere are some other hymns inspired by the Psalms:\nPsalm 23\n:\n“\nThe Lord Is My Shepherd\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 108)\nPsalms 23:6\n;\n150\n:\n“\nPraise to the Lord, the Almighty\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 72)\nPsalm 26:8\n:\n“\nWe Love Thy House, O God\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 247)\nPsalm 27:1\n:\n“\nThe Lord Is My Light\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 89)\nPsalms 33:1–6\n;\n95:1–6\n:\n“\nFor the Beauty of the Earth\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 92)\nPsalm 37:3–9\n:\n“\nBe Still, My Soul\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 124)\nPsalm 148\n:\n“\nAll Creatures of Our God and King\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 62)\nUse music.\nPresident Dallin H.

Keep that in mind as you read\nPsalm 19:7–11\n. What do these verses suggest to you about the word of the Lord? What does\nPsalm 29\nteach you about His voice? In your experience, how has the word or voice of the Lord matched these descriptions?\nPsalms 24\n;\n26–27\nThe Savior can help me be pure so I can enter God’s presence.\nBecause the temple at Jerusalem was built on a hill, the phrase “hill of the Lord” (\nPsalm 24:3\n) could refer to the temple or to the presence of God. What does this add to your understanding of\nPsalm 24\n? What does it mean to you to have “clean hands, and a pure heart”? (\nverse 4\n). As you read\nPsalms 26–27\n, what else do you learn about the house of the Lord?\nAt times, we might be discouraged to hear that we need to be pure to enter the presence of God. After all, we all struggle, and none of us are perfect. What hope do you find in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nClean Hands and a Pure Heart\n”? (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2007, 80–83). How could you use his message to help someone who feels overwhelmed with wanting to be perfect? Consider how you can receive the Savior’s help in your efforts to have “clean hands, and a pure heart.”\nSee also Bradley R. Wilcox, “\nWorthiness Is Not Flawlessness\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 61–67.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nPsalms 23\n;\n27–28\n;\n32\n;\n46\nThe Lord offers me peace, strength, and guidance.\nConsider writing\nThe Lord is …\nInvite your children to look for ways to complete that sentence using scriptures like these:\nPsalms 23:1\n;\n27:1\n;\n28:1\n;\n28:7\n;\n32:7\n;\n46:1\n. What do these verses teach us about how the Lord can help us?\nYou could discuss with your children what a lamb needs to be safe and healthy. Then, as you read together\nPsalm 23\n, help your children compare what a shepherd does for a lamb with what Jesus does for us. What do we need to be spiritually safe and healthy? Sing together a song that could give them ideas, such as “\nI Feel My Savior’s Love\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 74–75).\nConcepción Chile Temple\nPsalm 24:3–4\nTo enter the temple, we need “clean hands, and a pure heart.”\nAs you read\nPsalm 24:3\ntogether, your children could look for words that remind them of the temple. They could also look at a picture of a temple. Then you could read together\nverse 4\nto learn who can enter the temple. You could talk about how hands get dirty and how we clean them. How do we get spiritually dirty? How does the Savior help clean us spiritually?\nPsalm 30:5\nJesus Christ can turn sadness into joy.\nIf you have young children, you could invite them to pretend to cry while you read from\nPsalm 30:5\n, “Weeping may endure for a night.” Then ask them to express joy as you read, “But joy cometh in the morning.” Repeat this phrase a few times.\nShow a picture of the Savior, and tell your children what He has done for you that brings you joy. You could also give each child a turn to hold the picture and share what Jesus has done that brings them joy.\nPsalm 46:10\n“Be still, and know that I am God.”\nHelp your children memorize the first line from\nPsalm 46:10\n: “Be still, and know that I am God.” What could it mean to “be still”? Maybe you could spend some time practicing being still. You could also share with each other experiences when being “still” strengthened your relationship with God. Help your children think of times during the day when they can “be still” to feel close to Heavenly Father.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe Good Shepherd\n, by Eva Timothy\nOpen PDF"

They wrote about feeling discouraged, afraid, and remorseful. At times, they even felt abandoned by God, and some psalms carry a tone of frustration or desperation. If you’ve ever felt that way, reading the Psalms can help you know that you aren’t the only one. But you’ll also find psalms that can encourage you when you’re having such feelings, because the psalmists also praised the Lord for His goodness, marveled at His power, and rejoiced in His mercy. They knew that we are burdened by evil and sin but that the Lord is “good, and ready to forgive” (\nPsalm 86:5\n). They understood that having faith in the Lord doesn’t mean that you’ll never struggle with anxiety, sin, or fear. It means that you know who to turn to when you do.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nPsalms 49\n;\n62:5–12\nRedemption comes only through Jesus Christ.\nPsalm 49\nhas a message for “both low and high, rich and poor” (\nverse 2\n). What would you say this message is? What do you feel\nPsalm 62:5–12\nadds to that message?\nReading these psalms might inspire you to ponder the ways we are tempted to trust something other than God for redemption (see\nPsalm 49:6–7\n). How is your life influenced by your testimony that “God will redeem [your] soul from the power of the grave”? (\nPsalm 49:15\n).\nPsalms 51\n;\n85–86\nBecause of the Savior’s mercy, I can be forgiven.\nKing David wrote\nPsalm 51\nafter he recognized his desperate need for forgiveness—something we all need. Which verses describe feelings you’ve had? What do you find in this psalm that gives you hope for forgiveness?\nYou might also search\nPsalm 51\nfor clues about what it means to repent. Make a list of what you find. See if you can add to your list by searching President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nWe Can Do Better and Be Better\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 67–69).\nHow would you describe what it feels like to receive forgiveness through Christ? If you need help describing your feelings, you could look in\nPsalms 51:1–2, 7–12\n;\n85:2–9\n. Some people like to draw or find pictures to express their feelings; you might try that. You could also sing or listen to a hymn about the Savior, such as “\nI Stand All Amazed\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 193).\nTo repent, we need faith not only that Jesus Christ\ncan\ncleanse us but also that He\nwill\n. What do you find in\nPsalm 86:5, 13, 15\nthat helps you know the Savior is both able and willing to forgive?\nSee also\nAlma 36\n; Peter F. Meurs, “\nHe Could Heal\nMe\n!,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 39–41.\nPsalms 51:13–15\n;\n66:5–20\n;\n71:15–24\nMy testimony of Jesus Christ can help others come unto Him.\nPonder how you gained your testimony of Jesus Christ and His atoning power. Then, as you study\nPsalms 51:13–15\n;\n66:5–20\n;\n71:15–24\n, think about how you can invite others to “come and see the works of God” (\nPsalm 66:5\n). If you were to “declare what [the Lord] hath done for [your] soul” (\nPsalm 66:16\n), what would you declare?\nWhat does it mean to you to “talk of [His] righteousness all the day long”? (\nPsalm 71:24\n).\nSee also\nAlma 26\n.\n“Come and hear, … and I will declare what [God] hath done for my soul” (\nPsalm 66:16\n).\nPsalms 63\n;\n69\n;\n77–78\nThe Lord will help me in my time of need.\nSeveral psalms describe what it’s like to feel distant from God and desperately need His help (see\nPsalms 63:1, 8\n;\n69:1–8, 18–21\n;\n77:1–9\n). In\nPsalms 63\n;\n69\n;\n77–78\n, what do you find that gave the psalmists reassurance?\nWhen you are distressed, how does it help you to “remember the works of the Lord” and His “wonders of old”? (\nPsalm 77:11\n). Some of those wonders are described in\nPsalm 78\n. As you read about them, ponder what helps you “set [your] hope in God” (\nverse 7\n).\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “Appendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path.”\nPsalms 51\n;\n86:5, 13, 15\nWhen I make a wrong choice, Jesus can help me change.\nTo help your children discover truths about repentance in\nPsalm 51\n, you could draw a large heart. Then you could help your children write inside the heart bad things Satan tempts us to do. How do we get these things out of our hearts? Ask your children to find the word “heart” in\nPsalm 51:10, 17\n. Talk about what these verses teach about repentance. Let your children erase the words inside the heart and write new words that describe the ways Jesus can change us when we repent.\nYou might want to help your children learn what it means to have “a broken and a contrite heart” (\nPsalm 51:17\n). They could take turns breaking open something that has a hard shell, such as an egg or a nut. You could help them compare the shell to things that keep us from feeling Heavenly Father’s love. How can we open our heart to Him?\nYou could also look at a picture of the Savior together and ask your children what words they would use to describe Him. Invite them to find words that describe Him in\nPsalm 86:5, 13, 15\n. Why is it important to know these things about Him?\nPsalm 61:2–3\nJesus Christ is my rock.\nYour children might enjoy drawing pictures of the symbols in\nPsalm 61:2–3\n. How is Jesus Christ like a high “rock” (\nverse 2\n), “a shelter,” and “a strong tower”? (\nverse 3\n).\n“Thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower” (\nPsalm 61:3\n).\nPsalms 66:16\n;\n77:11\n;\n78:6–7\n“I will remember the works of the Lord.”\nAsk your children to share some of their favorite scripture stories (pictures from the\nGospel Art Book\nmight help). What do these stories teach us about the Lord? You could read together\nPsalm 66:16\nand take turns answering the question “What has the Lord done for my soul”?\nAs you read\nPsalms 77:11\n;\n78:6–7\ntogether, you could share with each other how you try to “remember the works of the Lord” (\nPsalm 77:11\n), including His works in your life. How does the sacrament help us “always remember”? (\nMoroni 4:3\n;\n5:2\n).\nPsalm 71:8\nI can tell others about Jesus Christ.\nAfter reading\nPsalm 71:8\nwith your children, invite them to draw a large mouth. Ask them to help you “fill” the mouth with pictures or words representing things we can tell others about Jesus Christ.\nYou could pass around a picture of Jesus Christ. The person holding the picture could say one thing they know about Him. How can we help other people know these things?\nChildren have much to share.\n“When children learn something new, they naturally want to share it with others. Encourage this desire by giving children opportunities to teach gospel principles to each other, their family members, and their friends. Also ask them to share with you their thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to the principles you are teaching. You will find that they have insights that are simple, pure, and powerful” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n32\n).\nPsalm 86:7\nHeavenly Father hears and answers my prayers.\nMany of the psalms are like prayers to God. As you read Psalms with your children, you might show them things we can use to communicate with people who are far away, such as a phone or a letter. Then read\nPsalm 86:7\n. How do we “call upon” Heavenly Father? How does He answer us?\nYou could sing together a song about prayer, such as “\nA Child’s Prayer\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 12–13; see also Susan H. Porter, “\nPray, He Is There\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 77–79). Tell each other about times when God answered your prayers.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nCome unto Christ\n, by Casey Childs\nOpen PDF"

If you had to choose one word to sum up the main message of the Psalms,\npraise\nwould be a good choice. Some psalms contain the direct invitation to “praise ye the Lord” (see especially\nPsalms 146–50\n), and all of them can inspire worship and praise. The Psalms invite us to acknowledge the Lord’s power, His mercy, and the great things He has done. We can never repay Him for any of this, but we can praise Him. That praise might take different forms for different people—it might involve singing, praying, or bearing testimony. It often leads to a deeper commitment to the Lord and to following His teachings. Whatever “praise ye the Lord” means in your life, you can find inspiration to do it as you read and ponder the Psalms.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nPsalms 102–3\n;\n116\nThe Lord can comfort me in my suffering.\nNote how\nPsalm 102:1–11\ndescribes feelings of anxiety and isolation that often come during challenges. Maybe you or others you know have experienced such feelings. As you read\nPsalms 102:12–28\n;\n103\n;\n116\n, look for phrases that give you confidence to “call upon the name of the Lord” in your trials (\nPsalm 116:13\n). You might want to mark, memorize, or share with others phrases that give you hope in Him.\nSee also\nIsaiah 25:8\n;\nHebrews 2:17–18\n;\nAlma 7:11–13\n; Camille N. Johnson, “\nChrist Is Relief\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 81–83; “\nWhere Can I Turn for Peace?\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 129).\nCarl Heinrich Bloch (1834-1890),\nChrist Healing the Sick at Bethesda\n, 1883, oil on canvas, 100 3/4 × 125 1/2 inches. Brigham Young University Museum of Art, purchased with funds provided by Jack R. and Mary Lois Wheatley, 2001.\nPsalms 110\n;\n118\nJesus Christ fulfilled prophecies from the Psalms.\nThe Psalms contain passages that point toward the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Here are a few examples:\nPsalm 110:1–4\n(see\nMatthew 22:41–45\n;\nHebrews 5:4–10\n;\n6:20\n)\nPsalm 118:22\n(see\nMatthew 21:42\n;\nActs 4:10–11\n;\n1 Peter 2:7\n)\nPsalm 118:25–26\n(see\nMatthew 21:9\n)\nWhat do these verses teach you about Jesus Christ? Why is it important to know this about Him?\nPsalm 119\nGod’s word will keep me on His path.\nPsalm 119\ncontains many phrases that compare our lives to a journey back to Heavenly Father. As you read, look for words like “walk,” “path,” “way,” “feet,” and “wander.” Ponder your own life’s journey—where you have been, where you are now, and where you are heading. What do you learn from this psalm about your journey back home? What have you learned by watching the paths of others? According to this psalm, what has God provided to help you stay on His path?\nThink about a time when following a path or a map helped you travel somewhere successfully. What does that experience teach you about following God’s path?\nIn many other scriptures, the Lord and His prophets speak of a path. Below are some examples. Consider searching these verses and writing down or sharing with others what you learn.\nScripture\nWhat I learn about the path to God\nScripture\nProverbs 4:11–19\nScripture\nMatthew 7:13–14\nScripture\n1 Nephi 8:20–28\nScripture\n2 Nephi 31:17–21\nScripture\nAlma 7:9, 19–20\nScripture\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:2\nHow can these truths help you stay on God’s path?\nWhat additional insights can you learn from the following counsel from President Russell M. Nelson?\n“If our journey through life is to be successful, we need to follow divine direction. The Lord said, ‘Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not’ [\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:36\n]. And the Psalmist wrote, ‘Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path’ [\nPsalm 119:105\n]. …\n“In your journey through life, you meet many obstacles and make some mistakes. Scriptural guidance helps you to recognize error and make the necessary correction. You stop going in the wrong direction. You carefully study the scriptural road map. Then you proceed with repentance and restitution required to get on the ‘strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life’ [\n2 Nephi 31:18\n]” (“\nLiving by Scriptural Guidance\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 2000, 17).\nSee also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nThe Prodigal and the Road That Leads Home\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 86–88.\nPsalms 134–36\nThe Lord is more powerful than any idol.\nNotice why, according to\nPsalm 135:15–18\n, it is foolish to trust in false gods. What might you be tempted to trust in that is similar to an idol? You might make a list of the things the Lord can do, as the psalmists did in\nPsalms 134–36\n. What powerful things has He done for you?\nPsalm 139\nThe Lord knows my heart.\nWhat do you find in\nPsalm 139\nthat helps you understand that the Lord is aware of you—your thoughts and actions, strengths and weaknesses? How does this truth influence your life and your choices?\nPsalms 146–50\n“Praise ye the Lord.”\nAs you read these final psalms of praise, think about reasons you have to praise the Lord. Why is it important to praise Him? What are some ways you can praise Him?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nPsalm 102:1–2\nThe Lord comforts me and gives me hope.\nYou or one of your children could read\nPsalm 102:1–2\n, looking for how the Lord helps us during our difficulties. How can we find His help? You could also share with each other times when you needed help and felt that God heard your prayers.\nPsalm 119:105\nGod’s word is like a light.\nYour children might have fun talking about what it feels like to be in the dark. Or they could discuss things that are hard to do in the dark. You might invite them to do something with their eyes closed, such as draw a picture. What do we learn from\nPsalm 119:105\nabout light and the word of God?\nLook for something Heavenly Father has given us to help us stay on His path in the following verses:\nPsalms 119:47–48\n;\n119:105\n;\n1 Nephi 11:25\n;\n2 Nephi 31:20\n. What can we do to stay on God’s path?\nYour children might enjoy looking at pictures of the things mentioned in\nPsalm 119:105\n. They could place the pictures in order as they read the verse.

As you read the lists one at a time, ask the children to guess who you are describing. Then, after reading\nPsalm 139:1–3\ntogether, you could list things that Heavenly Father and Jesus know about us.\nWrite the words of\nPsalm 139:23–24\non a piece of paper or a board. Invite your children to underline words that describe things God can do for us. Why would we want God to do these things?\nPsalm 146:1, 5–9\nI can praise the Lord.\nMaybe your children could share experiences when someone praised them or told them they did a good job.

      "plain_text": "“September 7–13. ‘He Shall Direct Thy Paths’: Proverbs 1–4; 15–16; 22; 31; Ecclesiastes 1–3; 11–12,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“September 7–13. ‘He Shall Direct Thy Paths,’”\nCome, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\nJesus with Children\n, by Dilleen Marsh\nSeptember 7–13: “He Shall Direct Thy Paths”\nProverbs 1–4\n;\n15–16\n;\n22\n;\n31\n;\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n11–12\nYou might think of the book of Proverbs as a collection of wise counsel from loving parents (see\nProverbs 1:8\n). Its main message is that if you seek wisdom—especially God’s wisdom—life will go well. But Proverbs is followed by the book of Ecclesiastes, which seems to say, “It’s not that simple.” The Preacher quoted in Ecclesiastes observed that he “gave [his] heart to know wisdom” but still found “vexation of spirit” and “much grief” (\nEcclesiastes 1:17–18\n). In various ways, the book asks, “Can there be real meaning in a world where everything seems vain, temporary, and uncertain?”\nAnd yet, while the two books look at life from different perspectives, they teach similar truths. Ecclesiastes declares: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man” (\nEcclesiastes 12:13\n). This is the same principle found throughout Proverbs: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart” (\nProverbs 3:5\n; see also\nverse 7\n). Life is always better—if not always perfect—when we trust and follow the Lord Jesus Christ.\nFor an overview of these books, see “\nProverbs, book of\n” and “\nEcclesiastes\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nProverbs 1–4\n;\n15–16\n;\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n11–12\n“Incline thine ear unto wisdom.”\nThe books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are filled with insights about wisdom. Consider marking the word “wisdom” and related words, like “knowledge” and “understanding,” as you find them in\nProverbs 1–4\n;\n15–16\n;\nEcclesiastes 1–3\n;\n11–12\n. How do these chapters affect the way you think about wisdom? Based on what you find, how would you describe the wisdom that “the Lord giveth”? (\nProverbs 2:6\n). What blessings come from God’s wisdom?\nSee also\nMatthew 7:24–27\n;\n25:1–13\n.\nHelp learners share what they’re learning.\n“Give learners opportunities to share with each other what they are learning about the Savior and His gospel. Doing this will help them internalize the truths they are taught and express them. It will also help them gain confidence in their ability to share truths in other settings” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n26\n). For example, you could invite learners to write down some references from Proverbs or Ecclesiastes where they found insights about God’s wisdom. Then invite learners to talk about what they learned.\nProverbs 1:7\n;\n2:5\n;\n3:7\n;\n15:33\n;\n16:6\n;\n31:30\n;\nEcclesiastes 12:13\n“Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord.”\nAnother theme found throughout Proverbs and Ecclesiastes is “the fear of the Lord.” Watch for this phrase as you read. What do you feel it means to fear the Lord? Look for insights in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nTherefore They Hushed Their Fears\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 46–49). How is fear of the Lord different from other kinds of fear?\nSee also\nProverbs 8:13\n.\nProverbs 3:5–7\n;\n4\n“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.”\nHow would you try to persuade someone that it’s better to “trust in the Lord” than to “lean … unto [our] own understanding”? (\nProverbs 3:5\n). What comparisons or object lessons would you use? As you ponder\nProverbs 3:5–7\n, think of ways you might complete sentences like these:\nTrusting the Lord is like … Leaning on our own understanding is like …\nWhy is it unwise to lean on our own understanding? How have you discovered that the Lord is trustworthy?\nEven so, we might find it difficult to trust the Lord at times. Why is that? Elder Gerrit W. Gong suggests some reasons, along with helpful counsel, in “\nTrust Again\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 97–99). What stories or teachings do you find in this message that might help someone restore their trust in the Lord?\nBoth\nProverbs 3:6\nand\nProverbs 4\ncompare life to a “path” or a “way.” What do you think it means to let the Lord “direct [your] paths”? (\nProverbs 3:6\n). What do you find in\nchapter 4\nthat helps you “ponder the path of [your] feet”? (\nverse 26\n). For example, what do\nverses 11–12\nand\n18–19\nteach about the blessings of following the right path? What do\nverses 26–27\nmean to you?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 31:18–21\n; “\nLord, I Would Follow Thee\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 220.\nProverbs 15\n;\n16:24–32\n“A soft answer turneth away wrath.”\nSome of the ideas in\nProverbs 15–16\nmight inspire you to improve the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. For example, think about specific times when “a soft answer” helped to “[turn] away wrath” (\nProverbs 15:1\n).\nYou might also think of times when the Savior exemplified the teachings in\nProverbs 15:1–4, 18\n(see\nMark 12:13–17\n;\nJohn 8:1–11\n). How can you follow His example as you interact with others?\nHow might the counsel in\nProverbs 15\n;\n16:24–32\napply to today’s digital communication?

      "date_range": "",
      "intro": [
        "Prophets and prophecy play a major role throughout the Old Testament. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saw visions and spoke with heavenly messengers. Moses talked to God face to face and communicated His will to the children of Israel. The first and second books of Kings recount the memorable works and messages of the prophets Elijah and Elisha. The Old Testament also speaks of prophetesses like Miriam and Deborah, along with other women blessed with the spirit of prophecy, such as Rebekah and Hannah. And even though the Psalms weren’t written by formal prophets, they too are filled with the spirit of prophecy, especially as they point toward the coming of the Messiah.",
        "None of this comes as a surprise to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In fact, the restored gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that prophets are not just interesting historical figures but an essential part of God’s plan. Although some might see prophets as unique to Old Testament times, we see them as something we have in common with Old Testament times.",
        "But reading a chapter from Isaiah or Ezekiel might feel different from reading a general conference message from the current President of the Church. Sometimes it’s hard to see that ancient prophets had something to say to us. After all, the world we live in today is quite different from the world where they preached and prophesied. And the fact that we do have a living prophet could raise a question: Why is it worth the effort—and it does take effort—to read the words of ancient prophets?",
        "For the most part, people today aren’t the primary audience of the Old Testament prophets. Those prophets had immediate concerns they were addressing in their time and place—just as our latter-day prophets address our immediate concerns today.",
        "At the same time, prophets can also see beyond immediate concerns. They teach eternal truths, relevant to any time and place. Blessed with revelation, they see the wider perspective of God’s work. For example, Isaiah warned people in his time about their sins. He also wrote about the deliverance of Israelites who would live 200 years in the future. At the same time, he taught about the deliverance that all God’s people seek. And he wrote prophecies that, even today, are still waiting to be fulfilled—like promises of “a new earth” ( Isaiah 65:17 ) that will be “full of the knowledge of the Lord” ( Isaiah 11:9 ), where the lost tribes of Israel will be gathered and where “the nations” will not “learn war any more” ( Isaiah 2:4 ). Part of the joy and inspiration that comes from reading the words of Old Testament prophets like Isaiah is realizing that we play a role in the glorious day they envisioned.",
        "So when you read ancient prophecies, it can help to learn about the context in which they were written—but you should also see yourself in them, or “liken them unto [yourself]” ( 1 Nephi 19:24 ; see also verse 23 ). Sometimes that means recognizing Babylon as a symbol of sin and pride, not just as an ancient city. It could mean understanding Israel as God’s people in any time and place. Or it might mean seeing Zion as the latter-day cause that God’s people embrace, instead of seeing it as just another word for Jerusalem.",
        "We can compare the scriptures to our lives because we understand that a prophecy can be fulfilled in multiple ways. A good example is the prophecy in Isaiah 40:3 : “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.” To the captive Jews in Babylon, this statement might have referred to the Lord providing a way out of captivity and back into Jerusalem. To Matthew, Mark, and Luke, this prophecy referred to John the Baptist, who prepared the way for the Savior’s mortal ministry. And Joseph Smith received revelation that this prophecy is still being fulfilled today in preparation for Christ’s millennial ministry. In ways that we’re still coming to understand, ancient prophets did speak to us. And they taught many precious, eternal truths that are just as relevant to us as they were to ancient Israel.",
        "Perhaps even more important than seeing yourself in Old Testament prophecies is seeing Jesus Christ in them. If you look for Him, you will find Him, even if He’s not mentioned by name. It might help to keep in mind that the God of the Old Testament, the Lord Jehovah, is Jesus Christ. Anytime the prophets describe what the Lord is doing or what He will do, they are speaking of the Savior.",
        "You will also find references to an Anointed One, a Redeemer, and a future King from David’s line. These are all prophecies about Jesus Christ. More generally, you will read about deliverance, forgiveness, redemption, and restoration. With the Savior in your mind and heart, these prophecies will naturally point you to the Son of God. After all, the best way to understand prophecy is to have “the spirit of prophecy,” which John tells us is “the testimony of Jesus” ( Revelation 19:10 )."

In ways that we’re still coming to understand, ancient prophets did speak to us. And they taught many precious, eternal truths that are just as relevant to us as they were to ancient Israel."

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saw visions and spoke with heavenly messengers. Moses talked to God face to face and communicated His will to the children of Israel. The first and second books of Kings recount the memorable works and messages of the prophets Elijah and Elisha. The Old Testament also speaks of prophetesses like Miriam and Deborah,\nalong with other women blessed with the spirit of prophecy, such as Rebekah and Hannah.\nAnd even though the Psalms weren’t written by formal prophets, they too are filled with the spirit of prophecy, especially as they point toward the coming of the Messiah.\nNone of this comes as a surprise to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In fact, the restored gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that prophets are not just interesting historical figures but an essential part of God’s plan. Although some might see prophets as unique to Old Testament times, we see them as something we have in\ncommon\nwith Old Testament times.\nBut reading a chapter from Isaiah or Ezekiel might feel different from reading a general conference message from the current President of the Church. Sometimes it’s hard to see that ancient prophets had something to say to us. After all, the world we live in today is quite different from the world where they preached and prophesied. And the fact that we\ndo\nhave a living prophet could raise a question: Why is it worth the effort—and it does take effort—to read the words of ancient prophets?\nFulness of Times\n, by Greg Olsen\nAncient Prophets Have Something to Say to Us\nFor the most part, people today aren’t the primary audience of the Old Testament prophets. Those prophets had immediate concerns they were addressing in their time and place—just as our latter-day prophets address our immediate concerns today.\nAt the same time, prophets can also see beyond immediate concerns. They teach eternal truths, relevant to any time and place. Blessed with revelation, they see the wider perspective of God’s work. For example, Isaiah warned people in his time about their sins. He also wrote about the deliverance of Israelites who would live 200 years in the future. At the same time, he taught about the deliverance that all God’s people seek. And he wrote prophecies that, even today, are still waiting to be fulfilled—like promises of “a new earth” (\nIsaiah 65:17\n) that will be “full of the knowledge of the Lord” (\nIsaiah 11:9\n), where the lost tribes of Israel will be gathered and where “the nations” will not “learn war any more” (\nIsaiah 2:4\n). Part of the joy and inspiration that comes from reading the words of Old Testament prophets like Isaiah is realizing that\nwe\nplay a role in the glorious day they envisioned.\nSo when you read ancient prophecies, it can help to learn about the context in which they were written—but you should also see yourself in them, or “liken them unto [yourself]” (\n1 Nephi 19:24\n; see also\nverse 23\n). Sometimes that means recognizing Babylon as a symbol of sin and pride, not just as an ancient city. It could mean understanding Israel as God’s people in any time and place. Or it might mean seeing Zion as the latter-day cause that God’s people embrace, instead of seeing it as just another word for Jerusalem.\nWe can compare the scriptures to our lives because we understand that a prophecy can be fulfilled in multiple ways.\nA good example is the prophecy in\nIsaiah 40:3\n: “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.” To the captive Jews in Babylon, this statement might have referred to the Lord providing a way out of captivity and back into Jerusalem. To Matthew, Mark, and Luke, this prophecy referred to John the Baptist, who prepared the way for the Savior’s mortal ministry.\nAnd Joseph Smith received revelation that this prophecy is still being fulfilled today in preparation for Christ’s millennial ministry.\nIn ways that we’re still coming to understand, ancient prophets\ndid\nspeak to us. And they taught many precious, eternal truths that are just as relevant to us as they were to ancient Israel.\nAncient Prophets Testified of Jesus Christ\nPerhaps even more important than seeing yourself in Old Testament prophecies is seeing Jesus Christ in them. If you look for Him, you will find Him, even if He’s not mentioned by name. It might help to keep in mind that the God of the Old Testament, the Lord Jehovah,\nis\nJesus Christ. Anytime the prophets describe what the Lord is doing or what He will do, they are speaking of the Savior.\nThe Lord Appearing unto Abraham\n, by Keith Larson\nYou will also find references to an Anointed One, a Redeemer, and a future King from David’s line.\nThese are all prophecies about Jesus Christ. More generally, you will read about deliverance, forgiveness, redemption, and restoration. With the Savior in your mind and heart, these prophecies will naturally point you to the Son of God. After all, the best way to understand prophecy is to have “the spirit of prophecy,” which John tells us is “the testimony of Jesus” (\nRevelation 19:10\n).\nNotes\nIsaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel are often referred to as the Major Prophets because of the length of their books. The other prophets (Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi) are called the Minor Prophets because their books are much shorter. The book of Lamentations is considered part of the Writings, not the Prophets.\nWe don’t know how the prophetic books were compiled. In some cases, a prophet might have overseen the collection of his writings and prophecies. In other cases, his teachings might have been recorded and compiled after his death.\nSee\nExodus 15:20\n;\nJudges 4\n.\nSee\nGenesis 25:21–23\n;\n1 Samuel 1:20–28\n;\n2:1–10\n.\n“Just think of the excitement and urgency of it all: every prophet commencing with Adam has seen our day. And every prophet has talked about\nour\nday, when Israel would be gathered and the world would be prepared for the Second Coming of the Savior. Think of it! Of all the people who have ever lived on planet earth,\nwe\nare the ones who get to participate in this final, great gathering event. How exciting is that!” (Russell M. Nelson, “\nHope of Israel\n” [worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018], Gospel Library). See also Ronald A. Rasband, “\nFulfillment of Prophecy\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 75–78.\nThe Savior, speaking of Isaiah, said, “All things that he spake\nhave been\nand\nshall be\n, even according to the words which he spake” (\n3 Nephi 23:3\n; emphasis added).\nSee\nMatthew 3:1–3\n;\nMark 1:2–4\n;\nLuke 3:2–6\n.\nSee\nDoctrine and Covenants 33:10\n;\n65:3\n;\n88:66\n.\nSee\nIsaiah 9:6–7\n;\n61:1\n;\nHosea 13:14\n;\nZechariah 9:9\n."

That’s because, of all the Old Testament prophets, Isaiah is the one most often quoted in other books of scripture, including by the Savior Himself. Isaiah’s words also appear often in hymns and other sacred music.\nWhy is Isaiah quoted so often? Surely one reason is that Isaiah had a gift for expressing the word of God in vivid, memorable language. But it’s more than that. Isaiah has inspired prophets for generations because the truths he taught transcended his own generation (between 740 and 701 BC). He wrote of God’s great work of redemption, which is much bigger than one nation or one time period. From Isaiah, Nephi learned that he and his people, though separated from the rest of Israel, were still part of God’s covenant people. In Isaiah, New Testament writers found prophecies about the Messiah that were fulfilled right before their eyes. And in Isaiah, Joseph Smith found inspiration for the latter-day work of gathering Israel and building Zion. When you read Isaiah, what will you find?\nFor more about Isaiah and his writings, see “\nIsaiah\n” in the Bible Dictionary. For information about the time when Isaiah lived, see\n2 Kings 15–20\nand\n2 Chronicles 26–32\n.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 1–12\nThe words of Isaiah will all be fulfilled.\nThe Savior taught that “all things that [Isaiah] spake have been and shall be, even according to the words which he spake” (\n3 Nephi 23:3\n). As you study the book of Isaiah, consider making a chart of prophecies with headings like these:\nIsaiah’s day\n,\nThe Savior’s mortal ministry\n, and\nThe latter days\n. Note that many of Isaiah’s prophecies are fulfilled in more than one way (see Bible Dictionary, “\nIsaiah\n”).\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks taught: “The book of Isaiah contains numerous prophecies that seem to have multiple fulfillments. One seems to involve the people of Isaiah’s day or the circumstances of the next generation. Another meaning, often symbolic, seems to refer to events in the meridian of time, when Jerusalem was destroyed and her people scattered after the crucifixion of the Son of God. Still another meaning or fulfillment of the same prophecy seems to relate to the events attending the Second Coming of the Savior. The fact that many of these prophecies can have multiple meanings underscores the importance of our seeking revelation from the Holy Ghost to help us interpret them” (“\nScripture Reading and Revelation\n,”\nEnsign\n, Jan. 1995, 8).\nUnderstanding Isaiah.\nThe Savior said, “Search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah” (\n3 Nephi 23:1\n; see also\nverses 2–3\n). Yet to many, Isaiah can be difficult to understand. The following ideas might help:\nPonder the symbols and metaphors Isaiah used.\nAsk yourself, “What am I learning about Jesus Christ?” (see\n1 Nephi 19:23\n).\nLook for topics that feel relevant to our time.\nUse study helps, such as a dictionary, the footnotes, chapter headings, and the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n.\nIsaiah 1\n;\n3–5\nProphets warn about sin and promise hope through repentance.\nLike prophets in all times, Isaiah continually warned the people about their spiritual condition. As you read\nIsaiah 1\n;\n3\n;\n5\n, look for phrases that describe how the people were doing spiritually (see, for example,\nIsaiah 1:2–4, 21–23\n;\n3:9, 16–17\n;\n5:11–12, 20–23\n). What similar problems do you see in our time? You might also look for verses that warn about the consequences of the Israelites’ spiritual condition (such as\nIsaiah 1:7\n;\n3:17–26\n;\n5:5–7, 13–15\n).\nIn addition to warnings, Isaiah gave messages of hope for redemption through the Savior (see, for example,\nIsaiah 1:16–19, 25–27\n;\n3:10\n;\n4\n). What do you learn about the Lord from these messages? How is the Lord’s message in these verses different from what Satan wants us to believe?\nLike Isaiah, prophets today warn us about sin and its consequences, and they provide messages of hope through Jesus Christ. What examples can you think of? You might want to review a message from a past general conference, looking for such warnings and promises.\nIsaiah 2\n;\n4\n;\n11–12\nGod will do a great work in the latter days.\nMany of Isaiah’s prophecies have specific meaning for our day. To find them, look for future-tense verbs (such as “shall be” or “shall go”). For example, look for these verbs as you read\nIsaiah 2\n;\n4\n;\n11–12\n. You might even try replacing them with present-tense verbs (like\nis\nor\nis going\n). Which prophecies are especially inspiring to you? What do you learn from these prophecies about Zion, building temples, and gathering Israel?\nIsaiah 2:2–3\nis especially relevant for Latter-day Saints. How are these prophecies being fulfilled? What do you learn about the Lord’s “ways” and “paths” in His house? (\nverse 3\n).\nSee also\nIsaiah 5:26\n; “\nHigh on the Mountain Top\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 5.\nIsaiah 6\nProphets are called by God.\nIn\nIsaiah 6\n, Isaiah recounted his call to be a prophet. As you read this chapter, what impresses you about Isaiah’s experience? How does this chapter influence the way you think about the Lord, His prophets, and the work they are called to do?\n“For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given” (\nIsaiah 9:6\n).\nIsaiah 7–9\nGod promised to send Jesus Christ to be my Savior.\nDuring Isaiah’s ministry, Israel formed an alliance with Syria to defend itself against Assyria. Israel and Syria wanted to force Ahaz, the king of Judah, to join them. But Isaiah prophesied that the alliance would fail and counseled Ahaz to trust in the Lord (\nIsaiah 7:7–9\n;\n8:12–13\n).\nWhile Isaiah counseled Ahaz, he made several well-known prophecies, such as those found in\nIsaiah 7:14\n;\n8:13–14\n;\n9:2, 6–7\n. Whatever these prophecies meant to Ahaz, they clearly apply to Jesus Christ (see also\nMatthew 1:21–23\n;\n4:16\n;\n21:44\n;\nLuke 1:31–33\n). Why is “Immanuel” a good title for the Savior? (see\nMatthew 1:23\n). How has He been a “Counsellor” or “Prince of Peace” to you? (\nIsaiah 9:7\n). What else do you learn about the Savior from these verses?\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 1:2–4, 16–19\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I can repent and be clean.\nIn\nIsaiah 1:2–4\n, you and your children could find reasons that the Lord was not happy with the people. Note the comparison with animals in\nverse 3\n—who is our “master”? How do we show that we know Him?\nTo visualize\nIsaiah 1:16–18\n, you and your children could look at something bright red and something pure white. Or maybe you could work together to wash something. How do we become unclean spiritually? How does Jesus help us become clean? What do we learn about the Savior from these verses? Share with your children how you feel about Him and what He has done for you.\nIsaiah 2:2–4\nIn the temple, I learn about Jesus Christ.\nIsaiah foresaw a time when “the mountain of the Lord’s house” would attract people from “all nations” (\nIsaiah 2:2\n). How can you help your children feel excited about going to the Lord’s house? You could invite them to draw a picture of their home.

For Old Testament prophets, this often meant telling the rulers of mighty kingdoms that they needed to repent. It was a dangerous task, but Isaiah was fearless, and his warnings to the kingdoms of his day—including Israel, Judah, and surrounding nations—were bold (see\nIsaiah 13–23\n).\nHowever, Isaiah also had a message of hope. Even though the prophesied destructions did come upon these kingdoms, Isaiah foresaw a chance for restoration and renewal. The Lord would invite His people to return to Him. He would make “the parched ground … become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water” (\nIsaiah 35:7\n). He would perform “a marvellous work and a wonder” (\nIsaiah 29:14\n), restoring to Israel the blessings He had promised them. Neither Isaiah nor anyone else alive at that time lived to see this marvelous work. But we are seeing it today. In fact, we are part of it.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 13:1–11, 19–22\n;\n14:1–20\nPride and worldliness will fail.\nIn Isaiah’s day, Babylon was a mighty kingdom with a powerful ruler. Now Babylon is ancient history. So why is Isaiah’s message to Babylon, in\nIsaiah 13–14\n, important to us today? Because Babylon symbolizes pride, greed, and sin, things that still surround us today. Think about this symbolism as you read\nIsaiah 13:1–11, 19–22\n;\n14:1–20\n. You might consider questions like these:\nWhat similarities do you see between the pride of the Babylonian king and the pride of Satan? (see\nIsaiah 14:4–20\n;\nMoses 4:1–4\n). What warnings do you find for yourself in these verses?\nHow does the Savior provide “rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear”? (\nIsaiah 14:3\n).\n“He will swallow up death in victory” (\nIsaiah 25:8\n).\nIsaiah 22:22–23\n;\n24:21–23\n;\n25:6–8\n;\n26:19\n;\n28:16\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nThe teachings of Isaiah often refer to the Savior’s mission, including His atoning sacrifice, Resurrection, and Second Coming. What aspects of His mission come to mind as you read these verses:\nIsaiah 22:22–23\n;\n24:21–23\n;\n25:6–8\n;\n26:19\n;\n28:16\n? What other passages do you find that remind you of the Savior?\nGive learners opportunities to bear testimony of Jesus Christ.\n“To be a teacher of Jesus Christ’s gospel means to help others understand and rely on His teachings, redeeming power, and perfect love” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n8\n). One simple way to do that every time you teach is to ask a question like “What did you find in the scriptures this week that taught you something about the Savior?” Then let learners share their experiences and strengthen each other’s faith.\nIsaiah 24:1–12\n;\n28:1–8\n;\n29:7–13\n;\n30:8–14\nTurning away from the Lord brings spiritual danger.\nIn His mercy, the Lord sent Isaiah to warn the covenant people that they were straying from Him. See if you can find the spiritual warning signs of this in\nIsaiah 24:5\n;\n29:13\n;\n30:8–12\n. Why are these attitudes and actions spiritually dangerous?\nTo warn about the consequences of turning away from the Lord, Isaiah used some memorable comparisons. As you study them, ask yourself how turning away from the Lord is like:\nA sad, empty earth (\nIsaiah 24:1–12\n).\nDrunkenness (\nIsaiah 28:7–8\n).\nHunger and thirst (\nIsaiah 29:7–10\n).\nA broken wall or vessel (\nIsaiah 30:13–14\n).\nWhy is it important to you to stay close to the Lord?\nIsaiah 29\n;\n30:18–26\n;\n35\nThe Lord can restore what is lost or broken.\nHave you ever lost something that you thought you would never find again? Or maybe something broke, and you worried that it could never be repaired. When we turn away from the Lord, Satan wants us to think that we can never return or be healed. However, Isaiah described some of the marvelous things the Lord will do to help us return to Him. What do you learn from\nIsaiah 29:13–24\n;\n30:18–26\n;\n35\nabout the Lord, His love, and His power? Perhaps you could find a phrase in these passages that gives you hope when you need healing. You could also look in Sister Amy A. Wright’s message “\nChrist Heals That Which Is Broken\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 81–84).\nOne way the Lord manifests His power and mercy is through the Restoration of His gospel.\nIsaiah 29\ncontains several passages that have parallels with events of the Restoration. For example:\nCompare\nIsaiah 29:11–12\nwith\n2 Nephi 27:6–26\nand\nJoseph Smith—History 1:63–65\n.\nCompare\nIsaiah 29:13–14\nwith\nDoctrine and Covenants 4\nand\nJoseph Smith—History 1:17–19\n.\nCompare\nIsaiah 29:18–24\nwith the\ntitle page of the Book of Mormon\n.\nIn your opinion, why are “marvellous” and “wonder” (\nIsaiah 29:14\n) good words to describe the Lord restoring His gospel? How can you help fulfill the prophecies about the Restoration? For ideas, look in Elder Gerrit W.

It marks the beginning of a different tone, a different emphasis in the prophet’s message. Isaiah’s earlier writings warned Israel and Judah about destruction and captivity that would come because of their sins. But these later prophecies were meant to comfort the Jewish people over 150 years in the future—after Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed and the people were taken captive by Babylon. These prophecies, however, reach even further into the future than to the defeated, disheartened Israelites. They speak to us, who also sometimes feel defeated, disheartened, and even lost.\nIsaiah’s message to his people and to us is simple: “Fear not” (\nIsaiah 43:1\n). All is not lost. The Lord has not forgotten you, and He has power over situations that seem out of your control. Isn’t the Lord, who “created the heavens” (\nIsaiah 42:5\n), more powerful than Babylon, than sin, than whatever is holding you captive? “Return unto me,” He pleads, “for I have redeemed thee” (\nIsaiah 44:22\n). He can heal, restore, strengthen, forgive, and comfort—whatever is needed for you, in your case, to be redeemed.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 40–49\nJesus Christ can comfort me and give me hope.\nWhen the Israelites were captives in Babylon, many may have wondered if they had forever lost their place as God’s chosen, covenant people. As you read\nIsaiah 40–49\n, look for passages that might have provided comfort and hope. For each passage you find, ponder and record what the Lord might be saying to\nyou\nin these verses. Here are a few you might start with:\n40:11, 29–31\n:\n41:10–13, 17–18\n:\n42:6–7\n:\n43:1–7, 25\n:\n44:1–4, 21–24\n:\n46:3–4\n:\n49:7–16\n:\nWhat do you feel the Lord wants you to know about Him?\nYou might notice that the hymn “\nHow Firm a Foundation\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 85) draws on Isaiah’s words in\nIsaiah 41:10\n;\n43:2–5\n;\n46:4\n. Consider singing or listening to this hymn, looking for parallels between the lyrics and these verses from Isaiah. How has the Lord fulfilled the promises in these verses in your life?\nSee also Patrick Kearon, “\nHe Is Risen with Healing in His Wings: We Can Be More Than Conquerors\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 37–40.\nUse additional scripture.\nSometimes we can understand the Old Testament better if we supplement our study with verses from the Book of Mormon. For example, the Book of Mormon prophets Nephi and Jacob had access to the writings of Isaiah on the plates of brass (see\n1 Nephi 19:22–23\n), and they used these prophecies to teach about the Savior. To learn how Nephi and Jacob likened\nIsaiah 48–49\nto their people, see\n1 Nephi 22\n. That may help you liken these chapters to your own life.\nBy obeying the Lord, we can have “peace … as a river” (\nIsaiah 48:18\n).\nIsaiah 40–49\n“Thou art my servant.”\nThroughout\nIsaiah 40–49\nthe Lord speaks of His “servant” and His “witnesses.” These words can refer to Jesus Christ (see\nIsaiah 42:1–7\n), to the house of Israel (see\nIsaiah 45:4\n), and to King Cyrus, who allowed the Jewish people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (see\nIsaiah 44:26–28\n;\n45:1–4\n). You might also consider how the passages apply to you as a servant and a witness of the Lord. For example, ponder questions like these:\nIsaiah 40:1–3, 9–11\n;\n43:9–12\n.\nIn what sense are you a witness of Jesus Christ? What are the “good tidings” that you can share as His witness? You might imagine that you have been called to the witness stand in a court trial. In this trial, Jesus Christ has been charged with making the claim recorded in\nIsaiah 43:11\n. What testimony could you give in support of Jesus’s claim? What evidence from your life would you present?\nIsaiah 41:8–13\n;\n42:6\n;\n44:21\n.\nWhat has the Lord called you to do?

These prophecies would have been especially precious to the Israelites centuries later when they were in captivity in Babylon. Someone who could tear down the walls of Babylon would be a mighty conqueror indeed. But that isn’t the kind of Messiah that Isaiah described in\nchapters 52–53\n: “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him. … We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted” (\nIsaiah 53:3–4\n).\nBy sending such an unexpected deliverer, God taught us about true deliverance. To save us from oppression and affliction, God sent One who Himself “was oppressed, and … afflicted.” Where some expected a lion, He sent a lamb (see\nIsaiah 53:7\n). Surely, God’s ways are not our ways (see\nIsaiah 55:8–9\n). Jesus Christ frees us not by just opening the prison but by taking our place there. He relieves us from our chains of grief and sorrow by bearing them Himself (see\nIsaiah 53:4–5, 12\n). He does not save us from a distance. He suffers with us, in acts of “everlasting kindness” that “shall not depart from thee” (\nIsaiah 54:8, 10\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 50–52\nThe future is bright for the Lord’s people.\nEven though the Israelites spent many years in captivity—and even though that captivity was a result of their own poor choices—the Lord wanted them to look to the future with hope. What do you find in Isaiah’s message that gives you hope? A chart like this one might help you study:\nWhat I learn about God\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:2, 5–9\n;\n51:3–8, 15–16\n;\n52:3, 9–10\n)\nMessages of hope\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:9\n;\n51:3–5, 11–12, 22–23\n;\n52:9–10\n)\nWhat I can do to make hope a reality\n(see, for example,\nIsaiah 50:10\n;\n51:1–2, 6–9\n;\n52:1–3, 9–11\n)\nSee also\nMosiah 12:20–24\n;\n15:13–18\n;\n3 Nephi 20:29–46\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 113:7–10\n; Russell M.

He stood there to read from the scriptures, opened the book of Isaiah, and read what we now know as\nIsaiah 61:1–2\n. He then announced, “This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.” This was one of the Savior’s most straightforward declarations that He was the Anointed One, who would “heal the brokenhearted” and “preach deliverance to the captives” (see\nLuke 4:16–21\n). This scripture was indeed fulfilled on that day. And, like many other prophecies of Isaiah, it is also being fulfilled in our day. The Savior continues to heal the brokenhearted who come unto Him. There are still many captives who need deliverance. And there is a glorious future to prepare for—a time when the Lord will “create new heavens and a new earth” (\nIsaiah 65:17\n) and “cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations” (\nIsaiah 61:11\n). Reading Isaiah opens our eyes to what the Lord has already done, what He is doing, and what He will yet do for His people.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nIsaiah 58:3–12\nFasting builds spiritual power and blesses people in need.\nWhy would anyone voluntarily go without food when food is available? As you study\nIsaiah 58:3–12\n, you might think about your reasons for fasting—as well as the Lord’s reasons for giving this law. Here are some other questions to ponder:\nWhy can fasting sometimes be perceived like more of a burden than a blessing? (see\nIsaiah 58:3–5\n). How do the Lord’s teachings in this chapter change that perception for you?\nWhat might it mean to “loose the bands of wickedness” and “break every yoke”? (\nIsaiah 58:6\n). How can fasting bless others? (see\nverse 7\n).\nHow has fasting brought you the blessings described in\nIsaiah 58:8–12\n?\nIn his message “\nIs Not This the Fast That I Have Chosen?\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 22–25), President Henry B. Eyring shared several examples of how people have been blessed by fasting and fast offerings. How have you witnessed similar blessings in your life?\nSee also “\nBless Our Fast, We Pray\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 138; Topics and Questions, “\nFasting and Fast Offerings,\n” Gospel Library.\nGet to know the people you teach.\n“Being a Christlike teacher includes getting to know the people you teach and striving to understand what is in their hearts. … You can find out how they learn best.

Cordon, “\nThat They May See\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 78–80.\nIsaiah 64:1–5\n;\n65:17–25\n;\n66\nChrist will reign on earth during the Millennium.\nIsaiah spoke of a day when “the former troubles are forgotten” (\nIsaiah 65:16\n). While this prophecy has several fulfillments, in its fullest sense, that day is yet to come—when Jesus Christ will return. Isaiah described this future day in\nIsaiah 64:1–5\n;\n65:17–25\n;\n66\n. Notice how often he used words like “rejoice” and “rejoicing.” Why will the Savior’s return be a day of rejoicing for you? What can you do to prepare for His coming?\nSee also\nArticles of Faith 1:10\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Future of the Church: Preparing the World for the Savior’s Second Coming\n,”\nEnsign\n, Apr. 2020, 13–17.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nIsaiah 58:6–11\nFasting blesses me and others in need.\nPerhaps the best way to encourage your children to fast—when they are ready—is to help them understand the Lord’s purposes for this law. Consider reading together\nIsaiah 58:6–11\nto find answers to these questions: Why do we fast? How do we fast? You could also look in “\nFast, Fasting\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures.\nIf you have had a meaningful experience with fasting, share it with your children. You could also ask them how they would explain to a friend why the Lord gave us this law.\nIsaiah 58:13–14\nThe Sabbath can be a delight to me.\nAfter reading\nIsaiah 58:13–14\n, you could point to the days of the week on a calendar and invite your children to say the days with you. When you get to the Sabbath, ask them to call that day “a delight.” Tell them why the Sabbath is a delight to you.\nShare with each other ways you can “delight thyself in the Lord” on the Sabbath. Maybe your children could draw their ideas and put them in a “box of Sabbath delights.” Then, when they need ideas about things to do on the Sabbath, they could pull an idea from the box.\nOur Light\n, by Dan Wilson\nIsaiah 60:1–3\nThe Savior is like a light for me.\nYou could invite your children to close their eyes as you read\nIsaiah 60:1–3\n. Ask them to open their eyes when they hear the word “light” and close them again when they hear the word “darkness.” Explain that Jesus Christ and His gospel are like a light that helps us see our way back to Heavenly Father.\nIsaiah 65:17–25\nWhen Jesus comes again, He will bring peace and joy.\nIsaiah 65:17–25\ndescribes what the earth will be like when the Savior comes again. As you read these verses with your children, help them look for how life will be different in the “new earth” Isaiah described. Why will this be a time to be “glad and rejoice for ever”? (\nverse 18\n).\nYou could also sing together a song about the Second Coming, such as “\nWhen the Savior Comes Again\n” (Gospel Library). Share with each other what you are looking forward to about the Savior’s return. What can we do to prepare for that day?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n“Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee” (\nIsaiah 60:1\n).\nLight and Life\n, by Mark Mabry\nOpen PDF"

But the Lord reassured him, “I have put my words in thy mouth” (\nverse 9\n). Jeremiah felt that he was an inexperienced “child” (\nverse 6\n), but the Lord explained that he was actually more prepared than he realized—he had been ordained to this calling even before he was born (see\nverse 5\n). So Jeremiah set aside his fears and accepted the call. He warned Jerusalem’s kings and priests that their pretended holiness would not save them. The “child” who thought he could not speak came to feel God’s word “in [his] heart as a burning fire” and could not be silent (\nJeremiah 20:9\n).\nJeremiah’s story is also your story. God knew you, too, before you were born and prepared you for your mission in life. Among other things, that mission includes something Jeremiah foresaw: gathering God’s people, one by one, to “bring [them] to Zion” (\nJeremiah 3:14\n). And even if you don’t know exactly what to do or say, you can “be not afraid … ; for I am with thee, saith the Lord” (\nJeremiah 1:8, 19\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Jeremiah, see “\nJeremiah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJeremiah 1:4–19\n;\n7:1–7\n;\n20:8–9\nProphets are called to speak God’s word.\nImagine you’re talking to a friend who has never heard of prophets, and you decide to explain the concept using Jeremiah’s call to be a prophet in\nJeremiah 1:4–19\n. What do you find in these verses that teaches something about prophets of God? You could also look in\nJeremiah 7:1–7\n;\n20:8–9\nand a hymn like “\nWe Listen to a Prophet’s Voice\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 22).\nYou might also want to teach your friend about today’s living prophet. Is there anything in these verses that might help? For example, what do prophets in our day “root out” or “pull down”? What do they “build” and “plant”? (\nJeremiah 1:10\n). How have you come to know that our living prophet is called of God?\nSee also\nArticles of Faith 1:6, 9\n; “Why Do We Have Prophets?” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nWhy Do We Have Prophets?\nJeremiah 1:5\nGod knew me before I was born.\nWhat did Jeremiah learn about himself in\nJeremiah 1:5\n? As a newly called prophet, why would that information be important for him to know?\nMuch of what Jeremiah learned about himself in\nJeremiah 1:5\nis also true about you. God also knew you before you were born and prepared you for specific responsibilities. To learn more about your life before you were born, read\nAlma 13:1–4\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 138:53–56\n; and\nAbraham 3:22–23\n. You might make a list of truths you discover. Why is this information important for you to know?\nTo learn about how these truths affected the life of Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt, study his message “\nYou Can Gather Israel!\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 61–63). How does knowing about your premortal life affect the way you live your mortal life?\nHere is what President Russell M. Nelson said about your premortal life:\n“Your Heavenly Father has known you for a very long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth. You were chosen\nnot\nfor your bodily characteristics but for your\nspiritual\nattributes, such as bravery, courage, integrity of heart, a thirst for truth, a hunger for wisdom, and a desire to serve others.\n“You developed some of these attributes premortally. Others you can develop here on earth as you persistently seek them” (“\nDecisions for Eternity\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 107).\nThink of some situations you might face in which it would be important to remember these truths about your premortal life. What can you do to remind yourself of these truths?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nDecisions for Eternity\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 106–9; Topics and Questions, “\nForeordination\n,” “\nPremortal Life\n,” Gospel Library.\nIn\nJeremiah 2:13\n, the Lord compared the people’s spiritual state to “broken cisterns” and compared Himself to the “fountain of living waters.”\nJeremiah 2\n;\n7\n“They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters.”\nIn the dry region where the Israelites lived, people stored precious water in underground reservoirs called cisterns. What do you think the “broken cisterns” mentioned in\nJeremiah 2:13\nmight symbolize? Why would receiving water from a fountain be better than relying on a cistern? What does it mean to forsake “the fountain of living waters”? As you read\nJeremiah 2\nand\n7\n, notice how the people were forsaking the Lord’s living waters (see, for example,\nJeremiah 2:26–28\n;\n7:2–11\n). Why is “living water” a good symbol for what the Savior gives you? Think about how you are receiving living water.\nJeremiah 7\nis addressed to people who were entering “the Lord’s house … to worship the Lord,” but their actions didn’t match their outward devotion (see\nverses 2–11\n). What messages do you feel the Lord might have for you in\nverses 21–23\n?\nUse object lessons.\nThe Lord’s prophets often compare spiritual truths to familiar objects. Consider doing the same as you learn and teach the gospel. For example, to visualize\nJeremiah 2:13\n, you could put water in a cracked or broken container or drink from a drinking fountain. How is Jesus like a “fountain of living waters”? (\nJeremiah 2:13\n). How do we drink from His living water?\nJeremiah 3:14–18\n;\n16:14–21\nThe Lord will gather His people.\nIn\nJeremiah 16:14–15\n, Jeremiah compared the gathering of Israel in the latter days with the Exodus of Israel from Egypt. In your opinion, why would the gathering be even more important to God’s people than the Exodus?\nWhat do\nJeremiah 3:14–18\n;\n16:14–21\nsuggest about how the gathering happens?\nIn his message “\nHope of Israel\n,” President Russell M. Nelson, like Jeremiah, taught that the gathering of Israel “is the most important thing taking place on earth today” (worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018, Gospel Library). Read or listen to his message, and see if you can discover (a) how President Nelson defines the gathering of Israel, (b) how he describes its importance, and (c) how you can be part of the gathering.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJeremiah 1:5\nHeavenly Father knew me before I was born.\nTo introduce the important truth taught in\nJeremiah 1:5\n, you could show your children a picture of a baby (or, if possible, you could look at pictures of your children when they were babies). Ask your children if they know where they lived before they were born. You could also sing together a song that teaches about our premortal life, such as “\nI Lived in Heaven\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 4).\nIf your children would like to learn more, you could help them find “\nPremortal Life\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures. They could look for answers to “who,” “when,” and “what” questions about the premortal life.\nJeremiah 1:4–19\nProphets are called to speak the words of the Lord.\nConsider showing pictures of the living prophet or prophets from the scriptures (you can find some in\nChurch magazines\n, the\nGospel Art Book\n, and\nCome, Follow Me\n). Ask your children what they know about these prophets.\nTo teach about what prophets do, you might select some helpful verses from\nJeremiah 1\n, such as\nverses 5, 7, 10\n, and\n19\n. Your children could each pick one of the verses, read it, and share something they learn about prophets.\nJeremiah 16:14–16\nI can help Heavenly Father’s children come back to Him.\nWhile you read\nJeremiah 16:16\n, your children could pretend to “fish” or “hunt” for objects around the room. President Russell M. Nelson has compared the fishers and hunters in this verse to missionaries (see “\nThe Gathering of Scattered Israel\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2006, 81). What do missionaries do? How can we help “fish” and “hunt” for scattered Israel? (see “A Message for Children from President Russell M. Nelson” [video],\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nVideo: A Message for Children from President Russell M. Nelson\nJeremiah 18:1–6\nI can let the Lord guide my life, like a potter shapes clay.\nTo explore these verses, you might discuss or show how pottery is made (see the picture at the end of this outline). What message does the Lord have for us in\nJeremiah 18:1–6\n? What does it mean to be clay in the Lord’s hands? (see also\nIsaiah 64:8\n). For another story that compares us to potter’s clay, see Elder Richard J. Maynes’s message “\nThe Joy of Living a Christ-Centered Life\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2015, 27–30).\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n“Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel” (\nJeremiah 18:6\n).\nOpen PDF"

But this was only part of Jeremiah’s mission—he was also called “to build, and to plant” (\nJeremiah 1:10\n). What could be built or planted in the desolate ruins left by the rebellion of the covenant people? Asked another way, when sin or adversity has left our lives in ruins, how can we rebuild and plant again? The answer lies in “the Branch of righteousness” (\nJeremiah 33:15\n), the promised Messiah. He brings “a new covenant” (\nJeremiah 31:31\n)—one that requires more than the outward appearance of devotion. His law must be “in [our] inward parts,” written “in [our] hearts.” That’s what it means for the Lord to “be [our] God” and for us to “be [His] people” (\nJeremiah 31:33\n). It’s a lifelong process, and we will still make mistakes and have cause to mourn from time to time. But when we do, the Lord promises, “I will turn their mourning into joy” (\nJeremiah 31:13\n).\nFor an overview of Lamentations, see “\nLamentations, Book of\n” in the Guide to the Scriptures.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJeremiah 31\n;\n33\nThe Lord will bring His covenant people out of captivity.\nIn\nJeremiah 31\n;\n33\nthe Lord acknowledged the “lamentation, and bitter weeping” (\nJeremiah 31:15\n) the Israelites would experience in captivity. However, he also offered words of comfort and hope. Look for them as you read these chapters. What promises do you find that apply to you?\nJeremiah 31:31–34\n;\n32:37–42\n“They shall be my people, and I will be their God.”\nAlthough the Israelites had broken their covenants, Jeremiah prophesied that the Lord would again establish a “new” and “everlasting covenant” with them (\nJeremiah 31:31\n;\n32:40\n). What is that covenant? Consider looking for insights in Guide to the Scriptures, “\nNew and Everlasting Covenant\n,” Gospel Library.\nAs you read\nJeremiah 31:31–34\n;\n32:37–42\n, ponder:\nWhat it means to you to be part of God’s covenant people.\nWhat it means to have His law written in your heart.\nWhat the Lord promises when you make covenants with Him.\nHow your covenant relationship with the Lord changes you.\nWhat promises have you made to God as you have participated in sacred ordinances? How is He fulfilling His promises to you?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nAbide in Me, and I in You; Therefore Walk with Me\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 123–26.\nJeremiah 36\nThe scriptures have power to turn me away from evil.\nAccording to\nJeremiah 36:2–3\n, why did the Lord command Jeremiah to record his prophecies? As you read\nJeremiah 36\n, note how the following people felt about these prophecies:\nThe Lord (see\nverses 1–3, 27–31\n)\nJeremiah (see\nverses 4–7, 32\n)\nBaruch (see\nverses 4, 8–10, 14–18\n)\nJehudi and King Jehoiakim (see\nverses 20–26\n)\nElnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah (see\nverse 25\n)\nPonder how you feel about the scriptures. How have they helped you turn away from evil?\nJeremiah 37–39\nBe firm in following God’s prophets.\nIn\nJeremiah 37:1–3, 15–21\n;\n38:1–6, 14–28\n, what evidence do you see that King Zedekiah believed Jeremiah was the Lord’s true prophet? What evidence do you see that Zedekiah did not believe? What do you learn from this comparison? As you read\nJeremiah 39\n, ponder the difference it would have made if Zedekiah and his people had followed the prophet and kept the commandments of the Lord. (Compare what happened to Zedekiah with what happened to Lehi’s family in\n1 Nephi 1–2\n.)\nJeremiah 38:6–13\n;\n39:15–18\nI can be bold in standing up for what is right.\nThe king’s officials felt that Jeremiah’s prophecies were making their soldiers less willing to fight, so they threw Jeremiah into a filthy dungeon (see\nJeremiah 38:1–4\n). In\nJeremiah 38:6–13\n, what impresses you about the response of Ebed-melech the Ethiopian? Notice also the blessing the Lord gave Ebed-melech in\nJeremiah 39:15–18\n.\nHow could you follow Ebed-melech’s example?\nThe Cry of Jeremiah\nLamentations 1\n;\n3\nThe Lord can relieve the sorrow I experience because of sin.\nThe book of Lamentations is a collection of poems written after the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. Why do you think it is important they were preserved? Consider what the metaphors in\nLamentations 1\nand\n3\nhelp you understand about the great sorrow Israel felt. What messages of hope in Christ do you find? (see especially\nLamentations 3:20–33\n; see also\nMatthew 5:4\n;\nJames 4:8–10\n;\nAlma 36:17–20\n).\nPresident M. Russell Ballard mentioned several situations that may cause some to lose hope, and he offered counsel about where to find hope:\n“Some of us may find our lives laden with frustration, disappointment, and sorrow. Many feel helpless to deal with the chaos that seems to prevail in the world. Others anguish over family members who are being carried downstream in a swift, raging current of weakening values and declining moral standards. … Many have even resigned themselves to accept the wickedness and cruelty of the world as being irreparable. They have given up hope. …\n“… Some among us may have lost all hope because of sin and transgression. A person can become so deeply immersed in the ways of the world that he sees no way out and loses all hope. My plea to all who have fallen into this trap of the adversary is to never give up! Regardless of how desperate things may seem or how desperate they may yet become, please believe me, you can always have hope. Always” (“\nThe Joy of Hope Fulfilled\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1992, 31–32).\nSee also “\nCome, Ye Disconsolate\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 115.\nHelp others take responsibility for their own learning.\nSometimes it seems like the easiest way to teach is to just tell learners what we think they should know. However, the easiest way is not always the best way. Elder David A. Bednar taught: “Our intent ought not to be ‘What do I tell them?’ Instead, the questions to ask ourselves are ‘What can I invite them to do? What inspired questions can I ask that, if they are willing to respond, will begin to invite the Holy Ghost into their lives?’” (\nevening with a General Authority\n, Feb. 7, 2020, broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see also\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n25\n). There are many ways to help learners take responsibility for their learning. For example, in this outline learners are invited to search, ponder, make lists, look at pictures, participate in object lessons, draw, and share and apply what they learn.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nJeremiah 31:3\nHeavenly Father and Jesus love me “with an everlasting love.”\nAs you read\nJeremiah 31:3\nwith your children, they could help you find objects (or pictures of objects) that last a long time, such as a metal coin, and some that do not, such as a piece of fruit. You could talk about what “everlasting” means and share with each other how you have felt Heavenly Father’s “everlasting love.” You could also sing together a song like “\nGod Is Watching Over All\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 229).\nJeremiah 31:31–34\n;\n32:38–41\nGod will help me keep my covenants.\nYour children might enjoy drawing a heart on a piece of paper and then writing in the heart things they learn from\nJeremiah 31:31–34\nabout making covenants with God. You may want to review the covenant they make at baptism (see\nMosiah 18:10, 13\n) and discuss what it means to have these promises written in their hearts.\nJeremiah 36:1–4\nThe scriptures are the word of God.\nThis week’s activity page could help your children learn about Jeremiah, Baruch, and the king (see\nJeremiah 36\n). They could also do actions that go along with the words in\nJeremiah 36:4–10\n, such as writing in a book (see\nverse 4\n) and reading the scriptures to the people (see\nverses 8, 10\n).\nYou and your children could look at a children’s book and a copy of the scriptures and talk about how these books are different. What makes the scriptures special? It may be inspiring to share with each other some scripture passages that are special to you.\nJeremiah 38:6–13\nI can stand up for what is right.\nYou could use the picture at the end of the outline to help your children visualize the story of Ebed-melech in\nJeremiah 38:6–13\n. Maybe you could help them find a verse where Ebed-melech did something brave to help the Lord’s prophet. What can we do to show that we know our prophet today is called of God?\nLamentations 1:1–2, 16\n;\n3:22–26\nThe Savior made it possible for me to be forgiven of my sins.\nTo introduce Lamentations, you may want to explain to your children that because the Israelites had not repented, Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed. You could share with each other how you might have felt if you were living there at that time (see\nLamentations 1:1–2, 16\n). How might the message in\nLamentations 3:22–26\nhave given you hope?\nYou could also tell each other about times you felt sad about a bad choice you made.

Along with other Israelites, he had been captured and sent to Babylon. In Jerusalem, Ezekiel would have been a priest serving in the temple. In Babylon, he was among “them of the captivity,” and he “sat where they sat” (\nEzekiel 3:15\n), hundreds of miles from the beloved house of God and with little hope of returning. Then one day Ezekiel had a vision. He saw “the glory of the Lord” (\nEzekiel 1:28\n)—not back in the temple at Jerusalem but there in Babylon among the exiles. The wickedness in Jerusalem, he learned, had become so severe that God’s presence was no longer there (see\nEzekiel 8–11\n;\n33:21\n).\nAnd yet there’s something hopeful about Ezekiel’s message. Despite how far the covenant people had fallen, God had not totally abandoned them. If they would “hear the word of the Lord” (\nEzekiel 37:4\n), what was once dead could be revived. Their “stony heart” could be replaced with “a new heart” (\nEzekiel 36:26\n). And in the future, the Lord would establish a new temple and a new Jerusalem, “and the name of the city from that day shall be, The Lord is there” (\nEzekiel 48:35\n).\nFor an overview of the book of Ezekiel, see “\nEzekiel\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEzekiel 3\n;\n34\nThe Lord invites me to feed His sheep.\nIn\nEzekiel 3\nand\n34\n, the Lord refers to leaders of His people as watchmen and shepherds. As you read these chapters, consider what these titles suggest about what it means to be a leader.\nWho are the “sheep” the Lord wants you to feed? What do you find in\nEzekiel 34\nthat could help someone preparing to serve a mission, raising children, or fulfilling a ministering assignment? How can you follow the Savior’s example as our shepherd? (see\nverses 11–31\n).\nYou might also ponder the symbolism you find in this chapter. What might the “good pasture” and “good fold” represent in\nverse 14\n? What’s the difference between a sheep who is “lost” and one who is “driven away”? (\nverse 16\n). What other symbols do you find?\nSee also\nJohn 21:15–17\n; Gerrit W. Gong, “\nMinistering\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 16–19.\nEzekiel 33:10–19\nThe Lord wants to forgive.\n“If our … sins be upon us,” the captive Israelites wondered, “how should we then live?” (\nEzekiel 33:10\n). In response, the Lord taught them about repentance and forgiveness. These questions might help you ponder what He taught:\nWhat do you think it means to “trust to [your] own righteousness”? (see\nEzekiel 33:12–13\n).\nWhat would you say to someone who feels that the people described in\nEzekiel 33:12–19\nare not being treated fairly? (see also\nMatthew 21:28–31\n;\nLuke 18:9–14\n).\nWhat do you find in these verses that helps you understand what it means to repent? What additional insights do you find in\nEzekiel 36:26–27\nand\nAlma 7:14–16\n?\nEzekiel 37\nThe Lord is gathering His people and giving them new life.\nThe gathering of Israel is portrayed in\nEzekiel 37\nthrough two symbols. As you read about the first one—dead bones being restored to life (see\nverses 1–14\n)—ponder what it suggests to you about gathering Israel on both sides of the veil (see also\nEzekiel 36:24–30\n). Consider questions like these:\nWhat is the Lord trying to accomplish through the gathering of Israel?\nHow is He accomplishing it?\nYou could ask yourself these same questions as you read about the second symbol, in\nverses 15–28\n. This symbol involves two sticks, which many scholars interpret as wooden writing boards joined by a hinge.

But none of us get through this life without a trial of faith. So we can all benefit from the examples of people like Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who were taken captive as young men by the mighty Babylonian Empire (see\n2 Kings 24:10–16\n). Surrounded by an unfamiliar culture with different values, they faced great temptations to abandon their beliefs and righteous traditions. Yet they remained true to their covenants. How did they do it? By doing those small and simple things God asks of all of us—praying, fasting, choosing good friends, trusting in Him, and being a light to others. Like Joseph in Egypt and Esther in Persia, Daniel and his friends in Babylon kept their faith in God, and God worked miracles that still inspire believers to this day.\nFor an overview of the book of Daniel, see “\nDaniel\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nDaniel 1\n;\n3\n;\n6\nI can trust in the Lord when my faith is tried.\nIn a sense, we all live in Babylon.

Also consider the following questions:\nWhen have you felt pressured to do something you knew was wrong? How has the Lord blessed you for keeping His commandments?\nWhat if your faith doesn’t lead to the miracles you seek? (for an example, see\nAlma 14:8–13\n).

        "Hosea’s wife, Gomer, was unfaithful to him, and God pointed to this sad event to teach the Israelites how He felt about them and their covenants with Him. As you read Hosea 1–3 , ponder how the Lord views His relationship with His covenant people. How is making a covenant with the Lord like entering into a marriage? How is failing to keep that covenant like being unfaithful to a spouse? (see Hosea 2:5–7, 13 ). What does Hosea 2:14–23 teach you about the Lord’s love and mercy? How do you show Him your love and loyalty?",
        "In Hosea 14 , look for the many beautiful promises the Lord makes to those who return to Him. What does the phrase “love them freely” mean to you? ( verse 4 ). What do the plant metaphors in verses 5–8 teach you about the Lord’s blessings, including the blessings of repentance? As part of your study, consider singing or listening to a hymn about the Savior’s mercy, such as “ Come unto Jesus ” ( Hymns , no. 117).",
        "The people in Hosea’s day were offering animal sacrifices, but they were breaking more important commandments. What do you think it means that the Lord “desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings”? ( Hosea 6:6 ). What do you think it means for righteousness to be like a cloud or like dew? (see Hosea 6:4 ). What should our righteousness be like? (see Isaiah 48:18 ; 1 Nephi 2:9–10 ).",
        "You could also read Matthew 9:10–13 ; 12:1–8 to see how the Savior used Hosea 6:6 during His ministry. How do these passages help you understand Hosea’s words?",
        "When reading Joel 2:12–13 , it might help to know that rending or tearing one’s clothing was an outward sign of mourning or remorse. How is rending our hearts different from rending our garments?",
        "What similarities do you see between our day and the day Joel foresaw? (see especially Joel 2:1–2, 11, 18–32 ). What impresses you about the blessings the Lord promised in verses 18–32 ? Why might these blessings be especially valuable today?",
        "It might be interesting to read what Moroni said about Joel 2 when he visited Joseph Smith in 1823 (see Joseph Smith—History 1:41 ). How do you feel the prophecies in Joel 2:28–32 are being fulfilled in our day? (see also Acts 2:1–21 ). What do you think it means that the Lord would “pour out [His] spirit upon all flesh”? ( Joel 2:28 ).",
        "You might ponder these words from President Russell M. Nelson: “In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost” (“ Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 96). Why is revelation essential to your spiritual survival?",
        "What can you do if you feel like you aren’t receiving that outpouring? Here are some examples that might help. What did the people in these scriptures do to receive an outpouring of the Lord’s Spirit?",
        "As you read these words from Elder David A. Bednar, ponder what it means to you to feel an outpouring of the Holy Ghost in your daily life:",
        "“We often make it hard on ourselves to receive personal revelation. By that I mean the covenant promise is that as we honor our covenants, we may always have the Holy Ghost to be our constant companion. But we talk about it and we treat it as if hearing the voice of the Lord through His Spirit is the rare event. … [The Spirit] ought to be with us all of the time. Not every nanosecond, but if a person is doing his or her best—you don’t have to be perfect—but if you and I are doing our best and we’re not committing serious transgression, then we can count on the Holy Ghost guiding us. …",
        "“… We seem to believe that the Holy Ghost is dramatic and big and sudden, when it’s still and small and incremental over time” (“ Elder David A. Bednar Discussion ” [evening with a General Authority, Feb. 7, 2020], broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).",

The covenant, like a marriage, included eternal commitment, shared experiences, building a life together, exclusive loyalty, and, most of all, wholehearted love. Sadly, the Israelites were not faithful to their covenant. And yet the Lord’s message to them was not “I will reject you forever.” Instead it was “I will invite you back” (see\nHosea 2:14–15\n). “I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness,” He declared through the prophet Hosea (\nHosea 2:19\n). “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely” (\nHosea 14:4\n). This is the same message He gives us today as we seek to live our covenants with love and devotion.\nJoel shared a similar message: “Turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness” (\nJoel 2:13\n). Reading these prophets’ words may prompt you to ponder your own relationship with the Lord—to think about how His faithfulness to you inspires you to be faithful to Him.\nFor an overview of the books of Hosea and Joel, see “\nHosea, or Hoshea\n” and “\nJoel\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHosea 1–3\n;\n14\nThe Lord always invites me to return to Him.\nHosea’s wife, Gomer, was unfaithful to him, and God pointed to this sad event to teach the Israelites how He felt about them and their covenants with Him.

There’s nothing wrong with sailing to Tarshish, except that it is far away from Nineveh, where Jonah was supposed to go to deliver God’s message. When the ship encountered a great storm, Jonah knew it was because of his disobedience. At Jonah’s insistence, his fellow mariners cast him into the depths of the sea to stop the storm. It looked like the end of Jonah and his ministry. But the Lord hadn’t given up on Jonah—just as He hadn’t given up on the people of Nineveh, on the house of Israel, or on any of us.\nSo He keeps sending prophets—like Jonah, Amos, Obadiah, and our prophets today—with the message that if we repent, we will not be cast off forever. Of all the “secrets” God reveals (see\nAmos 3:7\n), this one is among the most precious: that because of Jesus Christ, it’s not too late to change. He still wants to help us live up to the covenants we made with Him, and He’s willing to offer us another chance.\nFor more about these books, see “\nAmos\n,” “\nObadiah\n,” and “\nJonah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAmos 3:1–8\n;\n7:10–15\nThe Lord reveals truth through His prophets.\nIn\nAmos 3:3–6\n, the prophet Amos presented examples of conclusions we can draw from signs we hear or see: when a lion roars, it must have captured prey; if a bird is caught in a trap, there must have been bait there. In\nverses 7–8\n, Amos applied this logic to prophets. What conclusions can we draw when a prophet prophesies? What else do you learn about prophets from\nAmos 7:10–15\n?\nWhat has the Lord revealed to you through His prophets?\nElder Ulisses Soares said that “having prophets is a sign of God’s love” (“\nProphets Speak by the Power of the Holy Spirit\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 99). Consider how you would complete this sentence: “I know God loves me, because He sends prophets who …” Here are some scriptures that can help:\nDeuteronomy 18:18\n;\nEzekiel 3:16–17\n;\nEphesians 4:11–14\n;\n1 Nephi 22:2\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 21:4–6\n;\n84:36–38\n;\n107:91–92\n.\nWhat would you say to someone who feels prophets are not needed today?\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nProphets,\n” Gospel Library.\nAmos 4–5\n“Seek the Lord, and ye shall live.”\nAccording to\nAmos 4:6–13\n, what had the Lord hoped would happen after the Israelites experienced trials? (see also\nHelaman 12:3\n). While your trials may not have been sent by God, how have they given you opportunities to turn to Him?\nAs you read\nAmos 5:4, 14–15\n, ponder how the Lord has been gracious to you. How has seeking Him brought you life?\nAmos 8:11–12\nThe word of the Lord can satisfy spiritual hunger and thirst.\nAs you read\nAmos 8:11–12\n, think about why famine is a good comparison for living without God’s word (see also\nJohn 6:26–35\n;\n2 Nephi 9:50–51\n;\n32:3\n;\nEnos 1:4–8\n). How do you know when you are spiritually hungry?\nThese verses could also apply to the Great Apostasy (see Topics and Questions, “\nApostasy\n,” Gospel Library). How has that spiritual “famine” affected God’s children? How has the Restoration satisfied your spiritual hunger?\nSee also “The Great Apostasy” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Great Apostasy\nObadiah 1:21\nWho are the “saviours … on mount Zion”?\nReferring to\nObadiah 1:21\n, President Gordon B. Hinckley explained that we become saviors on Mount Zion when we receive ordinances for the dead in the temple (see “\nClosing Remarks\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2004, 105). How is doing that work similar—if only in a small way—to what the Savior did for us? How has doing this work helped you feel closer to the Savior?\nSee also “\nHoly Temples on Mount Zion\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 289.\nJonah 1–4\nThe Lord is merciful to all who turn to Him.\nNineveh was an enemy of Israel known for its violence and cruelty. To Jonah, it seemed unrealistic that they were ready to repent. It might be interesting to compare Jonah’s attitude (see\nJonah 1\n;\n3–4\n) to the feelings of Alma and the sons of Mosiah (see\nMosiah 28:1–5\n;\nAlma 17:23–25\n). What do you learn from\nJonah 3\nthat inspires you to share the gospel even with people who may not seem ready to change?\nAs you read Jonah, look for examples of the Lord’s mercy. Why do you feel Jonah was “displeased” and “very angry” (\nJonah 4:1\n) when the Lord extended mercy to the people of Nineveh? What do you feel the Lord was trying to teach him in\nchapter 4\n? Ponder how you have experienced His mercy in your life. What do you learn from Jonah that can help you be more merciful?\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nAmos 3:7\nProphets are messengers of Jesus Christ.\nTo help your children understand\nAmos 3:7\n, you could whisper a simple message to one of them and ask them to share the message with the other children. How is the messenger in this activity like a prophet? Why does the Lord give us prophets?\nTo learn more about what prophets do, you and your children could review\nrecent messages from the current President of the Church\n. You could also sing a song like “\nFollow the Prophet\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 110–11). Share with each other why you choose to follow God’s prophet.\nHelp children memorize scriptures.\nElder Richard G. Scott shared: “To memorize a scripture is to forge a new friendship. It is like discovering a new individual who can help in time of need, give inspiration and comfort, and be a source of motivation for needed change” (“\nThe Power of Scripture\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 2011, 6). To help your children memorize all or part of\nAmos 3:7\n, you could write it down and repeat it together. Then you could erase or cover a few words at a time until your children can repeat the entire verse from memory.\nAmos 8:11–12\nThe Restoration of the gospel ended the famine of apostasy.\nInvite your children to pretend to be hungry as you read\nAmos 8:11–12\n. What does it feel like when we are hungry for God’s word? Maybe your children could pretend to eat as you share with each other some of your favorite scriptures.\nYou could use Guide to the Scriptures, “\nApostasy\n” (Gospel Library), or “\nAfter the New Testament\n” (in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 167–70) to help your children understand the “famine” that came from the Great Apostasy and how it ended with the Restoration. Share with each other reasons you are grateful that the Lord restored His gospel in our day.\nAfter the New Testament\nJonah 1–3\nThe Lord will help me obey Him, even when it’s hard.\nTo help your children learn the story of Jonah, you could review “\nJonah the Prophet\n” in\nOld Testament Stories\n; see also this week’s activity page). You could then ask:\nWhat happened when Jonah didn’t obey the Lord? (see\nJonah 1:4–17\n).\nWhat did Jonah do to repent? (see\nJonah 1:10–12\n;\n2:1–4, 9\n;\n3:1–4\n).\nWhat happened when Jonah did obey? (see\nJonah 3:5\n).\nJonah the Prophet\nYour children might enjoy retelling the story of Jonah or acting it out. Share with each other some experiences when the Lord wanted you to do something that was hard for you. How did He help you obey Him?\nJonah 1–4\nThe Lord is merciful to all who turn to Him.\nMaybe your children could pretend they are interviewing Jonah about his experience. What questions would they ask him? Encourage them to ask questions to find out what Jonah learned about the Lord. What might Jonah say, for example, about the Lord’s mercy? (see, for example,\nJonah 2:7–10\n;\n3:10\n;\n4:2\n).\nChrist and the Palsied Man\n, by J. Kirk Richards\nHelp your children think of examples when the Savior showed mercy to others, such as\nMark 2:3–12\n;\nLuke 23:33–34\n; and\nJohn 8:1–11\n. You and your children could search for pictures of these examples. What opportunities do we have to be merciful to others?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nJonah and the Whale\n, by Kevin Carden\nOpen PDF"

The Lord frequently called prophets to warn the wicked about His judgments. The ministries of Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah are good examples. In dreadful detail, these prophets foretold the downfall of cities that, at the time, seemed strong and powerful: Nineveh, Babylon, and Jerusalem. But that was thousands of years ago. Why is it valuable to read these prophecies today?\nEven though those prideful, wicked cities were destroyed, prideful wickedness persists. We may even detect traces of it in our own hearts. Old Testament prophets reveal how we can turn away from these evils. Perhaps that’s one reason we still read their words today. They weren’t just prophets of doom—they were prophets of deliverance. The descriptions of destruction are tempered by invitations to come unto Christ and receive His forgiveness. As Micah put it, the Lord does not delight in condemning us, but “he delighteth in mercy” (\nMicah 7:18\n). This was the Lord’s way anciently, and it is His way today. “His ways are everlasting” (\nHabakkuk 3:6\n).\nFor overviews of these books, see “\nMicah\n,” “\nNahum\n,” “\nHabakkuk\n,” and “\nZephaniah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMicah 6:1–8\n“What doth the Lord require of thee?”\nMicah invites us to imagine what it might be like to “come before the Lord, and bow … before the high God” (\nMicah 6:6\n). What do\nverses 6–8\nsuggest to you about what is important to the Lord as He evaluates your life?\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nDo Justly, Love Mercy, and Walk Humbly with God\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 109–12.\n“The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble” (\nNahum 1:7\n).\nNahum 1\nThe Lord is both powerful and merciful.\nNahum’s mission was to foretell the destruction of Nineveh—the capital of the violent empire Assyria, which had scattered Israel and brutalized Judah. Nahum began by describing God’s wrath and matchless power, but He also spoke about God’s mercy and goodness. Look for verses in\nchapter 1\nthat help you understand each of these attributes—and other attributes of God that you notice. Why do you think it is important to know each of these things about the Lord?\nHabakkuk\nI can trust the Lord’s will and His timing.\nEven prophets sometimes have questions about the Lord’s ways. Habakkuk, who lived at a time of widespread wickedness in Judah, began his record with questions to the Lord (see\nHabakkuk 1:1–4\n). How would you summarize Habakkuk’s concerns? What similar questions do people ask about God today? Have you ever had similar feelings? You could also compare his questions with others in the scriptures, such as those found in\nMark 4:37–38\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:1–6\n.\nThe Lord responded to Habakkuk’s questions by saying that He would send the Chaldeans (the Babylonians) to punish Judah (see\nHabakkuk 1:5–11\n). But Habakkuk was still troubled, for it seemed unfair for the Lord to stand by “when the wicked [Babylon] devoureth the man that is more righteous [Judah]” (see\nverses 12–17\n). What do you find in\nHabakkuk 2:1–4\nthat inspires you to trust the Lord when you have unanswered questions? (see also\nMark 4:39–40\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:7–8\n; “God Will Lift Us Up” [video], Gospel Library).\nGod Will Lift Us Up\nChapter 3\nis Habakkuk’s prayer of praise and faith. How is Habakkuk’s tone in\nchapter 3\ndifferent from\nchapter 1\n? Here’s an idea to help you ponder\nverses 17–19\n: Make a list of temporal and spiritual blessings God has given you. Then imagine that you lost the temporal blessings. How might that make you feel about the other blessings? Why might it be hard to “rejoice in the Lord” (\nverse 18\n) during hardships like those described in\nverse 17\n? Ponder how you can develop greater faith in God, even when life seems unfair.\nSee also Gerrit W. Gong, “\nAll Things for Our Good\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 41–44; “\nLead, Kindly Light\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 97; Topics and Questions, “\nSeeking Answers to Questions\n,” Gospel Library.\nBe patient.\nSometimes we want answers to our questions right away, but spiritual insights take time and cannot be forced. As the Lord told Habakkuk, “Wait for it; because it will surely come” (\nHabakkuk 2:3\n).\nZephaniah\n“Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth.”\nAs you read Zephaniah’s prophecies, notice the attitudes and behaviors that led to destruction—see especially\nZephaniah 1:4–6, 12\n;\n2:8, 10, 15\n;\n3:1–4\n. Then look for the characteristics of the people God would preserve—see\nZephaniah 2:1–3\n;\n3:12–13, 18–19\n. What message do you feel the Lord has for you in these verses?\nZephaniah 3:14–20\nThe Lord will rejoice with His people in Zion.\nAfter reading\nZephaniah 3:14–20\n, see how many ways you can complete this sentence:\n“Be glad and rejoice with all the heart” because …\nWhy is it important to you to know about these reasons to rejoice? You might compare these verses to the experiences described in\n3 Nephi 17\nand ponder how Jesus Christ feels about His people—including you.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMicah 5:2\nJesus Christ was born in Bethlehem.\nYour children may not know that it was a prophecy by Micah that helped the Wise Men find the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. Using\nMicah 5:2\nand\nMatthew 2:1–6\n, perhaps your children could reenact their experience. Then you could talk about why Jesus’s birth was so important that prophets knew about it many years before He was born.\nThe Holy Child Is Born\n, by Dana Wood\nNahum 1:7\n“The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble.”\nAfter reading\nNahum 1:7\n, your children could build or draw a simple “strong hold” or fortress (there’s a picture of one in this outline). What are some reasons people might need a fortress? What makes our day a “day of trouble”? How is Jesus Christ like a stronghold for us?\nHabakkuk 2:3\nGod will always fulfill His promises.\nTo introduce\nHabakkuk 2:3\n, you and your children could talk about things that are good but only after we wait—like fruit that needs to ripen or dough that needs to bake. What would happen if we tried to eat the fruit or the dough before it was ready? Then you could talk about the prophet Habakkuk, who wanted to know when the Lord would stop the wickedness in the world. Read the Lord’s answer in\nHabakkuk 2:3\n. You could help your children think of things that God has promised. With each example, you could say together, “Wait for it; because it will surely come.”\nHabakkuk 2:14\nI can help fill the earth with knowledge of Jesus Christ.\nTo illustrate\nHabakkuk 2:14\n, you and your children could fill a jar or other container with pictures or words representing things Jesus did or taught. How can we help fill the world with knowledge of the Lord?\nYou could also show your children a map of the world (see Church History Maps, no. 7, “\nMap of the World\n”). Help them find the place where they live and places where missionaries they know have served. You could sing together a song about sharing the gospel, such as “\nWe’ll Bring the World His Truth\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 172–73). What can we tell others about Jesus Christ?\nZephaniah 3:14–20\nJesus Christ rejoices with those who follow Him.\nIn\nZephaniah 3:14–20\n, your children could look for something that makes them want to “sing, … be glad and rejoice with all the heart.” Perhaps you could sing some joyful hymns or songs together and talk about the joy you find in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nAnd He Took Their Little Children One by One\n, by Casey Childs\nOpen PDF"

      "plain_text": "“December 7–13. ‘Holiness unto the Lord”: Haggai 1–2; Zechariah 1–4; 7–14,’\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“December 7–13. ‘Holiness unto the Lord,’”\nCome, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\nLaie Hawaii Temple\nDecember 7–13: “Holiness unto the Lord”\nHaggai 1–2\n;\nZechariah 1–4\n;\n7–14\nAfter decades of captivity, a group of Israelites, probably including the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, were allowed to return to Jerusalem. Some in this group remembered what the temple looked like before it was destroyed. To those who wondered whether it would ever again resemble the Lord’s “house in her first glory” (\nHaggai 2:3\n), Haggai spoke the Lord’s words of encouragement: “Be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, … fear ye not.” “I will fill this house with glory, … and in this place will I give peace” (\nHaggai 2:4–5, 7, 9\n).\nBut it wasn’t just the holy temple that needed rebuilding. In many ways, God’s people were spiritually in ruins. And rebuilding a holy people takes more than cutting stones and positioning them to build a holy house. It means the inscription “Holiness unto the Lord” must be engraved not just on a temple wall, or even on “the bells of the horses” and “every pot in Jerusalem” (\nZechariah 14:20–21\n). They must also be engraved on every heart.\nFor an overview of the books of Haggai and Zechariah, see “\nHaggai\n” and “\nZechariah\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHaggai 1\n;\n2:1–9\n“Consider your ways.”\nThere were many important things to do to rebuild Jerusalem. But after roughly 15 years had passed since the Israelites’ return, the Lord was displeased that the rebuilding of the temple had not been given higher priority (see\nHaggai 1:2–5\n; see also\nEzra 4:24\n). As you read\nHaggai 1\n;\n2:1–9\n, consider questions like these:\nWhat consequences did the Israelites face because they had not finished the temple?\nWhat blessings did the Lord promise them if they finished building His house?\nWhat is the Lord’s message to you in\nHaggai 1:5–7\n? How could you align your priorities with the Lord’s? When have you been blessed for putting God first in your life?\nThe early Latter-day Saints faced a similar situation to the Israelites in Haggai’s day (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 95\n). What do you learn from these two examples about the Lord’s feelings about temples?\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nJesus Christ Is the Treasure\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 96–99; Terence M. Vinson, “\nTrue Disciples of the Savior\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 9–11; “\nWe Love Thy House, O God\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 247; “Provo City Center Temple Completed” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nProvo City Center Temple Completed\nZechariah 1–3\n;\n7–8\n;\n14\nThe Lord can make me holy.\nIn your opinion, what’s the value of having “holiness unto the Lord” engraved on everyday objects like those mentioned in\nZechariah 14:20\n? (see also\nExodus 28:36–38\n). What’s the value of having it engraved on temples today? What does this phrase mean to you? How can you make holiness part of your daily life? Ponder these questions as you read the Lord’s invitations to His people to become more holy in\nZechariah 1:1–6\n;\n3:1–7\n;\n7:8–10\n;\n8:16–17\n.\nYou could also read\nZechariah 2:10–11\n;\n8:1–8\n;\n14:9–11, 20–21\nto learn what life will be like in a future day when we all dwell with the Lord in a state of holiness. What impresses you about Zechariah’s vision of the future of Jerusalem? What do you find here that you would like to see in your community? How can you prepare to live in the conditions Zechariah described?\n“Behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass” (\nZechariah 9:9\n).\nTriumphal Entry\n, by Harry Anderson\nZechariah 9:9–11\n;\n11:12–13\n;\n12:10\n;\n13:6–7\n;\n14:1–9\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nSeveral of Zechariah’s writings point both to the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ and to His eventual Second Coming. Below are some of Zechariah’s prophecies, along with scriptures about their fulfillment. As you study these passages, ask yourself: What does this teach me about the Savior?\nZechariah 9:9–11\n(see\nMatthew 21:1–11\n;\n1 Peter 3:18–19\n)\nZechariah 11:12–13\n(see\nMatthew 26:14–16\n;\n27:1–7\n)\nZechariah 12:10\n(see\nJohn 19:37\n;\nRevelation 1:7\n)\nZechariah 13:6–7\n;\n14:1–9\n(see\nMatthew 26:31\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 45:47–53\n)\nWhat do you think it would have been like to be among the people welcoming Jesus into Jerusalem as described in\nZechariah 9:9–11\n? How can you welcome Him into your life, your homes, and your community?\nSee also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nMessiah\n,” Gospel Library; “The Lord’s Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem” (video), Gospel Library; Ronald A. Rasband, “\nHosanna to the Most High God\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 108–12.\nThe Lord's Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nHaggai 1:2–8\n“Consider your ways.”\nAs you read parts of\nHaggai 1:2–5\nwith your children, help them find out why the Lord was not pleased with the people. Perhaps your children could pick a phrase from\nverse 6\nand draw a picture of it. They could show it to each other and guess what phrase each drawing represents. When we spend time on things other than what the Lord wants, how is that like eating but not being filled? You might talk with each other about how you can make time for the things that are important to the Lord.\nYou could also read\nverse 8\nto your children and invite them to pretend to “go up to the mountain,” “bring wood,” and “build the house [of the Lord].” Your children could make a list of things they do in a typical day, including things the Lord has asked them to do. Ask your children to “consider [their] ways” by circling what the Lord might say are the most important things on their list.\nHome-centered teaching.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson has taught that the home should be the “center of gospel learning” (“\nBecoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 113). As your family studies Haggai’s counsel to “consider your ways,” you could talk about how to put God first in your family life.\nZechariah 3:1–7\nMaking and keeping covenants can help me be more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nIn a vision, Zechariah saw a high priest who was “clothed with filthy garments” (\nZechariah 3:3\n). An angel gave him clean clothing. You could help your children discover important truths by reading together\nZechariah 3:1–7\nand talking about what the dirty clothing and clean clothing might represent. How do we become clean from our sins, even after we are baptized? How does our baptismal covenant help us “walk in [the Lord’s] ways”?\nYou and your children could look at a picture of a baptism, like the one in this outline. Why do we wear white at our baptism? You could also sing a song about baptism, such as “\nWhen I Am Baptized\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 103); what does the song teach about why the Lord wants us to be baptized?\nZechariah 9:9–11\n;\n11:12\n;\n13:6–7\nJesus Christ is the promised Messiah.\nYour children might like to visualize the event foretold in\nZechariah 9:9\n, when Jesus came into Jerusalem during the last week of His mortal life. To help with this, show them a picture of the event, like the one in this outline. You could also share with them “\nThe Savior Goes to Jerusalem\n” (in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 110–12). Your children could point to people in the pictures who are “rejoicing greatly.” Who is the King in\nZechariah 9:9\n? Why are we thankful for Him?\nChapter 44: The Savior Goes to Jerusalem\nConsider helping your children compare prophecies from Zechariah with the New Testament verses describing their fulfillment. Here are some examples:\nZechariah 9:9\nand\nMatthew 21:5–9\n;\nZechariah 9:11\nand\n1 Peter 3:18–19\n;\nZechariah 11:12\nand\nMatthew 26:14–16\n;\nZechariah 13:7\nand\nMatthew 26:31\n. What do we learn about the Savior from these verses?\nFor more, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\n“Holiness to the Lord” appears on every temple.\nOpen PDF"

      "plain_text": "“December 14–20. ‘I Have Loved You, Saith the Lord’: Malachi,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“December 14–20. ‘I Have Loved You, Saith the Lord,’”\nCome, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\nDecember 14–20: “I Have Loved You, Saith the Lord”\nMalachi\n“I have loved you,” the Lord told His people through the prophet Malachi. But the Israelites, who had suffered generations of affliction and captivity, asked, “Wherein hast thou loved us?” (\nMalachi 1:2\n). After all Israel had been through, they may have wondered whether their history is really a story of God’s love for His covenant people. In some ways, it’s easier to see it as a story of human weakness and rebellion. Yet through it all, God never stopped reaching out in love. When the sons of Jacob mistreated their brother Joseph, the Lord still saved them from famine (see\nGenesis 45:4–8\n). When Israel murmured in the wilderness, He fed them with manna (see\nExodus 16:1–4\n). Even when Israel turned to other gods and were scattered, God promised that if they repented, He would gather and redeem them “with great mercies” (see\nIsaiah 54:7\n). Truly, the Old Testament is a story of God’s patient, enduring love. And this story continues today. Jesus Christ, “the Sun of Righteousness,” as Malachi called Him, has come “with healing in his wings” (\nMalachi 4:2\n). He is the greatest evidence of God’s love for ancient Israel and for all of us.\nFor more information about the book of Malachi, see “\nMalachi\n” in the Bible Dictionary.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMalachi 1–4\n“Return unto me, and I will return unto you.”\nIn Malachi’s day, the Israelites had already rebuilt the temple in Jerusalem, but as a people they still needed to rebuild their relationship with the Lord. As you study Malachi, look for questions that the Lord asked the Israelites or that they asked Him. Consider asking yourself similar questions (some examples are suggested below) to help you evaluate your relationship with the Lord and draw closer to Him.\nHow have I felt the Lord’s love for me? (see\nMalachi 1:2\n).\nDo my offerings to the Lord truly honor Him? (see\nMalachi 1:6–11\n)\nIn what ways do I need to “return” to the Lord? (see\nMalachi 3:7\n).\nAm I robbing God in any way? (see\nMalachi 3:8–11\n).\nHow does my attitude during difficult times reflect my feelings toward the Lord? (see\nMalachi 3:13–15\n; see also\n2:17\n).\nMalachi 1:6–14\nThe Lord asks for “a pure offering.”\nAs you read about the offerings described in\nMalachi 1\n, what do you notice about the sacrifices the priests were offering? What do these sacrifices suggest about the priests’ feelings toward the Lord? (see\nMalachi 1:13\n). Consider making a list of offerings, or sacrifices, that you make to the Lord. For each item on the list, ponder what might make it a “polluted” offering or a “pure” offering (\nMalachi 1:7, 11\n).\nMalachi 3:8–12\nThe Lord opens the windows of heaven as I show my faith by paying tithing.\nImagine you have a friend who just found out that you pay tithing. “Why do you do that?” your friend asks. Think about this as you read\nMalachi 3:8–12\n. What do you find there that could help answer your friend’s question? What else would you want your friend to understand about tithing? For more help, you could search Elder Neil L. Andersen’s message “\nTithing: Opening the Windows of Heaven\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 32–35), looking for answers to questions like these:\nWhy does the Lord want us to pay tithing?\nWhat might keep someone from paying tithing, and how can we overcome those obstacles?\nHow does paying tithing strengthen our faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?\nYou could also share with your friend how the Lord has blessed you when you pay tithing. You can find ideas in the section titled “\nLesson Number 1—Significant but Subtle Blessings\n” in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nThe Windows of Heaven\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 17–18). What kind of people do we become by paying tithing?\nWhat do you think the phrase “open you the windows of heaven” (\nverse 10\n) might mean? Maybe you could look out a window and think about the purposes of windows. Why is “windows of heaven” a good way to describe how the Lord blesses us when we pay tithing?\nVision in the Kirtland Temple\n, by Gary Smith\nMalachi 4:5–6\n“I will send you Elijah the prophet.”\nWhen Moroni quoted\nMalachi 4:5–6\nto Joseph Smith, he did so “with a little variation from the way it reads” in the Bible (see\nJoseph Smith—History 1:36–39\n). What does Moroni’s variation add to your understanding of this prophecy? In particular, ponder questions like these:\nWho are “the fathers”? (see\nDeuteronomy 29:13\n). What promises have been made to them? (see\nAbraham 2:9–11\n). How do you help fulfill these promises?\nWhat experiences have helped you turn your heart to your ancestors? Why is that so important to Heavenly Father’s plan?\nTo learn more about the coming of Elijah and how this prophecy is being fulfilled today, see\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:13–16\nand D. Todd Christofferson, “\nThe Sealing Power\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 19–22). Why are you grateful that Elijah has come?\nSee also Gerrit W. Gong, “\nWe Each Have a Story\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 43–46; “\nTurn Your Hearts\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 291; “The Sealing Power” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe Sealing Power\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMalachi 1:2\nThe Lord loves me.\nHow would you and your children answer the question in\nMalachi 1:2\n—“Wherein hast [the Lord] loved us?” Share with each other reasons you know He loves you. Maybe your children could draw pictures that remind them of His love.\nEngage children in gospel discussions.\nIf you are teaching younger children, you may need to think of creative ways to involve them in gospel discussions. For example, your children could pass around a ball; when they are holding the ball, they could share one reason they know Jesus loves them.\nMalachi 3:8–12\nThe Lord will bless me as I pay tithing.\nHow will you help your children learn about tithing? You could ask them to count 10 small objects, such as the coins on this week’s activity page. Then they could separate one of the objects from the rest—this is how much we give to the Lord as tithing. According to\nMalachi 3:8–12\n, why does the Lord want us to pay tithing?

      "plain_text": "“December 21–27. ‘We Have Waited for Him, and He Will Save Us’: Christmas,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Old Testament 2026\n(2026)\n“December 21–27. ‘We Have Waited for Him, and He Will Save Us,’”\nCome, Follow Me: Old Testament 2026\nFor unto Us a Child Is Born\n, by Simon Dewey\nDecember 21–27: “We Have Waited for Him, and He Will Save Us”\nChristmas\nThe Old Testament carries a spirit of eager anticipation. In that way, it’s a little bit like the Christmas season. Beginning with Adam and Eve, Old Testament patriarchs, prophets, poets, and people looked forward to better days, filled with hope for the Messiah’s renewal and deliverance. And the Israelites were frequently in need of that hope—whether they were in captivity in Egypt or Babylon or held captive by their own sin or rebellion. Through it all, prophets reminded them that a Messiah, a Deliverer, would come “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (\nIsaiah 61:1\n).\nThat hope began to be realized when Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem. The mighty Deliverer of Israel was born in a stable and laid in a manger (see\nLuke 2:7\n). But He wasn’t just the Deliverer of the ancient Israelites. He came to deliver you—to bear your grief, to carry your sorrows, to be bruised for your iniquities, so that with His stripes you can be healed (see\nIsaiah 53:4–5\n). This is why Christmas is so full of joyful anticipation even today. The Messiah came over 2,000 years ago, and He continues to come into our lives whenever we seek Him.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nI rejoice in my Redeemer.\nChristmas is known as a joyful season because of the joy that Jesus Christ brings to the world. Centuries before the Savior was born, Old Testament prophets also felt joy as they spoke of the coming Messiah. Read some of the following passages, and think about why they would have been precious to people who looked forward to the Savior’s mission:\nPsalm 35:9\n;\nIsaiah 25:8–9\n;\n44:21–24\n;\n51:11\n;\nZephaniah 3:14–20\n;\nMoses 5:5–11\n. Why are these passages precious to you? What reasons do these scripture passages give to be joyful?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nGood Tidings of Great Joy\n” (First Presidency Christmas devotional, Dec. 4, 2022), Gospel Library; “\nJoy to the World\n,”\nHymns\n, no 201.\nSymbols can help me remember Jesus Christ.\nMany of the traditions associated with Christmas can have symbolic meanings that point us to Christ. As you studied the Old Testament this year, you may have noticed many symbols of the Savior. A few are listed below. Consider studying these and recording what they teach you about Him.\nStar\n(\nNumbers 24:17\n;\nMatthew 2:2\n;\nRevelation 22:16\n).\nShepherd\n(\nPsalm 23\n;\nLuke 15:4–7\n;\nJohn 10:11\n)\nLamb\n(\nGenesis 22:8\n;\nExodus 12:5\n;\n1 Peter 1:18–20\n).\nWater\n(\nExodus 17:1–6\n;\nJeremiah 2:13\n;\nEzekiel 47:1–12\n;\nJohn 4:7–14\n).\nRock\n(\n1 Samuel 2:2\n;\n2 Samuel 22:2–3\n;\nPsalm 118:22–23\n;\nIsaiah 28:16\n;\nEphesians 2:20\n).\nBranch\n(\nIsaiah 11:1–2\n;\nJeremiah 23:5\n;\n33:15\n).\nLight\n(\nPsalm 27:1\n;\nIsaiah 9:2\n;\n60:19\n;\nMicah 7:8\n;\nJohn 8:12\n).\nWhat other symbols, passages, and accounts have you found in the scriptures that testify of Jesus Christ?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 11:4\n;\nMosiah 3:14–15\n;\nMoses 6:63\n; “\nTypes or Symbols of Christ\n” and “\nJesus Christ\n,” both in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).\n“His name shall be called Wonderful.”\nJesus Christ is referred to by many different names and titles. Look for titles in the following verses:\nPsalms 23:1\n;\n83:18\n;\nIsaiah 7:14\n;\n9:6\n;\n12:2\n;\n63:16\n;\nAmos 4:13\n;\nZechariah 14:16\n;\nMoses 7:53\n. What other titles can you think of? You might even enjoy listing titles of Jesus Christ that you find in Christmas hymns. How does each title influence the way you think about Him?\nConsider choosing a title or role of the Savior that will help you remember Him throughout the coming year.\nSee also Quentin L. Cook, “\nPersonal Peace in Challenging Times\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 89–92; “\nHark! The Herald Angels Sing\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 209.\nFor more, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nThe Old Testament teaches me about Jesus.\nYou and your children might have some Christmas decorations you can use to start a conversation about Jesus Christ. Maybe you could talk about how a Christmas star, lights, or a gift reminds us of the Savior. Then you could look in one or more of the following scriptures for something that could symbolize Jesus Christ:\nGenesis 22:8\n;\nNumbers 24:17\n;\nPsalms 23:1\n;\n27:1\n. Maybe your children could hold up a picture or decoration that goes with each verse as they read it. How is Jesus like a lamb, star, shepherd, or light? Consider singing a Christmas song together, like “\nStars Were Gleaming\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 37).\nYour children could also look at the picture at the end of this outline as you read\nIsaiah 9:6\nto them. Ask your children to point to the baby Jesus when they hear the phrase “a child is born.” Share your testimony that prophets in the Old Testament knew that Jesus would be born.\nAs you prepare to study the life of Jesus Christ in the New Testament next year, consider reviewing with your children what they have learned about Him this year in the Old Testament. You might review the outlines in this resource and any personal study notes to help you remember what you’ve learned. Younger children might benefit from looking through\nOld Testament Stories\nor the pictures in\nCome, Follow Me\n. What prophecies or stories stood out? What have we learned about the Savior?\nChristmas traditions can point to Jesus Christ.\nIsraelite families had traditions, such as the Passover and other feasts, that were meant to point their hearts and minds to the Lord (see\nExodus 12\n). What traditions do you and your children have at Christmastime that help you focus on Jesus Christ? What traditions do you know about from your family history?

This includes helping them prepare to make and keep sacred covenants, such as the covenant of baptism and the covenants made in the temple. Through these covenants, your children will be able to joyfully bind themselves to the Savior, Jesus Christ.\nThere are many ways to prepare your children for this journey on the covenant path, and Heavenly Father will help you discover the best way to help them. As you seek inspiration, keep in mind that not all learning happens during scheduled lessons. In fact, part of what makes learning at home so powerful is the opportunity to learn by example and through small, simple teaching moments—the kind that occur naturally in the flow of daily living. Just as following the covenant path is a consistent, lifelong process, so is learning about the covenant path. (See “\nHome and Family\n,”\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n[2022], 30–31.)\nBelow are some ideas that may lead to further inspiration. You can find additional ideas for teaching Primary-age children in “\nAppendix B: For Primary—Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nBaptism and Confirmation\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] should enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” (\n2 Nephi 31:17\n). Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenant by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] should enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” (\n2 Nephi 31:17\n).\nHere are some resources that can help you:\n2 Nephi 31\n;\nspecial issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine\nabout baptism; Topics and Questions, “\nBaptism\n,” Gospel Library.\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child. Help them understand that faith is something that can grow stronger and stronger throughout life. What are some things your child can do to develop stronger faith in Christ before they are baptized?\nWhen your child makes a wrong choice, speak joyfully about the gift of repentance. And when you make a wrong choice, share the joy that comes when you repent of your sins each day. Testify that because Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, we can repent daily, be forgiven, and receive the power to change. When your child seeks your forgiveness, forgive freely and joyfully.\nTell your child about your baptism. Show pictures and share memories. Talk about how you felt, how keeping your baptismal covenant has helped you come to know Jesus Christ better, and how your covenants continue to bless your life. Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like these: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something they promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (See\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n.)\nTalk about how being confirmed and becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has blessed you. For example, how have you come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you have served others and as others have served you? Help your child think of ways to serve and strengthen others as a member of the Church. Also help them experience and recognize the joy that comes from service.\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell them about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have. Invite your child to share how they feel. Note the variety of ways the Spirit can speak to people, including ways He speaks to you personally. Help your child recognize and share with you moments when they may be experiencing the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nWatch together a few of the videos in the Gospel Library collection titled “\nHear Him!\n” Talk together about the different ways the Lord’s servants hear His voice. Invite your child to draw a picture or make a video about how they hear the Savior’s voice.\nMake the sacrament a sacred and joyful event in your family. Share with your child how you focus on Jesus Christ during the sacrament. Help your child make a plan to show that the sacrament is sacred to them. For example, listening to the words of the sacrament prayers can remind us of our baptismal covenant.\nMany issues of the\nFriend\nmagazine include articles, stories, and activities to help children prepare for baptism and confirmation. Let your child choose some to read and enjoy with you. (See also the collection “\nPreparing for Baptism\n” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library.)\nPriesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nThe priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “All Church members who keep their covenants—women, men, and children—are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families” (\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n3.6\n, Gospel Library). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n2.2\n).\nWhen men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. All of Heavenly Father’s children—His sons and His daughters—will be blessed as they come to better understand His priesthood.\nWe receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. “Worthy male Church members receive priesthood authority through priesthood conferral and ordination to priesthood offices” (\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.4\n). Those who hold priesthood offices can be authorized by someone who holds priesthood keys to perform priesthood ordinances.\nTo learn more about the priesthood, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Price of Priesthood Power\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 66–69; “\nPriesthood Principles\n,”\nchapter 3\nin\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nMake priesthood ordinances a consistent part of your family life. For example, help your child prepare spiritually for the sacrament each week. Encourage your child to seek priesthood blessings when they are sick or need comfort or direction. Make it a habit to point out ways the Lord is blessing your family through His power.\nAs you read the scriptures together, watch for opportunities to discuss how God blesses people through His power. Share your own experiences when God has blessed you through His priesthood. For examples of blessings we receive from God through the priesthood, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.2\n,\n3.5\n.\nTeach your child that after baptism, they can receive God’s power by keeping the baptismal covenant. Review together President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nSpiritual Treasures\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79). Tell your child how priesthood ordinances have brought God’s power into your life. For a list of some of the ways we are blessed by God’s power, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.5\n.\nDiscuss the question “What is a servant of the Lord like?” Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:36–42\n, and look for answers. Whenever you notice your child (or someone else) applying one of the principles or attributes in these verses, point it out.\nWhen you or your child uses keys to unlock a door or start a car, take a moment to compare those keys to the keys that priesthood leaders hold. (For a definition of priesthood keys, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.4.1\n). What do priesthood keys “unlock” or “start” for us? See also Gary E. Stevenson, “\nWhere Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 29–32; “Where Are the Keys?” (video), Gospel Library.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nBeing Baptized and Confirmed for Ancestors\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In the house of the Lord, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including people who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year your child turns 12, they are old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors (see also\n1 Corinthians 15:29\n).\nGo to the house of the Lord as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the temple recommend questions together. You can find them on\npages 36–37\nof\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n. Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together\nMalachi 4:6\n. Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on\nFamilySearch.org\n. Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “\nTemple\n” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “\nPreparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations\n” on ChurchofJesusChrist.org.)\nReceiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel to us from Heavenly Father and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching them the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Topics and Questions, “\nPatriarchal Blessings\n,” Gospel Library.\nShare with your child your experience receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how He continues to guide you through this blessing. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nReview together Elder Randall K. Bennett’s message “\nYour Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father\n” and Elder Kazuhiko Yamashita’s message “\nWhen to Receive Your Patriarchal Blessing\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2023, 42–43, 88–90). Share with each other what you learn from these messages about why Heavenly Father wants us to receive a patriarchal blessing. To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n18.17\n.\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, click\nTools\nat the top right corner of the screen, and select\nPatriarchal Blessing\n.\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and share them with your child.\nReceiving the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8\n). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the house of the Lord. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there. Look for opportunities to go to the temple with your child to perform baptisms and confirmations for their ancestors.\nExplore\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\ntogether. Read articles like “\nAbout the Temple Endowment\n” and “\nPrepare for the House of the Lord\n.” Let your child ask any questions they have about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nPrepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “\nHome-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation\n”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how they are keeping the baptismal covenant described in\nMosiah 18:10, 13\n(see also\nverses 8–9\n, which describe the fruits of that covenant).

Build your child’s confidence in their ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ.

Dennis, “\nPut Ye On the Lord Jesus Christ\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2024, 10–13).\nSacred Temple Clothing\nServing a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to become a missionary long before you go on a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“\nBecoming a Missionary\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2005, 45–46).

Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive from the Savior’s restored gospel and as a member of His Church. Invite others to join your family in Church- and family-related activities.\nLook for opportunities for your family to interact with missionaries.

This occurs in an ordinance called “the temple sealing.” Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your daughter or son, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help them prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nRead together “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” (Gospel Library).

There are more covenants to make after baptism, including covenants made in the temple. Explain that President Nelson has called this path the “covenant path.”"

He said that we can enter the kingdom of God if we have faith, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end (see\n3 Nephi 11:31–40\n; see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:29\n). The activities below can help you teach the children that these principles and ordinances will help us draw closer to the Savior throughout our lives.\nTo learn more about the doctrine of Christ, see\n2 Nephi 31\n.\nPossible Activities\nGive the children pictures that represent faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and confirmation (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n1\n,\n111\n,\n103\n, and\n105\n). Read or recite with the children the\nfourth article of faith\n, and ask them to hold up their pictures when that principle or ordinance is mentioned. Help the children understand how each of these principles and ordinances helps us become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nHow can you help the children understand that faith, repentance, baptism, and confirmation are not one-time events but influence our spiritual growth throughout our lives? You could show them a picture of a seed and a large tree (or draw these things on the board). Help them think of things that help the seed grow into a large tree, such as water, soil, and sunlight. Help them see that these are like the things we do to grow closer to God throughout our lives—building our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting each day, living our baptismal covenant, partaking of the sacrament, and receiving the Holy Ghost.\nShare with the children the story about the firecracker from Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “\nHow Can Repenting Help Me Feel Happy?\n” (\nFriend\n, Dec. 2017, 12–13, or\nLiahona\n, Dec. 2017, 70–71; see also the video “Repentance: A Joyful Choice” [Gospel Library]). At various points during the story, invite the children to think about how Elder Renlund might have felt. Why do we feel joy when we repent? Share with the children the joy and love you have felt when you asked Heavenly Father to forgive you.\nRepentance: A Joyful Choice\nBaptism\nJesus Christ set an example for me when He was baptized.\nEven though Jesus was without sin, He was baptized to set a perfect example of obedience to Heavenly Father (see\n2 Nephi 31:6–10\n).\nTo learn more about baptism, see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n; Topics and Questions, “\nBaptism\n,” Gospel Library.\nPossible Activities\nShow a picture of the Savior’s baptism and another person’s baptism (or see\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n35\nand either no.\n103\nor no.\n104\n). Ask the children to share what is different and what is the same between the two pictures. Read together\nMatthew 3:13–17\nor “\nChapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized\n” in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 26–29. Let the children point to things in the pictures that they hear in these stories. Tell the children about your love for the Savior and your desire to follow Him.\nChapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized\nListen to or sing a song about baptism, such as “\nWhen Jesus Christ Was Baptized\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 102). What do we learn about baptism from the song? Read\n2 Nephi 31:9–10\n, and invite the children to listen for why Jesus Christ was baptized. Invite them to draw a picture of themselves on their baptism day.\nI can choose to make a covenant with God and be baptized.\nPreparing for baptism means much more than preparing for an event. It means preparing to make a covenant and then keeping that covenant for a lifetime. Ponder how you can help the children understand the covenant they will make with Heavenly Father when they are baptized, which includes the promises He makes to them and the promises they make to Him.\nPossible Activities\nExplain that a covenant is a promise between a person and Heavenly Father. As we strive to keep our promises to God, God promises to bless us. Write on the board\nMy Promises to God\nand\nGod’s Promises to Me\n. Read together\nMosiah 18:10, 13\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n, and help the children make a list of the promises they find under the appropriate headings (see also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nYour Baptism Covenant\n,”\nFriend\n, Feb. 2021, 2–3). Share how Heavenly Father has blessed you as you strive to keep your baptismal covenant.\nShow the children pictures of things Jesus Christ did during His ministry (for some examples, see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 33–49\n). Let the children talk about what Jesus is doing in each picture. Read\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n, and invite the children to listen for ways they can keep the covenant of baptism (see also “\nMy Baptismal Covenant\n,”\nLiahona\n, Aug. 2023, 10–11). How can the baptismal covenant influence our actions every day? Invite the children to draw a picture of themselves helping someone the way Jesus would.\nConfirmation\nWhen I am baptized and confirmed, I become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nBecoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints brings many blessings, including opportunities for the children to be active participants in God’s work.\nPossible Activities\nInvite someone who was recently baptized and confirmed to come to class and share what it was like to be confirmed. Ask this person to talk about what it means to him or her to become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Help the children think of ways they can keep their baptismal covenant as members of the Church. Share how doing these things has helped you feel the joy of being a member of Christ’s Church.\nShow a picture of the people at the Waters of Mormon (see\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n76\n), and ask the children to describe what they see in the picture. Tell the story of Alma and his people being baptized there (see\nMosiah 18:1–17\n; “\nAlma at the Waters of Mormon\n,” in\nBook of Mormon Stories\n). Review\nMosiah 18:8–9\nand invite the children to do actions to help them remember the things the people were willing to do as members of Christ’s Church. Share an experience when you have witnessed members of the Church serving in these ways.\nAlma at the Waters of Mormon\nWhen I am confirmed, I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nWhen we are baptized and confirmed, Heavenly Father promises that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77\n). This wonderful gift from God is called the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nTo learn more about the gift of the Holy Ghost, see Gary E. Stevenson, “\nPromptings of the Spirit\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2023, 42–45; Topics and Questions, “\nGift of the Holy Ghost\n,” Gospel Library.\nPossible Activities\nRead\nDoctrine and Covenants 33:15\n, and ask the children to listen for the special gift that Heavenly Father gives us when we are baptized and confirmed. To help them learn more about how the gift of the Holy Ghost will help them, review together\nJohn 14:26\n;\nGalatians 5:22–23\n;\n2 Nephi 32:5\n;\n3 Nephi 27:20\n. You could also review the article “\nA Special Gift\n” (\nLiahona\n, Aug. 2023, 18–19).\nBefore class, ask the parents of one or more of the children to share how they have been blessed because they have the gift of the Holy Ghost. How does He help them? How do they hear His voice?\nSing together a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “\nThe Holy Ghost\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 105). Help the children understand what the song teaches us about how the Holy Ghost can help us.\nThe Holy Ghost can speak to me in many ways.\nChildren who can recognize the voice of the Spirit will be prepared to receive personal revelation to guide them throughout their lives. Help them understand that there are many ways the Holy Ghost can speak to us.\nPossible Activities\nHelp the children think of different ways we could talk to a friend who lives far away, such as writing a letter, sending an email, or talking on the phone. Teach them that Heavenly Father can speak to us in different ways through the Holy Ghost. Use President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “\nHow Does Heavenly Father Speak to Us?\n” to help the children understand the different ways the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds and hearts (\nFriend\n, Mar. 2020, 2–3, or\nLiahona\n, Mar. 2020, F2–F3).\nShare an experience when the Holy Ghost communicated with you, either through your thoughts or through a feeling in your heart (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n8:2–3\n; see also Henry B. Eyring, “\nOpen Your Heart to the Holy Ghost\n,”\nFriend\n, Aug. 2019, 2–3, or\nLiahona\n, Aug. 2019, F2–F3). Testify to the children that the Holy Ghost can help them in similar ways.\nHelp the children recognize times when they are feeling the Spirit—for example, when singing a song about the Savior or when doing something kind for others. Help them recognize the spiritual feelings that the Holy Ghost brings, especially His promptings to act. Why do you think the Holy Ghost gives us these feelings? Help the children think of things that we need to do to hear the Holy Ghost speak to us. Talk about what you do to hear the Spirit more clearly.\nThe Sacrament\nWhen I take the sacrament, I remember the Savior’s sacrifice and make a covenant with Him.\nWhen we partake of the sacrament, we make a covenant to always remember the Savior, take His name upon ourselves, and keep His commandments.\nTo learn more, see\nMatthew 26:26–30\n;\n3 Nephi 18:1–12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n.\nPossible Activities\nInvite the children to color “\nJesus Introduced the Sacrament to the Nephites\n” in\nScripture Stories Coloring Book: Book of Mormon\n(2019), 26. Ask them to point to what the people are thinking about in the picture. Read to the children portions of\n3 Nephi 18:1–12\nor “\nJesus Shares the Sacrament\n,” in\nBook of Mormon Stories\n. What can we do to remember Jesus Christ during the sacrament?\nAsk the children to tell you some things they should always remember to do, such as tying their shoes or washing their hands before they eat. Why is it important to remember these things? Read\nMoroni 4:3\nto the children, and invite them to listen for what we promise to always remember when we take the sacrament. Why is it important to remember Jesus Christ? Help the children understand how the bread and water of the sacrament help us remember what Jesus has done for us (see\nMoroni 4:3\n;\n5:2\n).\nWrite on the board\n“I promise to …”\nRead the sacrament prayers to the children (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n). When they hear a promise we make to God, pause and help them complete the sentence on the board with the promise they heard.\nWhat does it mean to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ? To help the children answer this question, share an example of something that we put our names on. Why do we put our names on these things? Why would Jesus Christ want to put His name upon us? Consider sharing this explanation from President Russell M. Nelson: “Taking the Savior’s name upon us includes declaring and witnessing to others—through our actions and our words—that Jesus is the Christ” (“\nThe Correct Name of the Church\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 88).\nPriesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nGod blesses His children through priesthood power.\nAll of God’s children—female and male, young and old—receive God’s power as they keep the covenants they have made with Him. We make these covenants when we receive priesthood ordinances such as baptism (see\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n3.5\n,\n3.6\n, Gospel Library). To learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; “\nPriesthood Principles\n,”\nchapter 3\nin\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nPossible Activities\nHelp the children notice the blessings they receive because of the priesthood. To give them some ideas, you could show the video “Blessings of the Priesthood” (Gospel Library). Consider listing these blessings on the board. Why are these blessings important to us? Testify that these blessings come to us because of Jesus Christ and His priesthood power.\nBlessings of the Priesthood\nHelp the children find pictures that illustrate how God uses His power to bless us. For example, they could find a picture of the world He created for us, examples of healing the sick, and sacred ordinances He has provided for us (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n3\n,\n46\n,\n104\n,\n105\n,\n107\n,\n120\n). Share why you are grateful for the priesthood and the blessings it brings. Help the children think of experiences when they were blessed by God’s priesthood power.\nOne of the main ways we receive the blessings of God’s power in our lives is through priesthood ordinances (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:20\n). To help the children learn this truth, you could list the following scriptures on the board:\n3 Nephi 11:21–26, 33\n(baptism);\nMoroni 2\n(confirmation);\nMoroni 4–5\n(sacrament). The children could each choose one of these passages and identify the ordinance it describes. Invite the children to share how they have been personally blessed by receiving priesthood ordinances.\nHelp the children understand that they will receive power from God as they are baptized and keep their baptismal covenant. Ask the children how this power could help them.\nGod’s work is directed by priesthood keys and accomplished by priesthood authority.\nWhenever a person is set apart for a calling or assigned to help in God’s work, she or he can exercise delegated priesthood authority. In addition, worthy male Church members can have the priesthood conferred on them and be ordained to a priesthood office. The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by leaders who hold priesthood keys, such as the stake president, the bishop, and quorum presidents. Priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood in doing the work of the Lord.\nPossible Activities\nRead with the children\nMark 3:14–15\n, and show them a picture of the event described there (such as\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n38\n). Ask the children if they have ever seen someone be set apart for a calling or ordained to a priesthood office (or tell them about experiences you have had). How is that similar to what the Savior did with His Apostles? Help the children list on the board callings or priesthood offices that can be given to members of the Church, such as a teacher or leader in an organization. Next to each calling or office, you could write what someone with that calling or office has the authority to do. Tell the children how being set apart by someone with the direction of priesthood keys has helped you serve.\nInvite the children to think of something that you need a key for, such as a car or a door. What happens if you don’t have the key? Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 65:2\n, and share your testimony about the importance of having priesthood keys. You could also watch the video “Where Are the Keys?” (Gospel Library) and look for what Elder Gary E. Stevenson teaches about priesthood keys.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nThe Temple and the Plan of Happiness\nThe temple is the house of the Lord.\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Him, are endowed with priesthood power, receive revelation, perform ordinances for our deceased ancestors, and are sealed to our families for eternity. All of this is possible because of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.\nHow can you help the children you teach recognize the sacredness of the Lord’s house and prepare themselves to be worthy to participate in temple ordinances? Consider reviewing these resources: Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 93–96; “\nWhy Latter-day Saints Build Temples\n,” temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children.\nPossible Activities\nDisplay one or more pictures of temples. Ask the children what makes the temple a special place. Point out that on each temple is this inscription: “Holiness to the Lord—The House of the Lord.” Ask the children what they think “Holiness to the Lord” might mean. Why is the temple called the house of the Lord? What does this teach us about the temple? If any of the children have been to a temple, they could also share how they felt when they were there. If you have been to the temple, share how you have felt the Lord’s presence there, and talk about why the temple is a sacred place to you.\nRead together\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:15–17\n. Ask the children to look for what the Lord expects of people who enter His holy house. Why do we need to be worthy to enter His house? As part of this conversation, talk to the children about temple recommends, including how to receive one. You could invite a member of the bishopric to share with them what a temple recommend interview is like and the questions that are asked in one.\nIn the temple, we make covenants with God.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “Jesus Christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our Heavenly Parents and be with those we love” (“\nCome, Follow Me\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 91). Help the children understand that the covenant path includes baptism, confirmation, and the temple endowment and sealing.\nPossible Activities\nAsk the children to help you review the covenants that we make with God when we are baptized and when we partake of the sacrament (see\nMosiah 18:10, 13\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n). Show a picture of the temple, and explain that Heavenly Father has more blessings He wants to give us in the temple.\nDraw a gate leading to a path. Ask the children why they think it is helpful to have a path to walk on. Read together\n2 Nephi 31:17–20\n, where Nephi compares the covenant of baptism to a gate and invites us to continue on the path after baptism. There are more covenants to make after baptism, including covenants made in the temple. Explain that President Nelson has called this path the “covenant path.”\nIn the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed for ancestors who have died.\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for all of God’s children to return to live with Him, even if they die without knowing the gospel. In the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed on their behalf.\nPossible Activities\nTalk about a time when someone did something for you that you could not do for yourself. Invite the children to share similar experiences. Explain that when we go to the temple, we can receive sacred ordinances such as baptism for others who have died. How are we being like Jesus when we are doing work for the dead? What has He done for us that we couldn’t do for ourselves?\nInvite one or more youth who have been baptized for their ancestors to share their experience. Ask them what it was like in the temple. Encourage them to share how they felt doing this work for their ancestors.\nDraw a tree on the board, including the roots and branches. Ask the children to think of how a family is like a tree. Label the roots\nAncestors\n, label the branches\nDescendants\n, and label the trunk of the tree\nYou\n. Read together this sentence from\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\n: “For we without them [our ancestors] cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.” Ask questions like the following: “Why do we need our ancestors? Why do our ancestors need us? How have our parents, grandparents, and other ancestors helped us?” Invite the children to search the rest of\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\nfor a phrase that describes how we can help our ancestors.\nConsider working with the parents of each child to find the name of an ancestor who needs ordinances in the temple (see\nFamilySearch.org\n)."

      "date_range": "",
      "intro": [
        "With the direction of the bishop, the children’s sacrament meeting presentation is normally held during the fourth quarter of the year. As the Primary presidency and music leader, work with the counselor in the bishopric who oversees Primary to plan the presentation.",
        "The presentation should allow the children to present what they and their families have learned from the Old Testament at home and in Primary, including the Primary songs they have sung during the year. As you plan the presentation, think of ways it can help the congregation focus on the Savior and His teachings.",
        "Units with small numbers of children may consider ways in which family members can participate with their children. A member of the bishopric may conclude the meeting with brief remarks.",
        "As you prepare the presentation, remember the following guidelines:",
        "See General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 12.2.1.2 , Gospel Library.",
        "5 minutes (Primary presidency): Opening prayer, scripture or article of faith, and one talk",
        "20 minutes (music leader): Singing time",
        "The Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. A list of songs that reinforce these principles is included in this guide.",
        "As you teach songs to the children, invite them to share what they have already learned about the stories and doctrinal principles that the songs teach. Invite the children to share their thoughts and feelings about the truths found in the songs.",
        "The Children’s Songbook is the basic resource for music in Primary. Hymns from the hymnbook and songs from the Friend are also appropriate. You can also use songs from Hymns—For Home and Church . The use of any other music in Primary must be approved by the bishopric (see General Handbook , 12.3.4 ).",
        "Singing time is intended to help the children learn the truths of the gospel. The following ideas can inspire you as you plan ways to teach the gospel principles found in hymns and Primary songs.",
        "Read related scriptures. For many of the songs in the Children’s Songbook and the hymnbook, references to related scriptures are listed. Help the children read some of these passages, and talk about how the scriptures are related to the song. You could also list a few scripture references on the board and invite the children to match each reference to a song or a verse from a song.",
        "Fill in the blank. Write a verse of the song on the board with several key words missing. Then ask the children to sing the song, listening for the words that fill in the blanks. As they fill in each blank, discuss what gospel principles you learn from the missing words.",
        "Testify. Bear brief testimony to the children of gospel truths found in the Primary song. Help the children understand that singing is one way they can bear testimony and feel the Spirit.",
        "Stand as a witness. Invite children to take turns standing and sharing what they learn from the song they are singing or how they feel about the truths taught in the song. Ask them how they feel as they sing the song, and help them identify the influence of the Holy Ghost.",
        "Use pictures. Ask the children to help you find or create pictures that go with important words or phrases in the song. Invite them to share how the pictures relate to the song and what the song teaches. For example, if you are teaching the song “ When He Comes Again ” ( Children’s Songbook , 82–83), you could place pictures throughout the room that depict important words from the song (such as angels , snow , and star ). Ask the children to gather the pictures and hold them up in the correct order as you sing the song together.",
        "Share an object lesson. You could use an object to inspire discussion about a song. For example, when singing the song “ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ” ( Children’s Songbook , 228–29), you could show the children a picture of things like a bird, rain, or flowers. This could lead to a discussion about how we can find signs of Heavenly Father’s love all around us.",
        "Invite sharing of personal experiences. Help the children connect the principles taught in the song with experiences they have had with these principles.
