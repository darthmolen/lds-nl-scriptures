For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond a classroom into our hearts and homes. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. Gospel learning that leads to true conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ."

How much and how long you read as a family is not as important as being consistent in your efforts. As you make scripture study an important part of your family life, you will help your family members come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and build their testimonies on the foundation of God’s word. Consider counseling together about the following questions:\nHow can your family members encourage each other to study the scriptures individually?\nWhat can your family members do to encourage each person to share what they are learning?\nHow can you emphasize the principles you are learning in the New Testament in everyday teaching moments?\nRemember that the home is the ideal place for gospel learning. You can learn and teach the gospel at home in ways that are not possible in a Church class. Be creative as you think of ways to help your family learn from the scriptures. Consider some of the following ideas to enhance your family scripture study.\nUse Music\nSing songs that reinforce the principles taught in the scriptures. A suggested hymn or children’s song is listed in each weekly outline. You might ask family members questions about words or phrases in the lyrics. In addition to singing, your family can perform actions that go with the songs or listen to the songs as background music while they are doing other activities. For more ideas, see “\nIncluding Sacred Music in Your Gospel Learning\n” in this resource.\nShare Meaningful Scriptures\nGive family members time to share scripture passages that they have found meaningful during their personal study.\nUse Your Own Words\nInvite family members to summarize in their own words what they learn from the scriptures you study.\nApply the Scriptures to Your Life\nAfter reading a scripture passage, ask family members to share ways the passage applies to their lives.\nAsk a Question\nInvite family members to ask a gospel question, and then spend time looking for verses that can help answer the question.\nDisplay a Scripture\nSelect a verse you find meaningful, and display it where family members will see it often. Invite other family members to take turns selecting a scripture to display.\nMake a Scripture List\nAs a family, choose several verses that you would like to discuss during the coming week.\nMemorize Scriptures\nSelect a scripture passage that is meaningful to your family, and invite family members to memorize it by repeating it daily or playing a memorization game.\nShare Object Lessons\nFind objects that relate to the gospel principles in the scripture passages you are reading as a family. Invite family members to talk about how each object relates to the teachings in the scriptures.\nPick a Topic\nLet family members take turns choosing a topic that the family will study together. Use the\nTopical Guide\n, the\nBible Dictionary\n, or the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n(\nscriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n) to find scripture passages about the topic.\nDraw a Picture\nRead a few verses as a family, and then allow time for family members to draw something that relates to what you read. Spend time discussing one another’s drawings.\nAct Out a Story\nAfter reading a story, invite family members to act it out. Afterward, talk about how the story relates to the things that you are experiencing individually and as a family.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson said: “I promise that as you diligently work to remodel your home into a center of gospel learning, over time\nyour\nSabbath days will truly be a delight.\nYour\nchildren will be excited to learn and to live the Savior’s teachings, and the influence of the adversary in\nyour\nlife and in\nyour\nhome will decrease. Changes in your family will be dramatic and sustaining” (“\nBecoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 113)."

Use the\ntopics index\nat the back of the\nChildren’s Songbook\nto find songs that relate to the gospel principles you are teaching. Help your children relate the messages of the songs to their lives. (See also “\nIncluding Sacred Music in Your Gospel Learning\n” in this resource.)\nListen to or act out a story.\nYoung children love stories—from the scriptures, from your life, from Church history or your family history, and from\nChurch magazines\n. Look for ways to involve them in storytelling. They can hold pictures or objects, draw pictures of what they are hearing, act out the story, or even help tell the story. Help your children recognize the gospel truths in the stories you share.\nRead a scripture.\nYoung children may not be able to read very much, but you can still engage them in learning from the scriptures. You may need to focus on a single verse, key phrase, or word. The children may even be able to memorize short phrases from the scriptures if they repeat them a few times. As they hear the word of God, they will feel the Spirit.\nLook at a picture or watch a video.\nWhen you show your children a picture or video related to a gospel principle or scripture story, ask them questions that help them learn from what they are seeing. For example, you could ask, “What is happening in this picture or video? How does it make you feel?” The Gospel Media app,\nGospelMedia.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, and\nchildren.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\nare good places to look for pictures and videos.\nCreate.\nChildren can build, draw, or color something related to the story or principle they are learning.\nParticipate in object lessons.\nA simple object lesson can help your children understand a gospel principle that is difficult to comprehend. When using object lessons, find ways to let your children participate. They will learn more from an interactive experience than from just watching a demonstration.\nRole-play.\nWhen children role-play a situation they are likely to encounter in real life, they are better able to understand how a gospel principle applies to their lives.\nRepeat activities.\nYoung children may need to hear concepts multiple times to understand them. Don’t be afraid to repeat stories or activities often. For example, you might share a scripture story several times in different ways—by reading from the scriptures, summarizing in your own words, showing a video, letting your children help you tell the story, inviting them to act out the story, and so on."

These ideas can help you use sacred music as you strive to learn and live the gospel.\nLearn doctrinal principles.\nLook for truths taught in the songs you sing or listen to. This may lead to gospel discussions about these truths throughout the day. Sing or listen to Primary songs or hymns that teach about Jesus Christ and His gospel. Pay attention to ways the Holy Ghost testifies of the Savior and His teachings.\nRecognize music’s power.\nSinging or listening to Primary songs and hymns can be a blessing in times of need. For instance, singing a song could calm a child at bedtime, create joy as your family works together, uplift a neighbor who is sick, or comfort someone who feels anxious.\nShare experiences.\nShare personal and family experiences that relate to the messages of the songs. You can also share related scripture stories.\nInvolve your family.\nYour family will learn more from songs if they are actively participating. To involve family members, you could invite an older child to help teach a song to younger siblings or invite children to teach the family a song they learned in Primary. You could also let family members take turns leading a song.\nBe creative.\nUse a variety of ways to learn sacred music as a family. For instance, you could do actions that go with words and phrases in a song. Or you could take turns acting out parts of a song while other family members try to guess the song. Your family might enjoy singing songs at different speeds or volumes. The Gospel Library app and the Gospel for Kids app have audio recordings and videos that can help you learn the songs. You could also make playlists of sacred music to listen to.\nFor more ideas, see the sections “\nUsing Music to Teach Doctrine\n” and “\nHelping Children Learn and Remember Primary Songs and Hymns\n,” found in “Instructions for Singing Time and the Children’s Sacrament Meeting Presentation” in\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n."

We Are Responsible for Our Own Learning,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nDecember 26–January 1\nWe Are Responsible for Our Own Learning\nThe purpose of the scriptures is to help you come unto Christ and become more deeply converted to His gospel.\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families\ncan help you understand the scriptures and find in them the spiritual strength you and your family need. Then, in your Church classes, you will have opportunities to share insights and encourage your fellow Saints in their efforts to follow Christ.\nRecord Your Impressions\n“What seek ye?” Jesus asked the disciples of John the Baptist (\nJohn 1:38\n). You might ask yourself the same question—for what you find in the New Testament this year will greatly depend on what you seek. “Seek, and ye shall find” is the Savior’s promise (\nMatthew 7:7\n). So ask the questions that come to your mind as you study, and then seek diligently for answers. In the New Testament you will read about the powerful spiritual experiences of disciples of Jesus Christ. As a faithful disciple of the Savior, you can have your own powerful spiritual experiences as you accept the Savior’s invitation, found throughout this sacred volume, “Come, follow me” (\nLuke 18:22\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nTo truly learn from the Savior, I must accept His invitation, “Come, follow me.”\nThe Savior’s invitation, “Come, follow me,” applies to all—whether we are new on the path of discipleship or have walked it all our lives. This was His invitation to a rich young man who was striving to keep the commandments (see\nMatthew 19:16–22\n;\nLuke 18:18–23\n). What the young man learned—and what we all must learn—is that being a disciple means giving our whole souls to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. We progress in our discipleship as we identify what we lack, make changes, and seek to more fully follow Them.\nLearning from the Savior starts when we strive to understand what He taught. For example, how does your understanding of humility deepen as you explore the following?\nThe Savior’s teachings (see\nMatthew 18:1–5\n;\nLuke 18:9–14\n)\nAn example from His life (see\nJohn 13:1–15\n)\nIf you want to learn more, try this activity with another gospel principle, such as love or forgiveness.\nI am responsible for my own learning.\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “We should not expect the Church as an organization to teach or tell us everything we need to know and do to become devoted disciples and endure valiantly to the end. Rather, our personal responsibility is to learn what we should learn, to live as we know we should live, and to become who the Master would have us become. And our homes are the ultimate setting for learning, living, and becoming” (“\nPrepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 102).\nWhat does it mean to take responsibility for your own learning? Look for possible answers in Elder Bednar’s statement and in the following scriptures:\nJohn 7:17\n;\n1 Thessalonians 5:21\n;\nJames 1:5–6, 22\n;\n2:17\n;\n1 Nephi 10:17–19\n;\n2 Nephi 4:15\n;\nAlma 32:27\n; and\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:18\n;\n58:26–28\n;\n88:118\n. What do you feel inspired to do to be more active in learning the gospel?\nI need to know the truth for myself.\nPerhaps you know people who never seem to lose their faith, no matter what happens in their lives. They may remind you of the five wise virgins in the Savior’s parable (see\nMatthew 25:1–13\n). What you may not see are their diligent efforts to strengthen their testimonies of the truth.\nHow do we gain and nurture our own testimonies? Write down your thoughts as you ponder the following scriptures:\nLuke 11:9–13\n;\nJohn 5:39\n;\n7:14–17\n;\nActs 17:10–12\n;\n1 Corinthians 2:9–11\n; and\nAlma 5:45–46\n. (See also Gospel Topics, “\nTestimony\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.)\nEach of us must gain a testimony for ourselves.\nWhat should I do when I have questions?\nAs you seek spiritual knowledge, questions will come to your mind. The following principles can help you address questions in ways that build faith and testimony:\nSeek understanding from God.\nGod is the source of all truth, and He reveals truth through the Holy Ghost, the scriptures, and His prophets and apostles.\nAct in faith.\nIf answers don’t come right away, trust that the Lord will reveal answers when the time is right. In the meantime, keep living by the truth you already know.\nKeep an eternal perspective.\nTry to see things as the Lord sees them, not as the world does. View your questions in the context of our Heavenly Father’s plan of salvation.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMatthew 13:1–23\n.\nTo help your family prepare to learn from the New Testament this year, you could read the parable of the sower. Your family might enjoy going outside and looking for the different types of ground described in the parable. How can we make our hearts like the “good ground” Jesus described? (\nMatthew 13:8\n).\nGalatians 5:22–23\n;\nPhilippians 4:8\n.\nPresident Russell M.

Matthew 1; Luke 1,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nJanuary 2–8\nMatthew 1\n;\nLuke 1\n“Be It unto Me according to Thy Word”\nAs you read and ponder\nMatthew 1\nand\nLuke 1\n, record the spiritual impressions you receive. What doctrinal truths do you find? What messages will be of most value to you and your family? The study ideas in this outline may help you discover additional insights.\nRecord Your Impressions\nFrom a mortal perspective, it was impossible. A virgin could not conceive—nor could a barren woman who was well past childbearing years. But God had a plan for the birth of His Son and the birth of John the Baptist, so both Mary and Elisabeth, against all earthly odds, became mothers. It can be helpful to remember their miraculous experiences whenever we face something that seems impossible. Can we overcome our weaknesses? Can we touch the heart of an unresponsive family member? Gabriel could easily have been speaking to us when he reminded Mary, “With God nothing shall be impossible” (\nLuke 1:37\n). And Mary’s response can also be ours when God reveals His will: “Be it unto me according to thy word” (\nLuke 1:38\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWho were Matthew and Luke?\nMatthew was a Jewish publican, or tax collector, whom Jesus called as one of His Apostles (see\nMatthew 10:3\n; see also Bible Dictionary, “\nPublicans\n”). Matthew wrote his Gospel mainly to fellow Jews; therefore, he chose to emphasize Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah that were fulfilled through Jesus’s life and ministry.\nLuke was a Gentile (non-Jewish) physician who traveled with the Apostle Paul. He wrote his Gospel after the Savior’s death primarily to a non-Jewish audience. He testified of Jesus Christ as the Savior of both the Gentiles and the Jews. He recorded eyewitness accounts of events in the Savior’s life, and he included more stories involving women compared to the other Gospels.\nSee also Bible Dictionary, “\nGospels\n,” “\nMatthew\n,” “\nLuke\n.”\nMatthew 1:18–25\n;\nLuke 1:26–35\nJesus Christ was born of a mortal mother and an immortal Father.\nIn\nMatthew 1:18–25\nand\nLuke 1:26–35\n, notice how Matthew and Luke described the miracle of Jesus’s birth. How do their descriptions strengthen your faith in the Savior? Why is it important to you to know that Jesus was both the Son of God and the son of Mary?\nPresident Russell M. Nelson explained that the Atonement of Jesus Christ “required a personal sacrifice by an immortal being not subject to death. Yet He must die and take up His own body again. The Savior was the only one who could accomplish this. From His mother He inherited power to die. From His Father He obtained power over death” (“\nConstancy amid Change\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1993, 34).\nLuke 1:5–25, 57–80\nGod’s blessings come in His own time.\nIf you find yourself having to wait for a blessing or if it seems that God isn’t hearing your prayers, the story of Elisabeth and Zacharias can be a reminder that He hasn’t forgotten you. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland promised: “While we work and wait together for the answers to some of our prayers, I offer you my apostolic promise that they are heard and they are answered, though perhaps not at the time or in the way we wanted. But they are\nalways\nanswered at the time and in the way an omniscient and eternally compassionate parent should answer them” (“\nWaiting on the Lord\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 115–16). How did Zacharias and Elisabeth remain faithful? (see\nLuke 1:5–25, 57–80\n). Do you find yourself waiting for a blessing? What do you feel the Lord expects of you while you wait?\nAfter faithfully waiting, Elisabeth and Zacharias were blessed with a son.\nMatthew 1:18–25\n;\nLuke 1:26–38\nThe faithful willingly submit to God’s will.\nLike Mary, we sometimes find that God’s plans for our life are quite different from what we had planned. What do you learn from Mary about accepting God’s will? In the following tables, write statements from the angel and Mary (see\nLuke 1:26–38\n), along with the messages that you find in their statements:\nThe angel’s words to Mary\nMessage for me\nThe angel’s words to Mary\n“The Lord is with thee” (\nverse 28\n).\nMessage for me\nThe Lord is aware of my situation and struggles.\nThe angel’s words to Mary\nMessage for me\nThe angel’s words to Mary\nMessage for me\nMary’s reactions\nMessage for me\nMary’s reactions\n“How shall this be?” (\nverse 34\n).\nMessage for me\nIt’s OK to ask questions to better understand God’s will.\nMary’s reactions\nMessage for me\nMary’s reactions\nMessage for me\nAs you read about Joseph’s righteous example in\nMatthew 1:18–25\n, what do you learn about accepting God’s will? What additional insights do you learn from the experiences of Zacharias and Elisabeth? (see\nLuke 1\n).\nSee also\nLuke 22:42\n; Bible Dictionary, “\nGabriel\n.”\nLuke 1:46–55\nMary testified of Jesus Christ’s mission.\nMary’s words in\nLuke 1:46–55\nforetold aspects of the Savior’s mission. What do you learn about Jesus Christ from Mary’s statements? You might compare these verses with Hannah’s words in\n1 Samuel 2:1–10\nand with Jesus’s Beatitudes in\nMatthew 5:3–12\n. What does the Spirit teach you as you ponder these verses?\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMatthew 1:1–17\n.\nAs your family reads the genealogy of Jesus, you might discuss your own family history and share some stories about your ancestors. How does knowing about your family history bless your family? For more family history activities, see\nFamilySearch.org/discovery\n.\nMatthew 1:20\n;\nLuke 1:11–13, 30\n.\nWhy might the people in these verses have been fearful? What causes us to feel fearful? How does God invite us to “fear not”?\nLuke 1:37\n.\nTo help your family build faith that “with God nothing shall be impossible,” you could search\nLuke 1\ntogether and find things God did that might be considered impossible. What other stories can we share—from the scriptures or our own lives—in which God did seemingly impossible things? Searching through the\nGospel Art Book\ncould provide ideas.\nLuke 1:46–55\n.\nWhat are some of the “great things” the Savior has done for us? What could it mean for our souls to “magnify the Lord”?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested song: “\nHe Sent His Son\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 34–35.\nImproving Our Teaching\nApply the scriptures to your life.\nAfter reading a scripture passage, invite family members to apply it to their lives (see\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n21\n).

Matthew 2; Luke 2,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nLet Us Adore Him\n, by Dana Mario Wood\nJanuary 9–15\nMatthew 2\n;\nLuke 2\nWe Have Come to Worship Him\nAs you read\nMatthew 2\nand\nLuke 2\n, pay attention to any spiritual insights you receive. The study ideas in this outline can help you identify important and relevant principles in these chapters.\nRecord Your Impressions\nFrom the day of His birth, it was clear that Jesus was no ordinary child. It wasn’t just the new star in the heavens or the joyous angelic proclamation that made Jesus’s infancy remarkable. It was also the fact that such a variety of faithful people—from different nations, professions, and backgrounds—felt immediately drawn to Him. Even before He uttered His invitation to “come, follow me,” they came (\nLuke 18:22\n). Not everyone came to Him, of course. There were many who paid Him no notice, and a jealous ruler even sought His life. But the humble, pure, devoted seekers of righteousness saw Him for who He was—their promised Messiah. Their devotion inspires our own, for the “good tidings of great joy” brought to the shepherds were for “all people,” and the “Saviour, which is Christ the Lord” was born that day unto all of us (see\nLuke 2:10–11\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nLuke 2:1–7\nJesus Christ was born in humble circumstances.\nAlthough Jesus Christ had glory with God the Father “before the world was” (\nJohn 17:5\n), He was willing to be born in lowly circumstances and live among us on earth. As you read\nLuke 2:1–7\n, ponder what this account of His birth teaches you about Him. Try to identify details or insights in this story that you hadn’t noticed before. How does noticing these things affect your feelings toward Him?\nSee also “The Christ Child” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe Christ Child\nMatthew 2:1–12\n;\nLuke 2:8–38\nThere are many witnesses of the birth of Christ.\nThe birth and infancy of Christ were marked by witnesses and worshippers from many walks of life. As you explore their stories, what do you learn about ways to worship and witness of Christ?\nWitness of Christ\nWhat do I learn about worshipping and witnessing of Christ?\nWitness of Christ\nShepherds (\nLuke 2:8–20\n)\nWhat do I learn about worshipping and witnessing of Christ?\nWitness of Christ\nSimeon (\nLuke 2:25–35\n)\nWhat do I learn about worshipping and witnessing of Christ?\nWitness of Christ\nAnna (\nLuke 2:36–38\n)\nWhat do I learn about worshipping and witnessing of Christ?\nWitness of Christ\nWise Men (\nMatthew 2:1–12\n)\nWhat do I learn about worshipping and witnessing of Christ?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 11:13–23\n;\n3 Nephi 1:5–21\n; “Shepherds Learn of the Birth of Christ” and “The Christ Child Is Presented at the Temple” (videos),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nShepherds Learn of the Birth of Christ\nThe Christ Child Is Presented at the Temple\nMatthew 2:13–23\nParents can receive revelation to protect their families.\nJoseph never could have done what he was asked to do—protect Jesus in His childhood—without heaven’s help. Like the Wise Men, he received a revelation that warned him of danger. As you read about Joseph’s experience in\nMatthew 2:13–23\n, think about physical and spiritual dangers that face us today. Ponder experiences when you have felt God’s guidance in protecting you and your loved ones. Consider sharing these experiences with others. What can you do to receive such guidance in the future?\nAdditionally, you might consider watching the video “The First Christmas Spirit” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n) for a depiction of what Joseph may have felt as he faced the responsibility of caring for the Son of God.\nThe First Christmas Spirit\nLuke 2:40–52\nEven as a youth, Jesus was focused on doing His Father’s will.\nAs a young man, the Savior taught the gospel so powerfully that even the teachers in the temple were astonished at His “understanding and answers” (\nLuke 2:47\n). What do you learn from these verses about the Savior as a young man? How are young people you know trying to “be about [their] Father’s business”? (\nLuke 2:49\n). How have youth and children helped you gain a deeper understanding of the gospel? What else do you learn from the example of Jesus’s childhood in\nLuke 2:40–52\nand in\nJoseph Smith Translation, Matthew 3:24–26\n(in the Bible appendix)?\n“Wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?” (\nLuke 2:49\n).\nWhat is the Joseph Smith Translation?\nBecause “many plain and precious” truths were lost from the Bible over the centuries (\n1 Nephi 13:28\n; see also\nMoses 1:41\n), the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to make an inspired revision of the Bible, known as the Joseph Smith Translation. Many revisions made by the Prophet are included in the appendix of the Latter-day Saint edition of the scriptures. The Latter-day Saint edition of the King James Version of the Bible also contains footnotes with the Prophet’s revisions. Joseph Smith’s translation of\nMatthew 24\n, known as\nJoseph Smith—Matthew\n, can be found in the Pearl of Great Price. For more information, see “\nJoseph Smith Translation (JST)\n” in the Bible Dictionary and the Gospel Topics article “\nBible, Inerrancy of\n” (\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nLuke 2\n.\nInvite family members to select a person described in\nLuke 2\n, read a few verses about that person’s interactions with the Savior, and share something that they learned that increases their faith in Jesus Christ. Sing together “\nMary’s Lullaby\n” or “\nThe Nativity Song\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 44–45, 52–53). What do we learn from these songs about the Savior’s birth?\nConsider how artwork might enhance your discussion about Christ’s birth. (For examples, see\nGospel Art Book\nor\nhistory.ChurchofJesusChrist.org/exhibit/birth-of-Christ\n.)\nMatthew 2:1–12\n.\nWhat do we learn about seeking and finding the Savior from the example of the Wise Men?\nLuke 2:41–49\n.\nWhat is the “Father’s business”? (\nLuke 2:49\n; see\nMoses 1:39\n;\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n1.2\n,\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). What do we learn about that business from the story in\nLuke 2:41–49\n? Consider writing down some ways your family can participate in the Father’s business and placing them in a jar. During the coming week, as your family looks for ways to help with Heavenly Father’s work, they can select ideas from the jar. Plan a time when you will share your experiences.\nLuke 2:52\n.\nWhat can we learn from\nLuke 2:52\nabout how Jesus developed in His life? What personal or family goals can we set to increase “in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man”?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested song: “\nStars Were Gleaming\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 37.\nImproving Personal Study\nUse scripture study helps.\nTo gain additional insights as you study the scriptures, use resources like the footnotes,\nTopical Guide\n,\nBible Dictionary\n,\nGuide to the Scriptures\n, and other study helps found at\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe Savior of the World came to earth in humble circumstances."

What messages do you find that will be of most value to you and your family? What could you share in your Church classes?\nRecord Your Impressions\nHave you ever wondered whether you would have recognized Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God if you had been alive during His mortal ministry? For years, faithful Israelites, including Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathanael, had waited and prayed for the coming of the promised Messiah. When they met Him, how did they know that He was the One they had been seeking? The same way all of us come to know the Savior—by accepting the invitation to “come and see” for ourselves (\nJohn 1:39\n). We read about Him in the scriptures. We hear His doctrine. We observe His way of living. We feel His Spirit. Along the way, we discover, as Nathanael did, that the Savior knows us and loves us and wants to prepare us to receive “greater things” (\nJohn 1:50\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWho was John?\nJohn was a disciple of John the Baptist and later became one of the first followers of Jesus Christ and one of His Twelve Apostles.

Record these impressions, and make plans to act on them.\nRecord Your Impressions\nJesus Christ and His gospel can change you. Luke quoted an ancient prophecy of Isaiah that described the effect that the Savior’s coming would have: “Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth” (\nLuke 3:5\n; see also\nIsaiah 40:4\n). This is a message for all of us, including those who think they cannot change. If something as permanent as a mountain can be flattened, then surely the Lord can help us straighten our own crooked paths (see\nLuke 3:4–5\n). As we accept John the Baptist’s invitation to repent and change, we prepare our minds and hearts to receive Jesus Christ so that we too can “see the salvation of God” (\nLuke 3:6\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWho was Mark?\nAmong the authors of the Gospels, we know the least about Mark.

Ponder how the scriptures can build your faith and your resolve to resist temptation.\nRecord Your Impressions\nFrom His youth, Jesus seemed to be aware that He had a unique, sacred mission. But as Jesus prepared to begin His earthly ministry, the adversary sought to plant doubt in the Savior’s mind. “\nIf\nthou be the Son of God,” Satan said (\nLuke 4:3\n, italics added). But the Savior had communed with His Father in Heaven. He knew the scriptures, and He knew who He was. To Him, Satan’s offer—“All this power will I give thee” (\nLuke 4:6\n)—was a hollow one, for the Savior’s lifelong preparation allowed Him to receive “the power of the Spirit” (\nLuke 4:14\n). So despite temptation, trials, and rejection, Jesus Christ never wavered from His appointed work: “I must preach the kingdom of God … for therefore am I sent” (\nLuke 4:43\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 4:1–2\nCommuning with God prepares me to serve Him.\nTo prepare for His mission, Jesus went into the wilderness “to be with God” (\nJoseph Smith Translation, Matthew 4:1\n[in\nMatthew 4:1, footnote\nb\n]).

Make note of His promptings. You may find additional spiritual insights from the study ideas in this outline.\nRecord Your Impressions\nAt a marriage feast in Cana, Christ changed water into wine—an event John called the “beginning of miracles” (\nJohn 2:11\n). That’s true in more than one sense. While this was the first miracle Jesus performed publicly, it can also symbolize another miraculous beginning—the process of our hearts being transformed as we become ever more like our Savior. This miracle of a lifetime begins with the decision to follow Jesus Christ, to change and live a better life through Him. This miracle can be so life-changing that being “born again” is one of the best ways to describe it (\nJohn 3:7\n). But rebirth is just the beginning of the path of discipleship. Christ’s words to the Samaritan woman at the well remind us that if we continue on this path, eventually the gospel will become “a well of water” inside us, “springing up into everlasting life” (\nJohn 4:14\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nJohn 2:1–11\nJesus Christ’s miracles “manifested forth his glory.”\nAs you read about the Savior changing water into wine in\nJohn 2:1–11\n, you may gain additional insights by considering the perspectives of the different people who were there, including Mary, the disciples, and others.

Matthew 5; Luke 6,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nJesus Preaching Sermon on the Mount\n, by Gustave Doré\nFebruary 13–19\nMatthew 5\n;\nLuke 6\n“Blessed Are Ye”\nPay attention to impressions you receive as you read\nMatthew 5\nand\nLuke 6\n, and record them in a study journal or in some other way. This outline can help you identify some important principles in these chapters, but be open to others you discover in your study.\nRecord Your Impressions\nBy this point in His ministry, it was clear that Jesus’s teachings would be unlike what the people of His time were used to hearing. The poor will receive the kingdom of God? The meek will inherit the earth? Blessed are the persecuted? The scribes and Pharisees were not teaching such things. And yet those who truly understood God’s law recognized truth in the Savior’s words. “An eye for an eye” and “hate thine enemy” were lesser laws (\nMatthew 5:38, 43\n). But Jesus Christ had come to teach a higher law (see\n3 Nephi 15:2–10\n), designed to help us one day become “perfect, even as [our] Father which is in heaven is perfect” (\nMatthew 5:48\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 5:1–12\n;\nLuke 6:20–26, 46–49\nLasting happiness comes from living the way Jesus Christ taught.\nEverybody wants to be happy, but not everyone looks for happiness in the same places. Some search for it in worldly power and position, others in wealth or in satisfying physical appetites. Jesus Christ came to teach the way to lasting happiness, to teach what it truly means to be blessed. What do you learn about obtaining lasting happiness from\nMatthew 5:1–12\nand\nLuke 6:20–26\n? How is this different from the world’s view of happiness?\nWhat do these verses, together with\nLuke 6:46–49\n, teach you about being a disciple of Jesus Christ? What do you feel inspired to do to develop the qualities described in these verses?\nSee also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nBeatitudes\n,”\nscriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; “Sermon on the Mount: The Beatitudes” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nSermon on the Mount: The Beatitudes\nMatthew 5:13\n“Ye are the salt of the earth.”\nSalt has long been used to preserve, flavor, and purify. Salt also had religious meaning for the Israelites. It was associated with the ancient practice of animal sacrifice under the law of Moses (see\nLeviticus 2:13\n;\nNumbers 18:19\n). When salt loses its savor, it becomes ineffective, or “good for nothing” (\nMatthew 5:13\n). This happens when it is mixed with or contaminated by other elements.\nKeep this in mind as you ponder\nMatthew 5:13\n. How will you keep your savor as a disciple of Jesus Christ? How will you fulfill your preserving and purifying work as the salt of the earth?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 103:9–10\n.\n“Ye are the salt of the earth” (\nMatthew 5:13\n).\nMatthew 5:17–48\n;\nLuke 6:27–35\nThe law of Christ supersedes the law of Moses.\nThe disciples may have been surprised to hear Jesus say that their righteousness needed to exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees (see\nMatthew 5:20\n), who prided themselves on how well they kept the law of Moses.\nAs you read\nMatthew 5:21–48\nand\nLuke 6:27–35\n, consider marking both the behaviors required in the law of Moses (“Ye have heard that …”) and what Jesus taught to elevate these behaviors. Why do you think the Savior’s way is a higher law?\nFor example, what did Jesus teach in\nMatthew 5:27–28\nabout our responsibility over our thoughts?

Nelson taught:\n“The term\nperfect\nwas translated from the Greek\nteleios\n, which means ‘complete.’ … The infinitive form of the verb is\nteleiono\n, which means ‘to reach a distant end, to be fully developed, to consummate, or to finish.’ Please note that the word does not imply ‘freedom from error’; it implies ‘achieving a distant objective.’ …\n“… The Lord taught, ‘Ye are not able to abide the presence of God now … ; wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected’ [\nDoctrine and Covenants 67:13\n].\n“We need not be dismayed if our earnest efforts toward perfection now seem so arduous and endless.

      "plain_text": "“February 20–26. Matthew 6–7: ‘He Taught Them as One Having Authority,’”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: New Testament 2023\n(2022)\n“February 20–26. Matthew 6–7,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nJesus Teaching the People by the Seashore\n, by James Tissot\nFebruary 20–26\nMatthew 6–7\n“He Taught Them as One Having Authority”\nWhen we read the scriptures with a question in mind and with a sincere desire to understand what Heavenly Father wants us to know, we invite the Holy Ghost to inspire us. As you read\nMatthew 6–7\n, pay attention to these impressions.\nRecord Your Impressions\nThe Sermon on the Mount is one of the best-known discourses in Christianity. The Savior taught with rich images, such as a city set on a hill, lilies of the field, and wolves disguised as sheep. But the Sermon on the Mount is far more than a beautiful speech. The power of the Savior’s teachings to His disciples can change our lives, especially when we live by them. Then His words become more than words; they become a sure foundation for life that, like the wise man’s house, can withstand the world’s winds and floods (see\nMatthew 7:24–25\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 6–7\nLiving the Savior’s teachings can help me become like Him.\nThe Sermon on the Mount contains many gospel principles. As you study these chapters, ask the Lord what He wants you to learn.\nOne principle you might find is the need to prioritize the things of God over the things of the world. Which of the Savior’s teachings in\nMatthew 6–7\nhelp you focus on heavenly things? What other thoughts or impressions do you have? What are you inspired to do? Consider recording your impressions. For example:\nMatthew 6:1–4\nI want to care more about what God thinks of me than what others think.\nAnother principle in\nMatthew 6–7\nis prayer. Take a moment to evaluate your prayers. How do you feel you are doing in your efforts to draw closer to God through prayer? What teachings in\nMatthew 6–7\ninspire you to improve how you pray? Record the impressions you receive. For example:\nMatthew 6:9\nWhen I pray, I want to treat Heavenly Father’s name with reverence.\nMatthew 6:10\nWhen I pray, I can express my desire that the Lord’s will be done.\nYou might consider reading the Sermon on the Mount again, looking for other recurring principles or messages that are especially applicable to you. Record what you find in a study journal, along with your thoughts and impressions.\nWe can draw closer to God through prayer.\nMatthew 6:7\nWhat does it mean to use “vain repetitions” in prayer?\nPeople often understand “vain repetitions” to mean repeating the same words over and over again. However, the word\nvain\ncan describe something that has no value. Using “vain repetitions” in prayer can mean praying without sincere, heartfelt feeling (see\nAlma 31:12–23\n).\nMatthew 7:1–5\nI can judge righteously.\nIn\nMatthew 7:1\n, the Savior may seem to be saying we should never judge, but in other scriptures (including other verses in this chapter), He gives us instructions about how to judge. If that seems puzzling, the Joseph Smith Translation of this verse might help: “Judge not\nunrighteously\n, that ye be not judged;\nbut judge righteous judgment\n” (in\nMatthew 7:1, footnote\na\n). What do you find in\nMatthew 7:1–5\n, along with the rest of the chapter, that helps you know how to “judge righteous judgment”?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nJudging Others\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; Lynn G. Robbins, “\nThe Righteous Judge\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 96–98.\nMatthew 7:21–23\nI come to know Jesus Christ by doing His will.\nThe phrase “I never knew you” in\nMatthew 7:23\nwas changed in the Joseph Smith Translation to “Ye never knew me” (\nMatthew 7:23, footnote\na\n). How does this change help you better understand what the Lord taught in\nverses 21–22\nabout doing His will? How well do you feel you know the Lord? What can you do to know Him better?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nIf Ye Had Known Me\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 102–5.\nMatthew 7:24–27\nObeying the Savior’s teachings creates a firm foundation for my life.\nLiving the gospel doesn’t remove adversity from our lives. Both houses in the Savior’s parable in\nMatthew 7:24–27\nexperienced the same storm. But one of the houses was able to withstand it. How has living the Savior’s teachings created a solid foundation for you? What do you feel inspired to do to continue building your “house upon a rock”? (see\nverse 24\n).\nSee also\nHelaman 5:12\n.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMatthew 6–7\n.\nOne way to learn from\nMatthew 6–7\nas a family is to watch the videos “Sermon on the Mount: The Lord’s Prayer” and “Sermon on the Mount: Treasures in Heaven” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Family members could follow along in their scriptures and pause the videos whenever they hear something they want to discuss. This activity could span several days, if needed.\nSermon on the Mount: The Lord's Prayer\nSermon on the Mount: Treasures in Heaven\nMatthew 6:5–13\n.\nWhat can we learn about prayer from the way the Savior prayed? How can we use His prayer as a model to improve our personal and family prayers? (See also\nLuke 11:1–13\n.) If you have younger children, you might practice praying together.\nMatthew 6:33\n.\nWhat does it mean to “seek … first the kingdom of God”? How are we doing this individually and as a family?\nMatthew 7:1–5\n.\nTo visualize the teachings in these verses, your family could find a mote (a tiny wood fragment) and a beam (a large piece of wood). What does comparing the two teach us about judging others? If you’d like to explore this topic further, you could use some of the resources in “\nJudging Others\n” (Gospel Topics,\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nMatthew 7:24–27\n.\nTo help your family better understand the Savior’s parable of the wise man and the foolish man, you could let them pour water on sand and then on a rock. How can we build our spiritual foundations on a rock?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested song: “\nThe Wise Man and the Foolish Man\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 281.\nImproving Personal Study\nShare insights.\nDiscussing principles you learn from your personal study is not only a good way to teach others; it also helps strengthen your own understanding. Try sharing a principle you learned this week with a family member or in your Church classes.\nI Have Prayed for Thee\n, by Del Parson"

Take time for prayerful pondering, even if it means you don’t have time to read every verse. These moments of pondering often lead to personal revelation.\nRecord Your Impressions\nOne of the clearest messages in the New Testament is that Jesus Christ is a healer. Accounts of the Savior healing the sick and afflicted are many—from a woman with a fever to a widow’s son who had died. Why the emphasis on physical healing? What messages might there be for us in these miracles? Certainly one obvious message is that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, with power over all things, including our physical pains and imperfections. But another meaning is found in His words to the skeptical scribes: “That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins” (\nMark 2:10\n). So when you read about a blind person or a leper being healed, you might think of the healing—both spiritual and physical—that you can receive from the Savior and hear Him say to you, “Thy faith hath saved thee” (\nLuke 7:50\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 8\n;\nMark 2–3\n;\nLuke 7\nThe Savior can heal infirmities and sicknesses.\nThese few chapters record many instances of miraculous healings performed by the Savior. As you study these healings, look for possible messages for you. You might ask yourself: What does the account teach about faith in Jesus Christ? What does the account teach about the Savior?

They should not, however, replace personal revelation you might receive about what passages to study or how to study them.\nRecord Your Impressions\nWord of Jesus’s healing miracles was spreading quickly. Multitudes followed Him, hoping for relief from their sicknesses. But when the Savior looked upon the multitudes, He saw more than their physical ailments. Filled with compassion, He saw “sheep having no shepherd” (\nMatthew 9:36\n). “The harvest truly is plenteous,” He observed, “but the labourers are few” (\nMatthew 9:37\n). So He called twelve Apostles, “gave them power,” and sent them to teach and minister “to the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (\nMatthew 10:1, 6\n). Today the need for more laborers to serve Heavenly Father’s children is just as great. There are still twelve Apostles, but there are more disciples of Jesus Christ than ever before—people who can declare to all the world, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand” (\nMatthew 10:7\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 9:18–26\n;\nMark 5:22–43\n“Be not afraid, only believe.”\nWhen Jairus first asked Jesus to heal his daughter, who was “at the point of death,” Jairus spoke urgently but hopefully: “Come and lay thy hands on her, … and she shall live” (\nMark 5:23\n).

They often emphasized strict rules over eternal truths. Rules about the Sabbath day, which was meant to be a day of rest, were themselves a heavy burden.\nAnd then, Jehovah Himself came among His people. He taught them that the true purpose of religion is not to create burdens but to relieve them. He taught that God gives us commandments, including the one to honor the Sabbath, not to oppress us but to bless us. Yes, the way to God is strait and narrow, but the Lord came to announce that we need not walk it alone. “Come unto me,” He pleaded. His invitation, to all who feel “heavy laden” for any reason, is to stand beside Him, to bind ourselves to Him, and to let Him share our burdens. His promise is “Ye shall find rest unto your souls.” Compared to the alternatives—trying to carry on alone or relying on mortal solutions—His “yoke is easy, and [His] burden is light.” (\nMatthew 11:28–30\n.)\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 11:28–30\nJesus Christ will give me rest as I rely on Him.\nWe all carry burdens—some resulting from our own sins and mistakes, some caused by the choices of others, and some that are nobody’s fault but are simply part of life on earth. Regardless of the reasons for our struggles, Jesus pleads with us to come unto Him so He can help us bear our burdens and find relief (see also\nMosiah 24\n). Elder David A. Bednar taught, “Making and keeping sacred covenants yokes us to and with the Lord Jesus Christ” (“\nBear Up Their Burdens with Ease\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2014, 88).

      "plain_text": "“March 20–26. Matthew 13; Luke 8; 13: ‘Who Hath Ears to Hear, Let Him Hear,’”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: New Testament 2023\n(2022)\n“March 20–26. Matthew 13; Luke 8; 13,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nMarch 20–26\nMatthew 13\n;\nLuke 8\n;\n13\n“Who Hath Ears to Hear, Let Him Hear”\nAs you read\nMatthew 13\nand\nLuke 8\n;\n13\n, think about how you will prepare yourself to “hear” and appreciate the Savior’s teachings in these parables. What will you do to apply these teachings in your life?\nRecord Your Impressions\nSome of the Savior’s most memorable teachings were in the form of simple stories called parables. These were more than just interesting anecdotes about ordinary objects or events. They contained profound truths about the kingdom of God for those who were spiritually prepared. One of the first parables recorded in the New Testament—the parable of the sower (see\nMatthew 13:3–23\n)—invites us to examine our readiness to receive God’s word. “For whosoever receiveth,” Jesus declared, “to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance” (Joseph Smith Translation, Matthew 13:10 [in\nMatthew 13:12, footnote\na\n]). So as we prepare to study the Savior’s parables—or any of His teachings—a good place to start is to examine our hearts and determine whether we are giving the word of God “good ground” (\nMatthew 13:8\n) in which to grow, blossom, flourish, and produce fruit that will bless us and our families in abundance.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 13:3–23\n;\nLuke 8:4–15\n;\n13:6–9\nMy heart must be prepared to receive the word of God.\nWhy is it that sometimes our hearts are receptive to truth, while at other times we’re tempted to resist it? Reading the parable of the sower can provide a good opportunity to think about how well you receive truth from the Lord. It might be helpful to match\nverses 3–8 of Matthew 13\nwith the interpretations provided in\nverses 18–23\n. What can you do to cultivate “good ground” in yourself? What might be some “thorns” that keep you from truly hearing and following God’s word? How can you overcome these “thorns”?\nYour study of this parable could also influence how you read the parable in\nLuke 13:6–9\n. What is the “fruit” that the Lord seeks from us? How do we nourish our ground so we will “bear fruit”?\nSee also\nMosiah 2:9\n;\nAlma 12:10–11\n;\n32:28–43\n; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nThe Parable of the Sower\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2015, 32–35.\nMatthew 13:24–35, 44–52\n;\nLuke 13:18–21\nJesus’s parables help me understand the growth and destiny of His Church.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith taught that the parables in\nMatthew 13\ndescribe the growth and destiny of the Church in the latter days.

Matthew 14; Mark 6; John 5–6,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nMarch 27–April 2\nMatthew 14\n;\nMark 6\n;\nJohn 5–6\n“Be Not Afraid”\nAs you read\nMatthew 14\n;\nMark 6\n; and\nJohn 5–6\n, look for truths that are meaningful to you. You might ask yourself questions such as “How do the accounts in these chapters relate to me?” “What messages do I find for my life?” or “What would I like to share with my family or with others?”\nRecord Your Impressions\nWhat could have inspired Peter to leave the safety of his boat in the middle of the Sea of Galilee during a boisterous storm? What led him to believe that if Jesus could walk on water, he could too? We can’t know for certain, but perhaps Peter understood that the Son of God came not just to do wonderful things for the people but to empower people like Peter to do wonderful things too. Jesus’s invitation, after all, was “Come, follow me” (\nLuke 18:22\n). Peter had accepted this invitation once, and he was willing to accept it again, even if it meant facing his fears and doing something that seemed impossible. Perhaps the Lord will not ask us to step out of a boat in the middle of a storm or contribute our meager supply of bread when thousands need to eat, but He may ask us to accept directions even when we don’t fully understand them. Whatever His invitations to us may be, they may sometimes seem surprising or even frightening. But miracles can happen if we, like Peter, will set aside our fears, our doubts, and our limited understanding and follow Him in faith.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nJohn 5:16–47\nJesus Christ honors His Father.\nThe relationship between Heavenly Father and each of His children is meant to be a sacred one. In these verses, Jesus Christ gave us an inspiring model to follow in our relationship with Heavenly Father. Read\nJohn 5:16–47\n, and mark or note each instance of the word\nFather\n. How does the Son honor the Father, and how can you follow His example? What do you learn about how the Father feels about the Son? What are you inspired to do to strengthen your relationship with your Heavenly Father?\nSee also\nJohn 17\n; Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nThe Grandeur of God\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2003, 70–73.\nJesus miraculously fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fishes.\nMatthew 14:15–21\n;\nMark 6:33–44\n;\nJohn 6:5–14\nThe Savior can magnify my humble offerings to accomplish His purposes.\nHave you ever felt inadequate to meet all the needs you see around you—in your home, in your relationships, or in society? Jesus’s disciples must have felt inadequate when He asked them to feed over five thousand hungry people when there were only five loaves of bread and two fish available. As you read about the miracle that happened next, ponder how God might use your humble offerings of service to bless those around you. How has He magnified your efforts as you have served Him? Consider this statement from Sister Michelle D. Craig: “You and I can give what we have to Christ, and He will multiply our efforts. What you have to offer is more than enough—even with your human frailties and weaknesses—\nif\nyou rely on the grace of God” (“\nDivine Discontent\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 54).\nMatthew 14:22–33\n;\nMark 6:45–52\n;\nJohn 6:15–21\nJesus Christ invites me to set aside my fears and doubts and exercise faith in Him.\nPicture in your mind the details of the scene described in\nMatthew 14:22–33\n;\nMark 6:45–52\n; and\nJohn 6:15–21\n. Imagine how Peter and the other disciples may have felt. What do you learn about discipleship from the Savior’s words and actions in these verses? What do you learn from the words and actions of Peter? (See also\n1 Nephi 3:7\n.) What is the Lord inviting you to do that might be like stepping out of the boat? What do you find in these verses that gives you courage to exercise your faith in Jesus Christ?\nJohn 6:22–71\nAs a disciple of Jesus Christ, I must be willing to believe and accept the truth, even when it is hard to do.\nWhen Jesus referred to Himself as the “bread of life” (\nJohn 6:48\n), many found this to be a “hard saying” (\nJohn 6:60\n). How can Peter’s words in\nJohn 6:68–69\nhelp you during times when the Savior’s doctrine seems hard to accept or live by? What impresses you about Peter’s testimony? What are some “words of eternal life” (\nJohn 6:68\n) that help you stay committed to following the Savior?\nSee also M. Russell Ballard, “\nTo Whom Shall We Go?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 90–92.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMatthew 14:15–21\n.\nConsider how you might help your family imagine how much bread and fish it would take to feed five thousand people. What does the miracle in\nMatthew 14:15–21\nteach us about the Savior? Consider sharing an experience when you felt you didn’t have enough to offer and the Savior multiplied your efforts.\nMatthew 14:22–33\n.\nYour family might enjoy reenacting the story in these verses. Why would the disciples have been scared? Why was Peter able to overcome his fear and leave the boat? How did he show faith even when he began to sink? How are we sometimes like Peter?\nJohn 5:1–16\n.\nInvite family members to note instances of the phrase “made whole” in these verses. In what ways can Jesus Christ make people whole? When and how has He made us whole?\nJohn 6:28–58\n.\nGive each family member a piece of bread to eat, and discuss the benefits we receive from bread and other healthy foods. Then search these verses together, looking for why Jesus Christ called Himself the “bread of life” (\nJohn 6:35\n). What might it mean to “eat” the bread of life? (see D. Todd Christofferson, “\nThe Living Bread Which Came Down from Heaven\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 36–39).\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested hymn: “\nHow Great the Wisdom and the Love\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 195.\nImproving Personal Study\nSeek your own spiritual insights.\nIn your personal and family study, do not limit yourself to the scripture passages addressed in these outlines. The Lord likely has messages for you in these chapters that are not covered here. Prayerfully seek them.\nAgainst the Wind\n, by Liz Lemon Swindle"

They prepared meals, sang songs, and gathered together to remember the deliverance of the house of Israel from slavery to the Egyptians. Families listened to the story of the destroying angel passing over the homes of their ancestors who had marked their doors with lamb’s blood. Amid all these celebrations so rich with the symbolism of deliverance, relatively few were aware that Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, was about to deliver them from the slavery of sin and death—through His suffering, His death, and His Resurrection. Even so, there were those who recognized Jesus as their promised Messiah, their eternal Deliverer. From that time onward, disciples of Jesus Christ have borne witness to all the world “that Christ died for our sins … ; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day” (\n1 Corinthians 15:3–4\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 21–28\nJesus Christ delivers me from sin and death, strengthens me in my weaknesses, and comforts me in my trials.\nOne way to focus on the blessings of the Savior’s Atonement this week is to spend time each day reading about the last week of Jesus’s life (a possible reading schedule follows).

One of the Holy Ghost’s important missions is to testify of Jesus Christ. As you read the scriptures this week, pay attention to spiritual feelings that strengthen your testimony of the Savior.\nRecord Your Impressions\nIsn’t it strange that the Pharisees and Sadducees would demand that Jesus show them “a sign from heaven”? Weren’t His many well-known miracles enough? What about His powerful teachings or the multiple ways He had fulfilled ancient prophecies? Their demand was prompted not by a lack of signs but by an unwillingness to “discern the signs” and accept them. (See\nMatthew 16:1–4\n.)\nPeter, like the Pharisees and Sadducees, witnessed the Savior’s miracles and heard His teachings. But Peter’s definitive testimony, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,” did not come through his physical senses—his “flesh and blood.” His testimony was revealed to him by our “Father which is in heaven.”\nRevelation\nis the rock upon which the Savior built His Church then and now—revelation from heaven to His servants. And this is the rock upon which we can build our discipleship—revelation that Jesus is the Christ and that His servants hold “the keys of the kingdom.” When we are built upon this foundation, “the gates of hell shall not prevail against [us]” (\nMatthew 16:15–19\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 16:13–17\nA testimony of Jesus Christ comes by revelation.\nIf Jesus Christ asked people today, “Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am?” what might they say?

        "Peter’s suggestion that he could forgive someone seven times might seem very generous, but Jesus taught a higher law. His response, “I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven” ( verse 22 ), was teaching not about numbers but rather about developing a Christlike attitude of forgiveness. As you read the parable of the unmerciful servant, ponder the times when you have felt God’s mercy and compassion. Is there someone who needs to feel mercy and compassion from you?",
        "Elder David E. Sorensen gave this important caution: “Although we must forgive a neighbor who injures us, we should still work constructively to prevent that injury from being repeated. … Forgiveness does not require us to accept or tolerate evil. … But as we fight against sin, we must not allow hatred or anger to control our thoughts or actions” (“ Forgiveness Will Change Bitterness to Love ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2003, 12).",

Recording your impressions can help you make a plan to act on them.\nRecord Your Impressions\nAlthough Jesus Christ came to bring “peace [and] good will toward men” (\nLuke 2:14\n), there was “a division among the people because of him” (\nJohn 7:43\n). People who witnessed the same events came to very different conclusions about who Jesus was. Some concluded, “He is a good man,” while others said, “He deceiveth the people” (\nJohn 7:12\n). When He healed a blind man on the Sabbath, some insisted, “This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day,” while others asked, “How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?” (\nJohn 9:16\n). Yet despite all the confusion, those who searched for truth recognized the power in His words, for “never man spake like this man” (\nJohn 7:46\n). When the Jews asked Jesus to “tell us plainly” whether he was the Christ, He revealed a principle that can help us distinguish truth from error: “My sheep hear my voice,” He said, “and I know them, and they follow me” (\nJohn 10:24, 27\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nJohn 7:14–17\nAs I live the truths taught by Jesus Christ, I will come to know they are true.\nThe Jews marveled that Jesus knew so much, since He was not learned (see\nverse 15\n)—at least, not in ways they were familiar with.

Luke 12–17; John 11,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nThe Prodigal Son\n, by Liz Lemon Swindle\nMay 1–7\nLuke 12–17\n;\nJohn 11\n“Rejoice with Me; for I Have Found My Sheep Which Was Lost”\nAs you read\nLuke 12–17\nand\nJohn 11\n, prayerfully seek what Heavenly Father wants you to know and do. Your study of these chapters can open your heart to messages meant just for you.\nRecord Your Impressions\nIn most situations, 99 out of 100 would be considered excellent—but not when such numbers stand for beloved children of God (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:10\n). In that case, even one soul merits a thorough, desperate search “until [we] find it” (\nLuke 15:4\n), as the Savior taught in the parable of the lost sheep. Then the rejoicing can begin, for “joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance” (\nLuke 15:7\n). If that seems unfair, it’s helpful to remember that, in truth, there are none who “need no repentance.” We all need rescuing. And we all can participate in the rescue, rejoicing together over every soul who is saved (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:15–16\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nLuke 12\n;\n14–16\nI am blessed as I set my heart on eternal things.\nWhy would God say “Thou fool” to a hardworking, successful man who had built great barns and filled them with the fruits of his labors? (see\nLuke 12:16–21\n). In these chapters in Luke, the Savior teaches several parables that can help us lift our sights beyond the worldly to the eternal. Some of these parables are listed here. How would you summarize the message of each? What do you think the Lord is telling you?\nThe foolish rich man (\nLuke 12:13–21\n)\nThe great supper (\nLuke 14:12–24\n)\nThe prodigal son (\nLuke 15:11–32\n)\nThe unjust steward (\nLuke 16:1–12\n)\nThe rich man and Lazarus (\nLuke 16:19–31\n)\nSee also\nMatthew 6:19–34\n;\n2 Nephi 9:30\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 25:10\n.\nLuke 15\nHeavenly Father rejoices when those who are lost are found.\nAs you read the parables Jesus taught in\nLuke 15\n, what do you learn about how Heavenly Father feels about those who have sinned or are otherwise “lost”? How should a spiritual leader—or any of us—feel toward them? Consider how the Pharisees and scribes would have answered these questions (see\nLuke 15:1–2\n). Jesus’s response can be found in three parables in\nLuke 15\n. As you read, think about what Jesus was teaching the scribes and Pharisees with these parables.\nYou might also consider making a list of similarities and differences between the parables. For example, you could identify what was lost in each parable and why it was lost, how it was found, and how people reacted when it was found. What messages did Jesus have for those who are “lost”—including those who don’t think they are lost? What messages did He have for people who seek those who are lost?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 18:10–16\n; Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nThe Other Prodigal\n,”\nEnsign\n, May 2002, 62–64.\nThe Lost Piece of Silver\n, by James Tissot\nLuke 16:1–12\nWhat was Christ teaching in the parable of the unjust steward?\nElder James E. Talmage explained one lesson we can learn from the parable: “Be diligent; for the day in which you can use your earthly riches will soon pass. Take a lesson from even the dishonest and the evil; if they are so prudent as to provide for the only future they think of, how much more should you, who believe in an eternal future, provide therefor! If you have not learned wisdom and prudence in the use of ‘unrighteous mammon,’ how can you be trusted with the more enduring riches?” (\nJesus the Christ\n[1916],\n464\n). What other lessons do you find in this parable?\nLuke 17:11–19\nGratitude for my blessings will bring me closer to God.\nIf you had been one of the ten lepers, do you think you would have returned to thank the Savior? What additional blessings did the thankful leper receive because he gave thanks?\nYou might also ponder the Savior’s words, “Thy faith hath made thee whole” (\nverse 19\n). In your opinion, how are gratitude and faith related? How do both help us become whole? The video “President Russell M. Nelson on the Healing Power of Gratitude” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n) can help you ponder these questions.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson on the Healing Power of Gratitude\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nConsider the Goodness and Greatness of God\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 41–44.\nJohn 11:1–46\nJesus Christ is the Resurrection and the Life.\nThe miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead was a powerful and irrefutable testimony that Jesus was truly the Son of God and the promised Messiah. What words, phrases, or details in\nJohn 11:1–46\nstrengthen your faith that Jesus Christ is “the resurrection, and the life”? What does it mean to you that Jesus is “the resurrection, and the life”?\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nLuke 15:1–10\n.\nDo your family members understand what it feels like to lose something—or to be lost?

When a certain rich young man met the Savior for the first time, he asked, “What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” (\nMatthew 19:16\n). The Savior’s response showed both appreciation for the good things the young man had already done and loving encouragement to do more. When we ponder the possibility of eternal life, we may similarly wonder if there’s more we should be doing. When we ask, in our own way, “What lack I yet?” (\nMatthew 19:20\n), the Lord can give us answers that are just as personal as His response to the rich young man. Whatever the Lord asks us to do, acting on His answer will always require that we trust Him more than our own righteousness (see\nLuke 18:9–14\n) and that we “receive the kingdom of God as a little child” (\nLuke 18:17\n; see also\n3 Nephi 9:22\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 19:3–9\n;\nMark 10:2–12\nMarriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.\nThis interchange between the Savior and the Pharisees is one of the few recorded instances in which the Savior taught specifically about marriage. After reading\nMatthew 19:3–9\nand\nMark 10:2–12\n, make a list of several statements that you feel summarize the Lord’s views on marriage. Then study some of the resources found in “\nMarriage\n” (Gospel Topics,\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n), and add more statements to your list. How does your knowledge of the Father’s plan of salvation affect the way you think and feel about marriage?\nMatthew 19:3–9\n;\nMark 10:2–12\nDid Jesus teach that divorce is never acceptable or that divorced people should not remarry?\nIn an address on divorce, President Dallin H. Oaks taught that Heavenly Father intends for the marriage relationship to be eternal. However, God also understands that divorce is sometimes necessary. President Oaks explained that the Lord “permits divorced persons to marry again without the stain of immorality specified in the higher law. Unless a divorced member has committed serious transgressions, he or she can become eligible for a temple recommend under the same worthiness standards that apply to other members” (“\nDivorce\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2007, 70).\nMatthew 19:16–22\n;\nMark 10:17–22\n;\nLuke 18:18–23\nIf I ask the Lord, He will teach me what I need to do to inherit eternal life.\nThe account of the rich young man can give pause even to the faithful, lifelong disciple. As you read\nMark 10:17–22\n, what evidence do you find of the young man’s faithfulness and sincerity? How did the Lord feel toward this young man?\nThis account may prompt you to ask, “What lack I yet?” (\nMatthew 19:20\n). How does the Lord help us make up for what we lack? (see\nEther 12:27\n). What can we do to prepare ourselves to accept His correction and help as we seek to improve?\nSee also Larry R. Lawrence, “\nWhat Lack I Yet?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2015, 33–35; S. Mark Palmer, “\nThen Jesus Beholding Him Loved Him\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 114–16.\nMatthew 20:1–16\nEveryone can receive the blessing of eternal life, no matter when they accept the gospel.\nCan you relate to the experience of any of the laborers in the vineyard? What lessons do you find for yourself in this passage? Elder Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “\nThe Laborers in the Vineyard\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2012, 31–33) might help you see new ways to apply this parable. What additional promptings does the Spirit give to you?\nThe Repentant Publican and the Self-Righteous Pharisee in the Temple\n, by Frank Adams\nLuke 18:9–14\nI should trust God’s mercy, not my own righteousness.\nHow would you summarize the differences between the two prayers in this parable? Ponder what you feel you should do to be more like the publican in this story and less like the Pharisee.\nSee also\nPhilippians 4:11–13\n;\nAlma 31:12–23\n;\n32:12–16\n.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMark 10:13–16\n;\nLuke 18:15–17\n.\nTo help family members ponder the account in these verses, you could sing together a related song, such as “\nI Think When I Read That Sweet Story\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 56). What might it have been like to be among the children Jesus blessed? What might it mean to “receive the kingdom of God as a little child”? (\nMark 10:15\n).\nMark 10:23–27\n.\nWhat is the difference between\nhaving\nriches and\ntrusting in\nriches? (see\nMark 10:23–24\n). As you read\nverse 27\n, you may want to point out the Joseph Smith Translation: “With men\nthat trust in riches,\nit is impossible; but not\nimpossible with men who trust in God and leave all for my sake,\nfor with\nsuch\nall\nthese\nthings are possible” (Joseph Smith Translation, Mark 10:26 [in\nMark 10:27, footnote\na\n]). As a family, how are we showing that we trust God more than material things?\nMatthew 20:1–16\n.\nTo illustrate the principles in\nMatthew 20:1–16\n, you might set up a simple competition, such as a short race. After everyone has completed the competition, award everyone the same prize, starting with the person who finished last and ending with the person who finished first. What does this teach us about who receives the blessings of eternal life in Heavenly Father’s plan?\nMatthew 20:25–28\n;\nMark 10:42–45\n.\nWhat is the meaning of the phrase “whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant”? (\nMatthew 20:27\n). How did Jesus Christ exemplify this principle? How can we follow His example in our family, our ward or branch, and our neighborhood?\nLuke 18:1–14\n.\nWhat do we learn about prayer from the two parables in these verses?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested hymn: “\nDearest Children, God Is Near You\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 96.\nImproving Personal Study\nFind a time that works for you.\nIt is often easiest to learn when you can study the scriptures without being interrupted.

Record impressions that you could share with your family or in your Church classes.\nRecord Your Impressions\nThe Savior was hungry after traveling from Bethany to Jerusalem, and a fig tree in the distance looked like a source of food. But as Jesus approached the tree, He found that it bore no fruit (see\nMatthew 21:17–20\n;\nMark 11:12–14, 20\n). In a way, the fig tree was like the hypocritical religious leaders in Jerusalem: their empty teachings and outward demonstrations of holiness gave no spiritual nourishment. The Pharisees and scribes appeared to keep many commandments yet missed the two greatest commandments: to love God and to love thy neighbor as thyself (see\nMatthew 22:34–40\n;\n23:23\n).\nIn contrast, many people had begun to recognize good fruit in Jesus’s teachings. When He arrived at Jerusalem, they welcomed Him with branches cut from trees to pave His path, rejoicing that at long last, as ancient prophecy said, “Thy King cometh” (\nZechariah 9:9\n). As you read this week, think about the fruits of the Savior’s teachings and atoning sacrifice in your life and how you can bring “forth much fruit” (\nJohn 12:24\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nLuke 19:1–10\nThe Lord judges not by the outward appearance but by the desires of the heart.\nIn Jesus’s day, many people assumed that the publicans, or tax collectors, were dishonest and stole from the people.

The Savior’s answers revealed that the great destruction coming to Jerusalem—a prophecy fulfilled in AD 70—would be relatively small compared to the signs of His coming in the last days. Things that seem even more stable than the temple in Jerusalem will prove to be temporary—the sun, the moon, the stars, the nations, and the sea. Even “the powers of heaven shall be shaken” (\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:33\n). If we are spiritually aware, this commotion can teach us to put our trust in something truly permanent. As Jesus promised, “Heaven and earth shall pass away; yet my words shall not pass away. … And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived” (\nJoseph Smith—Matthew 1:35, 37\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWhat is Joseph Smith—Matthew?\nJoseph Smith—Matthew, located in the Pearl of Great Price, is the Joseph Smith Translation of the last verse of\nMatthew 23\nand all of\nMatthew 24\n.

Matthew 26; Mark 14; John 13,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nIn Remembrance of Me\n, by Walter Rane\nMay 29–June 4\nMatthew 26\n;\nMark 14\n;\nJohn 13\n“In Remembrance”\nAs you read about the events described in\nMatthew 26\n;\nMark 14\n; and\nJohn 13\n, pay attention to any impressions you receive, especially those impressions that deepen your faith in Jesus Christ and your commitment to Him.\nRecord Your Impressions\nThe day before He died, Jesus gave His disciples something to remember Him by. He “took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood” (\nMatthew 26:26–28\n).\nThat happened about 2,000 years ago, in a place most of us will never see, in a language few of us can understand. But now, every Sunday in our own meeting places, priesthood holders, authorized to act in the name of Jesus Christ, do what He once did. They take bread and water, bless it, and give it to each of us, His disciples. It’s a simple act—can there be anything simpler, more fundamental, than eating bread and drinking water? But that bread and water are sacred to us because they help us remember Him. They’re our way of saying, “I’ll never forget Him”—not just, “I’ll never forget what I’ve read about His teachings and His life.” Rather, we are saying, “I’ll never forget what He did for me.” “I’ll never forget how He rescued me when I cried out for help.” And “I’ll never forget His commitment to me and my commitment to Him—the covenant we have made.”\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 26:6–13\n;\nMark 14:3–9\n“She is come … to anoint my body to the burying.”\nWith a humble act of worship, the woman described in these verses showed that she knew who Jesus was and what He was about to do (see\nMatthew 26:12\n). Why do you think her actions were so meaningful to the Savior? (see\nverse 13\n). What impresses you about the woman and her faith? Ponder how you can follow her example.\nSee also\nJohn 12:1–8\n.\nMatthew 26:20–22\n;\nMark 14:17–19\n“Lord, is it I?”\nWhat do you learn about the disciples from their question to the Lord in these verses?

John 14–17,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nThe Last Supper\n, by William Henry Margetson\nJune 5–11\nJohn 14–17\n“Continue Ye in My Love”\nAs you read the Savior’s teachings in\nJohn 14–17\n, the Holy Ghost will help you identify messages for you. Record the impressions you receive.\nRecord Your Impressions\nToday we call it the “Last Supper,” but we don’t know if Jesus’s disciples fully realized, when they gathered for the annual Passover feast, that this would be their last meal with their Master before His death. Jesus, however, “knew that his hour was come” (\nJohn 13:1\n). He would soon face the suffering of Gethsemane, the betrayal and denial of His closest friends, and an agonizing death on the cross. Yet even with all of this looming before Him, Jesus’s focus was not on Himself but on His disciples. What would they need to know in the days and years ahead? Jesus’s tender teachings in\nJohn 14–17\nreveal how He feels about His disciples, then and now. Among the many comforting truths He shared was the reassurance that, in one sense, He will never leave us. “If ye keep my commandments,” He promised, “ye shall abide in my love” (\nJohn 15:10\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nJohn 14–15\nI show my love for Jesus Christ by keeping His commandments.\nAs you read\nJohn 14–15\n, you might note or mark each use of the word\nlove\n. You may notice the word\ncommandments\nrepeated frequently in association with the word\nlove\nin these chapters. What do you learn about the relationship between love and commandments from the Savior’s teachings? What other words and phrases do you find associated with\nlove\nin these chapters?\nPonder how the Savior’s love has influenced you.\nSee also\nJohn 13:34–35\n; D. Todd Christofferson, “\nAbide in My Love\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 48–51.\nThe Last Supper\n, by Clark Kelley Price\nJohn 14–16\nThe Holy Ghost helps me fulfill my purpose as a disciple of Jesus Christ.\nIt must have been heartbreaking for the disciples to hear that their time with the Savior was almost over. They might also have worried about how they would get along without Him. As you read\nJohn 14–16\n, look for what the Savior said to reassure them. In particular, notice what He taught them about the Holy Ghost. What do you learn about the Holy Ghost from the Savior’s words in the following verses?\nJohn 14:16–17, 26\nJohn 15:26\nJohn 16:7–11\nJohn 16:12–15\nWhy did the disciples need this kind of help from the Holy Ghost?

Luke 22; John 18,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nGethsemane Grove\n, by Derek Hegsted\nJune 12–18\nLuke 22\n;\nJohn 18\n“Not My Will, but Thine, Be Done”\nTake your time reading\nLuke 22\nand\nJohn 18\nthis week. Ponder and pray about what you read. Doing this can give the Spirit opportunity to bear witness to your heart that the scriptures are true.\nRecord Your Impressions\nThere were only three mortal witnesses to Jesus Christ’s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane—and they slept through much of it. In that garden and later on the cross, Jesus took upon Himself the sins, pains, and sufferings of every person who ever lived, although almost no one alive at that time knew what was happening. Eternity’s most important events often pass without much worldly attention. But God the Father knew. He heard the pleading of His faithful Son: “Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him” (\nLuke 22:42–43\n). While we were not there to witness this act of selflessness and submission, we\nare\nwitnesses of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Every time we repent and receive forgiveness of our sins, every time we feel the Savior’s strengthening power, we can testify of the reality of what happened in the Garden of Gethsemane.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nLuke 22:31–34, 54–62\n;\nJohn 18:17–27\nConversion is an ongoing process.\nThink about the experiences Peter had with the Savior—the miracles he witnessed and the doctrine he learned. Why then would the Savior say to Peter, “\nWhen\nthou art converted, strengthen thy brethren”? (\nLuke 22:32\n; italics added). As you ponder this, it might help to consider what Elder David A. Bednar taught about the difference between having a testimony and being truly converted (see “\nConverted unto the Lord\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2012, 106–9).\nAs you read about Peter’s experiences in\nLuke 22:31–34, 54–62\n(see also\nJohn 18:17–27\n), think about your own conversion. Have you ever felt so committed that, like Peter, you were “ready to go with [the Savior], both into prison, and to death”? (\nLuke 22:33\n). Why do those feelings sometimes fade? There are daily opportunities to either deny or witness of the Savior; what will you do to be a daily witness of Him? What other lessons do you learn from Peter’s experience?\nAs you continue reading the New Testament, watch for evidence of Peter’s ongoing conversion. Also note ways he accepted the Lord’s charge to “strengthen thy brethren” (\nLuke 22:32\n; see\nActs 3–4\n).\nSee also\nMark 14:27–31\n.\nLuke 22:39–46\nThe Savior suffered for me in Gethsemane.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson invited us to “invest time in learning about the Savior and His atoning sacrifice” (“\nDrawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 40).\nConsider what you will do to accept President Nelson’s invitation. You might start by prayerfully pondering the Savior’s suffering in Gethsemane, as described in these verses, and writing impressions and questions that come to mind.\nFor an even deeper study of the Savior and His Atonement, try searching other scriptures for answers to questions like these:\nWhy was the Savior’s Atonement necessary? (See\n2 Nephi 2:5–10, 17–26\n;\n9:5–26\n;\nAlma 34:8–16\n;\n42:9–26\n.)\nWhat did the Savior experience as He suffered? (See\nIsaiah 53:3–5\n;\nMosiah 3:7\n;\nAlma 7:11–13\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–19\n.)\nHow does Christ’s suffering affect my life? (See\nJohn 10:10–11\n;\nHebrews 4:14–16\n;\n1 John 1:7\n;\nAlma 34:31\n;\nMoroni 10:32–33\n; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nStrengthened by the Atonement of Jesus Christ\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2015, 61–64.)\nOther questions I have:\nAs you learn about what happened in Gethsemane, it might be interesting to know that Gethsemane was a garden of olive trees and included an olive press, used to crush olives and extract oil used for lighting and food as well as healing (see\nLuke 10:34\n). How might the process of extracting olive oil symbolize what the Savior did for us in Gethsemane? For some ideas, see Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nAbide in My Love\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 50–51).\nSee also\nMatthew 26:36–46\n;\nMark 14:32–42\n.\nJohn 18:28–38\nThe Savior’s “kingdom is not of this world.”\nAs a political leader, Pontius Pilate was familiar with the power and kingdoms of this world. But Jesus spoke of a much different kind of kingdom. Thinking back on what you’ve read about the Savior’s life, what evidence do you see that His “kingdom is not of this world”? (\nJohn 18:36\n). Why is it important for you to know this? What else stands out to you about Jesus’s words to Pilate?\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nLuke 22:31–32\n.\nHow might Peter have felt to know that Jesus had prayed for him and his faith? Who can we pray for, “that [their] faith fail not”? (\nverse 32\n).\nLuke 22:39–46\n.\nLearning about the Savior’s suffering in Gethsemane can be a sacred experience for your family. Consider what you can do to create a reverent and worshipful spirit as you study\nLuke 22:39–46\n. You might play or sing together some of your family’s favorite hymns or children’s songs about the Savior. You could look at related artwork or watch a video like “The Savior Suffers in Gethsemane” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). As you read the verses, family members could share passages that are especially meaningful to them—perhaps a passage that helps them feel the Savior’s love (see also\nMatthew 26:36–46\n;\nMark 14:32–42\n). You might also invite them to share their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\nThe Savior Suffers in Gethsemane\nLuke 22:42\n.\nFamily members could share experiences when they learned to say, “Not my will, but thine, be done.”\nLuke 22:50–51\n;\nJohn 18:10–11\n.\nWhat do we learn about Jesus from these verses?\nSuffer Ye Thus Far\n, by Walter Rane\nJohn 18:37–38\n.\nHow would we answer Pilate’s question “What is truth?” (\nverse 38\n).

Seek to feel His love for you as you study about His sacrifice and death.\nRecord Your Impressions\nIn every word and deed, Jesus Christ exemplified pure love—what the Apostle Paul called charity (see\n1 Corinthians 13\n). At no time was this more evident than during the final hours of the Savior’s mortal life. His dignified silence in the face of false accusations demonstrated that He “is not easily provoked” (\n1 Corinthians 13:5\n). His willingness to submit to scourging, mocking, and crucifixion—while restraining His power to end His torments—showed that He “suffereth long” and “beareth all things” (\n1 Corinthians 13:4, 7\n). His compassion toward His mother and His mercy toward His crucifiers—even during His own incomparable suffering—revealed that He “seeketh not [His] own” (\n1 Corinthians 13:5\n). In His final moments on earth, Jesus was doing what He had done throughout His mortal ministry—teaching us by showing us. Indeed, charity is “the pure love of Christ” (\nMoroni 7:47\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 27\n;\nMark 15\n;\nLuke 23\n;\nJohn 19\nJesus Christ’s willingness to suffer shows His love for the Father and for all of us.\nAlthough the Savior had power to call down “legions of angels” (\nMatthew 26:53\n), He voluntarily chose to endure unjust trials, cruel mocking, and unimaginable physical pain. Why did He do it? “Because of his loving kindness,” Nephi testified, “and his long-suffering towards the children of men” (\n1 Nephi 19:9\n).\n“And he bearing his cross went forth into … Golgotha” (\nJohn 19:17\n).\nYou might begin your study of the Savior’s final hours by reading\n1 Nephi 19:9\n. Where in\nMatthew 27\n;\nMark 15\n;\nLuke 23\n; and\nJohn 19\ndo you find examples of each thing that Nephi said Jesus would suffer?\n“[They] judge him to be a thing of naught”\n“They scourge him”\n“They smite him”\n“They spit upon him”\nWhich passages help you feel the Savior’s “loving kindness” toward you? What other thoughts and feelings do you have as you read these accounts? Consider writing them down or sharing them with someone.\nSee also “Jesus Is Condemned before Pilate” and “Jesus Is Scourged and Crucified” (videos),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nJesus Is Condemned before Pilate\nJesus Is Scourged and Crucified\nMatthew 27:27–49, 54\n;\nMark 15:16–32\n;\nLuke 23:11, 35–39\n;\nJohn 19:1–5\nMocking cannot change the truth.\nWhile Jesus had endured mocking throughout His ministry, it grew more intense during His scourging and Crucifixion. But this mocking could not change the truth: Jesus is the Son of God. As you read about the humiliation Jesus endured, think about the opposition and mocking His work faces today. What insights do you gain about enduring opposition? What impresses you about the centurion’s words in\nMatthew 27:54\n?\nMatthew 27:46\n;\nMark 15:34\nJesus Christ suffered alone so I don’t have to.\nDuring one of His most poignant moments on the cross, Jesus, who had always relied on His Heavenly Father, suddenly felt forsaken. Reading about this might lead you to think about times when you’ve felt distant from God. You might ponder how the Savior’s sacrifice on the cross makes it possible for you to overcome that distance. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland testified, “Because Jesus walked such a long, lonely path utterly alone,\nwe\ndo not have to do so. … Trumpeted from the summit of Calvary is the truth that we will never be left alone nor unaided, even if sometimes we may feel that we are” (“\nNone Were with Him\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2009, 88). Consider how the Savior can help you overcome loneliness as you read the rest of Elder Holland’s message.\nLuke 23:34\nThe Savior is our example of forgiveness.\nHow do you feel when you read the Savior’s words in\nLuke 23:34\n? (see the insight provided by the Joseph Smith Translation in\nfootnote\nc\n). Referring to the Savior’s words, President Henry B. Eyring taught: “We must forgive and bear no malice toward those who offend us. The Savior set the example from the cross. … We do not know the hearts of those who offend us” (“\nThat We May Be One\n,”\nEnsign\n, May 1998, 68). How can this verse help you if you have trouble forgiving someone?\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nMatthew 27\n;\nMark 15\n;\nLuke 23\n;\nJohn 19\n.\nTo help your family learn about the events described in these chapters, you could share with them “\nChapter 52: The Trials of Jesus\n” and “\nChapter 53: Jesus Is Crucified\n” (in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 133–38, or the corresponding videos on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Or you could watch together videos depicting these events: “Jesus Is Condemned before Pilate” and “Jesus Is Scourged and Crucified” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). You might invite children to retell the stories in their own words. Family members could share how they feel toward the Savior because of what He suffered for us.\nChapter 52: The Trials of Jesus\nChapter 53: Jesus Is Crucified\nJesus Is Condemned before Pilate\nJesus Is Scourged and Crucified\nMatthew 27:11–26\n;\nMark 15:1–15\n;\nLuke 23:12–25\n;\nJohn 19:1–16\n.\nWhy did Pilate deliver Jesus to be crucified, even though he knew Jesus was innocent? What lessons do we learn from Pilate’s experience about standing up for what we know is right? It might be helpful for your family to role-play scenarios that allow them to practice standing up for what is right.\nMatthew 27:46\n;\nLuke 23:34, 43, 46\n;\nJohn 19:26–28, 30\n.\nPerhaps you could assign each family member to read one or more of the statements the Savior made on the cross, found in these verses. Ask them to share what they learn from these statements about the Savior and His mission.\nMark 15:39\n.\nHow has reading about the Crucifixion strengthened your testimony that Jesus is the “Son of God”?\nJohn 19:25–27\n.\nWhat do we learn from these verses about how we can love and support family members?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested hymn: “\nUpon the Cross of Calvary\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 184.\nImproving Our Teaching\nEmulate the Savior’s life.\n“It is helpful to study the ways the Savior taught—the methods He used and the things He said. But the Savior’s power to teach and lift others came from the way He lived and the kind of person He was. The more diligently you strive to\nlive\nlike Jesus Christ, the more you will be able to\nteach\nlike Him” (\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n13\n).\nChrist on the Cross\n, by Carl Heinrich Bloch"

Who might be blessed by hearing your testimony of this event?\nRecord Your Impressions\nTo many observers, the death of Jesus of Nazareth may have seemed like an ironic end to a remarkable life. Wasn’t this the man who raised Lazarus from the dead? Hadn’t He withstood the murderous threats from the Pharisees time after time? He had demonstrated power to heal blindness, leprosy, and palsy. The very winds and the seas obeyed Him. And yet here He was, hanging from a cross, declaring, “It is finished” (\nJohn 19:30\n). There may have been some sincere surprise in the mocking words “He saved others; himself he cannot save” (\nMatthew 27:42\n). But we know that Jesus’s death was not the end of the story. We know that the silence of the tomb was temporary and that Christ’s saving work was just beginning. He is found today not “among the dead” but among the living (\nLuke 24:5\n). His teachings would not be silenced, for His loyal disciples would preach the gospel in “all nations,” trusting His promise that He would be “with [them] alway, even unto the end of the world” (\nMatthew 28:19–20\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 28\n;\nMark 16\n;\nLuke 24\n;\nJohn 20\nJesus Christ was resurrected.\nIn these passages, you will read about one of the most important events in the history of humankind: the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Talk about someone your family knows who has died, and discuss how the truths in this song bring comfort.\nRoad to Emmaus\n, by Wendy Keller\nMatthew 28:16–20\n;\nMark 16:14–20\n;\nLuke 24:44–53\n.\nIn these verses, what was Jesus asking His Apostles to do? How can we help accomplish this work? Family members could share experiences when they felt “the Lord working with them” to accomplish His purposes (\nMark 16:20\n).\nJohn 21:15–17\n.\nConsider reading these verses while eating together. This could add some meaning to the Savior’s words “feed my sheep.” Based on what Jesus taught about sheep in the New Testament (see, for example,\nMatthew 9:35–36\n;\n10:5–6\n;\n25:31–46\n;\nLuke 15:4–7\n;\nJohn 10:1–16\n), why is feeding sheep a good way to describe serving God’s children? What does this analogy teach about how Heavenly Father and Jesus feel about us?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested song: “\nDid Jesus Really Live Again?\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 64.\nImproving Personal Study\nUse music to invite the Spirit and learn doctrine.\nListening to or singing hymns such as “\nHe Is Risen!\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 199) can invite the Spirit and help you learn about the Savior’s Resurrection.\nThe Resurrected Christ\n, by Walter Rane"

(\nActs 1:10\n). The Church that was founded by the Son of God was now in Peter’s care. The task of leading the effort to “teach all nations” now rested on him (\nMatthew 28:19\n). But if he felt inadequate or afraid, we don’t find any evidence of that in the book of Acts. What we do find are examples of fearless testimony and conversion, miraculous healings, spiritual manifestations, and significant growth for the Church. This was still the Savior’s Church, still led by Him. In fact, the book Acts of the Apostles could also be called the Acts of Jesus Christ through His Apostles. Guided by an outpouring of the Spirit, Peter was no longer the unlearned fisherman Jesus found on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. Nor was he the distraught man who only weeks earlier was weeping bitterly because he had denied that he even knew Jesus of Nazareth.\nIn the book of Acts, you will read powerful declarations about Jesus Christ and His gospel. You will also see how that gospel can change people—including you—into the valiant disciples God knows they can be.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nActs 1:1–8, 15–26\n;\n2:1–42\n;\n4:1–13, 31–33\nJesus Christ directs His Church through the Holy Ghost.\nThe book of Acts records the Apostles’ efforts to establish the Church of Jesus Christ after the Savior’s Ascension.

The suggestions in this outline can help you identify some of the important principles in these chapters, though you may find others in your own study.\nRecord Your Impressions\nIf anyone seemed like an unlikely candidate for conversion, it was probably Saul—a Pharisee who had a reputation for persecuting Christians. So when the Lord told a disciple named Ananias to seek out Saul and offer him a blessing, Ananias was understandably hesitant. “Lord,” he said, “I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints” (\nActs 9:13\n). But the Lord knew Saul’s heart and his potential, and He had a mission in mind for Saul: “He is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel” (\nActs 9:15\n). So Ananias obeyed, and when he found this former persecutor, he called him “Brother Saul” (\nActs 9:17\n). If Saul could change so completely and Ananias could welcome him so freely, then should we ever consider anyone an unlikely candidate for change—including ourselves?\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nActs 6–8\nMy heart needs to be “right in the sight of God.”\nA growing church meant a growing need for disciples to serve in the kingdom.

And yet they failed to recognize the Messiah and rejected Him. How did this happen? Part of the answer may be found in Stephen’s words: “Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost” (\nActs 7:51\n).

Acts 10–15,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nJuly 17–23\nActs 10–15\n“The Word of God Grew and Multiplied”\nRead\nActs 10–15\ncarefully, allowing time for the Spirit to prompt you with thoughts and feelings. What is there for you to learn in these chapters?\nRecord Your Impressions\nDuring His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ often challenged people’s long-held traditions and beliefs. This didn’t stop after He ascended into heaven, as He continued to guide His Church by revelation. For example, during Jesus’s life His disciples preached the gospel only to fellow Jews. But soon after the Savior died and Peter became the leader of the Church on earth, Jesus Christ revealed to Peter that the time was right for the gospel to be preached to non-Jews. The idea of sharing the gospel with Gentiles doesn’t seem surprising today, so what’s the lesson in this account for us? Perhaps one lesson is that in both the ancient and modern Church, a loving Savior guides His chosen leaders (see\nAmos 3:7\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:38\n). Continuing revelation is a vital sign of the true and living Church of Jesus Christ. Like Peter, we must be willing to accept continuing revelation and live “by every word of God” (\nLuke 4:4\n), including “all that [He] has revealed, all that He does now reveal,” and the “many great and important things” He will yet reveal “pertaining to the Kingdom of God” (\nArticles of Faith 1:9\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nActs 10\n“God is no respecter of persons.”\nFor generations, the Jews had believed that being of “the seed of Abraham,” or a literal descendant of Abraham, meant that a person was accepted and chosen by God (see\nLuke 3:8\n). They considered anyone else an “unclean” Gentile who was not accepted by God. In\nActs 10\n, what did the Lord teach Peter about who “is accepted with him”? (\nActs 10:35\n). What evidence do you find in this chapter that Cornelius’s life was acceptable to the Lord? Ponder what is meant by the statement “God is no respecter of persons” (\nverse 34\n; see also\n1 Nephi 17:35\n). Why is it important to you to know this truth?\nLike the Jews who looked down on those who were not of the seed of Abraham, do you ever catch yourself making unkind or uninformed assumptions about someone who is different from you? How can you overcome this tendency? It might be interesting to try a simple activity for the next few days: Whenever you interact with someone, try to think to yourself, “This person is a child of God.” As you do this, what changes do you notice in the way you think about and interact with others?\nSee also\n1 Samuel 16:7\n;\n2 Nephi 26:13, 33\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nLet God Prevail\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 92–95; “Peter’s Revelation to Take the Gospel to the Gentiles” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nPeter's Revelation to Take the Gospel to the Gentiles\nActs 10\n;\n11:1–18\n;\n15\nHeavenly Father teaches me line upon line through revelation.\nWhen Peter saw the vision described in\nActs 10\n, he struggled at first to understand it and “doubted in himself what [it] should mean” (\nverse 17\n). Yet the Lord gave Peter greater understanding as Peter sought it. As you read\nActs 10\n,\n11\n, and\n15\n, notice how Peter’s understanding of his vision deepened over time. How have you sought and received greater understanding from God when you had questions?\nActs 10\n,\n11\n, and\n15\nrecount instances in which the Lord directed His servants through revelation. It might help to record what you learn about revelation as you read these chapters. In what ways does the Spirit speak to you?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nRevelation\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; Quentin L. Cook, “\nThe Blessing of Continuing Revelation to Prophets and Personal Revelation to Guide Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 96–100; “The Jerusalem Conference” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nThe Jerusalem Conference\nActs 11:26\nI am a Christian because I believe in and follow Jesus Christ.\nWhat is significant about a person being called a Christian? (see\nActs 11:26\n). What does it mean to you to be known as a Christian? Consider the significance of names. For instance, what does your family name mean to you? Why is the name of the Church important to you? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 115:4\n). What does it mean to you to take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ by covenant?

Uchtdorf, “\nMissionary Work: Sharing What Is in Your Heart\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 15–18.\nEach of us is a child of God.\nActs 17:16–34\n“We are the offspring of God.”\nIn Athens, Paul found people with diverse opinions and religious views. They were always seeking “to hear some new thing,” and what Paul had to offer was definitely new to them (see\nActs 17:19–21\n). They worshipped many gods, including one they called “the unknown God” (\nActs 17:23\n), but they believed that gods were powers or forces, not living, personal beings, and certainly not our Father. Ponder what Paul said to help them come to know God. What does it mean to you to be the “offspring of God”? (\nActs 17:29\n). In your opinion, how is being a child of God different from being just one of His creations? How does understanding this truth influence how you see yourself and others?\nIf you had stood beside Paul as he was testifying, what would you have told the ancient Greeks about our Heavenly Father? Do you know someone who could benefit from hearing your testimony?\nSee also\nRomans 8:16\n;\n1 John 5:2\n; “We Are the Offspring of God” (video),\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nWe Are the Offspring of God\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nActs 16–21\n.\nTo deepen your family’s understanding of\nActs 16–21\n, you could study the map at the end of this outline, looking for the cities where Paul preached the gospel in these chapters. What resources do we have today to help bring the gospel to all nations?\nTo inspire your family to share the gospel, you could show one or more of the videos in the “\nSharing the Gospel\n” section of the Gospel Library.\nActs 17:10–12\n;\n18:24–28\n.\nHow can we be more like the Saints in these verses? What might it mean to “[receive] the word with all readiness of mind”? (\nActs 17:11\n). What can we do to be “mighty in the scriptures”? (\nActs 18:24\n).\nActs 19:1–7\n.\nThese verses can help your family have a discussion about the importance of being baptized and confirmed. To better understand the truths in\nActs 19:1–7\n, you could discuss some things that are useless without something else, such as a cell phone without a battery. Or you could share this teaching from the Prophet Joseph Smith: “Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half—that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost” (\nTeachings: Joseph Smith\n,\n95\n). Why is baptism “good for nothing” without receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost? (see\n3 Nephi 27:19–20\n;\nMoses 6:59–61\n).\nActs 19:18–20\n.\nAs you read\nActs 19:18–20\n, notice the value of the possessions that the people were willing to give up in order to embrace the gospel (see\nverse 19\n). Are there worldly possessions or activities we need to give up in order to receive heavenly blessings?\nActs 20:32–35\n.\nWhen has your family experienced Christ’s teaching that “it is more blessed to give than to receive”? (\nActs 20:35\n). Is there someone who could benefit from service, time, or gifts that your family could give? As a family, discuss some ideas and make a plan to serve someone. How do we feel when we serve others?

Romans 1–6,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nAugust 7–13\nRomans 1–6\n“The Power of God unto Salvation”\nRecording promptings will help you remember what the Spirit is teaching you. Consider also recording how you feel about these promptings.\nRecord Your Impressions\nBy the time Paul wrote his epistle to Roman Church members, who were a diverse group of Jews and Gentiles, the Church of Jesus Christ had grown far beyond a small band of believers from Galilee. About 20 years after the Savior’s Resurrection, there were congregations of Christians almost everywhere the Apostles could reasonably travel—including Rome, the capital of a powerful empire. Still, compared to the vastness of the Roman empire, the Church was small and often the object of persecution. In such conditions, some might feel “ashamed of the gospel of Christ”—but, of course, not Paul. He knew and testified that true power, “the power of God unto salvation,” is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ (\nRomans 1:16\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWhat are the Epistles, and how are they organized?\nThe Epistles are letters written by Church leaders to Saints in various parts of the world. The Apostle Paul wrote most of the epistles in the New Testament—starting with Romans and ending with Hebrews. His epistles are organized by length, except for Hebrews (see Bible Dictionary, “\nPauline Epistles\n”). Although Romans is the first epistle in the New Testament, it was actually written near the end of Paul’s missionary journeys.\nRomans 1–6\n“The just shall live by faith.”\nThe following definitions may help you better understand the Epistle to the Romans:\nThe law.\nWhen Paul wrote of “the law,” he was referring to the law of Moses. The word “works” in Paul’s writings referred to outward actions associated with the law of Moses. Consider how the law of Moses and the works required under it are different from “the law of faith” described in\nRomans 3:23–31\n.\nCircumcision, uncircumcision.\nAnciently, circumcision was a token or symbol of the covenant God made with Abraham. Paul used the term “circumcision” to refer to Jews (the covenant people) and “uncircumcision” to refer to Gentiles. Ponder what\nRomans 2:25–29\nteaches about what it really means to be God’s covenant people. Note that circumcision is no longer a token of God’s covenant with His people (see\nActs 15:23–29\n).\nJustification, justify, justified.\nThese terms refer to the remission, or pardoning, of sin. When we are justified, we are forgiven, declared guiltless, and freed from eternal punishment for our sins. When you see these terms, notice what Paul taught about what makes justification possible (see also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nJustification, Justify\n,”\nscriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; D. Todd Christofferson, “\nJustification and Sanctification\n,”\nEnsign\n, June 2001, 18–25). In Romans, words like “righteous” and “righteousness” can be seen as synonyms for words like “just” and “justification.”\nGrace.\nGrace is “divine … help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.” Through grace, all people will be resurrected and receive immortality. In addition, “grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts.” We do not earn grace through our efforts; rather, it is grace that gives us “strength and assistance to do good works that [we] otherwise would not be able to maintain” (Bible Dictionary, “\nGrace\n”; see also\n2 Nephi 25:23\n; Dieter F.

Romans 7–16,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nAugust 14–20\nRomans 7–16\n“Overcome Evil with Good”\nOnly a few of the gospel principles in\nRomans 7–16\ncan be included in this outline, so don’t limit yourself to what is addressed here. Pay attention to the inspiration you receive as you study.\nRecord Your Impressions\nAs he opened his epistle to the Romans, Paul greeted Church members by calling them “beloved of God” who were “called to be saints.” He remarked that their “faith [was] spoken of throughout the whole world” (\nRomans 1:7–8\n). Even though Paul spent much of his epistle correcting false ideas and flawed behaviors, it seems he also wanted to assure these new Christian converts that they truly were Saints who were beloved of God. His tender counsel blesses all of us who struggle to feel God’s love and for whom becoming a Saint may feel out of reach. With humble empathy, Paul acknowledged that he had felt like a “wretched man” at times (\nRomans 7:24\n), but the gospel of Jesus Christ had given him power to overcome sin (see\nJoseph Smith Translation, Romans 7:22–27\n[in the Bible appendix]). With that power, the Savior’s redeeming power, we can “overcome evil”—both evil in the world and evil in ourselves—“with good” (\nRomans 12:21\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nRomans 7–8\nThose who follow the Spirit can become “joint-heirs with Christ.”\nEven after entering into “newness of life” through the ordinance of baptism (\nRomans 6:4\n), perhaps you have felt some of the inner conflict Paul described in\nRomans 7\n—the “warring” between the natural man and your righteous desires (\nRomans 7:23\n). But Paul also spoke of hope in\nRomans 8:23–25\n. What reasons for this hope do you find in\nchapter 8\n? You might also look for blessings that come from having “the Spirit of God dwell in you” (\nRomans 8:9\n). How can you seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost more fully in your life?\nRomans 8:16–39\nThe gift of eternal glory far outweighs my trials on earth.\nJust a few years after Paul wrote this epistle, the Saints in Rome suffered horrific persecutions. What do you find in\nRomans 8:16–39\nthat might have helped these Saints when persecution came? How might these words apply to you and the trials you currently face?\nLook for connections between these verses and this counsel from Sister Linda S. Reeves: “I do not know why we have the many trials that we have, but it is my personal feeling that the reward is so great, so eternal and everlasting, so joyful and beyond our understanding that in that day of reward, we may feel to say to our merciful, loving Father, ‘Was that\nall\nthat was required?’ I believe that if we could daily remember and recognize the depth of that love our Heavenly Father and our Savior have for us, we would be willing to do anything to be back in Their presence again, surrounded by Their love eternally. What will it matter … what we suffered here if, in the end, those trials are the very things which qualify us for eternal life and exaltation in the kingdom of God with our Father and Savior?” (“\nWorthy of Our Promised Blessings\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2015, 11). Decide what you will do to “daily remember and recognize” God’s love for you.\nRomans 8:29–30\n;\n9–11\nWhat did Paul mean by “predestinate,” “election,” and “foreknow”?\nPaul used the terms “predestinate,” “election,” and “foreknow” to teach that before this life, God chose some of His children to be part of Israel, His covenant people. This meant they would receive special blessings and responsibilities so they could bless all the people of the world (see Guide to the Scriptures, “\nElection\n,”\nscriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).

These impressions may include promptings to study an idea further, to share with others something you learn, or to make changes in your life.\nRecord Your Impressions\nDuring the months that Paul spent in Corinth, “many of the Corinthians hearing [him] believed, and were baptized” (\nActs 18:8\n). So it must have been heartbreaking for Paul to hear, just a few years later, that there were “divisions” and “contentions” among the Corinthian Saints and that in his absence they began to heed the “wisdom of this world” (\n1 Corinthians 1:10–11, 20\n). In response, Paul wrote the letter we now call 1 Corinthians. It is full of profound doctrine, and yet at the same time, Paul seemed disappointed that the Saints were not ready to receive all the doctrine he wanted to give them. “I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,” he lamented, “for ye are yet carnal” (\n1 Corinthians 3:1–3\n). As we prepare to read Paul’s words, it might be helpful to examine our own readiness to receive truth—including our willingness to heed the Spirit and strive for unity within our families, with our fellow Saints, and with God.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n1 Corinthians 1:10–17\n;\n3:1–11\nThe members of Christ’s Church strive to be united.\nWe don’t know all the details about the lack of unity among the Corinthian Saints, but we do know about lack of unity in our\nown\nrelationships. Think of a relationship in your life that could benefit from more unity; then look for what Paul taught in\n1 Corinthians 1:10–17\n;\n3:1–11\nabout lack of unity among the Corinthian Saints. What insights can you gain about how to develop greater unity with others?\nSee also\nMosiah 18:21\n;\n4 Nephi 1:15–17\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:23–27\n;\n105:1–5\n; Gospel Topics, “\nUnity\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n1 Corinthians 1:17–31\n;\n2\nTo accomplish God’s work, I need the wisdom of God.\nWhile it’s good—even encouraged—to seek wisdom wherever we can find it (see\n2 Nephi 9:29\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 88:118\n), Paul gave some strongly worded warnings about flawed human wisdom, which he called “the wisdom of this world.” As you read\n1 Corinthians 1:17–25\n, ponder what this phrase might mean. What do you think Paul meant by the “wisdom of God”? Why do we need God’s wisdom to accomplish God’s work?\nIn your efforts to fulfill your responsibilities in accomplishing God’s work, have you ever experienced the “fear, and … much trembling” that Paul felt when he taught the Corinthian Saints? (\n1 Corinthians 2:3\n). What do you find in\n1 Corinthians 2:1–5\nthat gives you courage? Consider how you can show that you trust the “power of God” more than “the wisdom of men.”\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:17–28\n.\n1 Corinthians 2:9–16\nI need the Holy Ghost in order to understand the things of God.\nIf you wanted to learn more about something like automotive mechanics or medieval architecture, how would you do it? According to\n1 Corinthians 2:9–16\n, how is learning “the things of God” different from learning the “things of a man”? Why must we have the Holy Ghost in order to understand the things of God? After reading these verses, what do you feel you should do to understand spiritual things more fully? How could Paul’s words help someone who is struggling with his or her testimony?\n1 Corinthians 6:13–20\nMy body is sacred.\nMost people in Corinth felt that sexual immorality was acceptable and that their bodies were made primarily for pleasure. In other words, Corinth was not that different from the world today. What did Paul teach in\n1 Corinthians 6:13–20\nthat could help you explain to others why you want to live a chaste life?\nLike Paul, Sister Wendy W. Nelson encouraged Saints to be chaste; see her message “\nLove and Marriage\n” (worldwide devotional for young adults, Jan. 8, 2017,\nbroadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). According to Sister Nelson, what blessings come from living the Lord’s standards concerning love and intimacy?\nLove and Marriage\n1 Corinthians 7:29–33\nDid Paul teach that it is better to be unmarried than married?\nSeveral verses in\n1 Corinthians 7\nseem to suggest that while marriage is acceptable, remaining single and abstaining completely from sexual relations is preferred. However,\nJoseph Smith Translation, 1 Corinthians 7:29–33\n(in the Bible appendix) helps us understand that Paul was referring to those called to be full-time missionaries, observing that they were able to serve God better if they remained single during their missions. The Lord has taught through His servants, including Paul, that marriage is part of His eternal plan and necessary for exaltation (see\n1 Corinthians 11:11\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 131:1–4\n).\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\n1 Corinthians 1:10–17\n;\n3:1–11\n.\nAs your family members read these verses, invite them to find an insight that can help them be more unified.\n1 Corinthians 3:1–2\n.\nMaybe you could read these verses while eating milk and meat. You could compare the way babies grow into adults with the way we grow spiritually.\n1 Corinthians 3:4–9\n.\nPaul compared his missionary efforts to planting seeds. What does his comparison teach us about sharing the gospel?\n1 Corinthians 6:19–20\n.\nComparing our bodies to temples, as Paul did, can be an effective way to teach about the sacredness of our bodies. Perhaps you could show pictures of temples, such as those that accompany this outline. Why are temples sacred? How are our bodies like temples? What can we do to treat our bodies like temples? (See also the August 2020\nspecial edition\nof the\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\nabout sexuality.)\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested song: “\nThe Lord Gave Me a Temple\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 153.\nImproving Personal Study\nBe patient with yourself.\nPaul taught that milk comes before meat when we are learning the gospel (see\n1 Corinthians 3:1–2\n). If you find that some doctrines are difficult to understand now, be patient. Trust that answers will come as you have faith and diligently study.\nPaul compared our bodies to the sacredness of the temple.

Recording these impressions will help you recall the feelings and thoughts you had during your study.\nRecord Your Impressions\nIn Paul’s time, Corinth was a wealthy trade center with residents from all over the Roman Empire. With so many different cultures and religions in the city, Church members in Corinth struggled to maintain unity, so Paul sought to help them find unity in their belief in Christ. This unity was to be more than just peaceful coexistence; Paul wasn’t asking them merely to tolerate each other’s differences. Rather, he taught that when you join the Church of Jesus Christ, you are “baptized into one body,” and every body part is needed (\n1 Corinthians 12:13\n). When one member is lost, it’s like losing a limb, and the body is weaker as a result. When one member suffers, we should all feel it and do our part to relieve it. In this kind of unity, differences are not just acknowledged but cherished, because without members of diverse gifts and abilities, the body would be limited. So whether you feel like you’ve always been at home in the Church or find yourself wondering if you truly belong, Paul’s message to you is that unity is not sameness. You need your fellow Saints, and your fellow Saints need you.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n1 Corinthians 10:1–13\nGod provides a way to escape temptation.\nSpiritual experiences, even miraculous ones, do not exempt us from temptations that are “common to man” (\n1 Corinthians 10:13\n).

What do these verses suggest about how we should treat each other as family members?\n1 Corinthians 13:4–8\n.\nPaul’s definition of charity might make an inspiring motto for your family. You could assign each family member to study a phrase in\nverses 4–8\nand teach the rest of the family what it means using definitions, examples, and personal experiences. How is the Savior an example of these attributes? You could also make posters together for each of these phrases and display them throughout your house.

Pray about what the Spirit has taught you, and ask Heavenly Father if there is more He would like you to learn.\nRecord Your Impressions\nBecause the Church and its doctrines were relatively new in Corinth, it’s understandable that Corinthian Saints encountered confusion. Paul had previously taught them the fundamental truth of the gospel: “That Christ died for our sins … and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day” (\n1 Corinthians 15:3–4\n). But some members soon began teaching that “there is no resurrection of the dead” (\n1 Corinthians 15:12\n). Paul implored them to “keep in memory” the truths they had been taught (\n1 Corinthians 15:2\n). When we encounter conflicting opinions about gospel truths, it is good to remember that “God is not the author of confusion, but of peace” (\n1 Corinthians 14:33\n). Listening to the Lord’s appointed servants and holding to the simple truths they repeatedly teach can help us find peace and “stand fast in the faith” (\n1 Corinthians 16:13\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n1 Corinthians 14\nI can seek the gift of prophecy.\nWhat is the gift of prophecy?

This was true in Paul’s day just as it is today. Apparently a previous letter from Paul to the Corinthian Saints included chastening and caused hurt feelings. In the letter that became 2 Corinthians, he tried to explain what had motivated his harsh words: “Out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you” (\n2 Corinthians 2:4\n). When you’re on the receiving end of some correction from a leader, it definitely helps to know that it is inspired by Christlike love. And even in those cases where it is not, if we’re willing to see others with the kind of love Paul felt, it’s easier to respond appropriately to any offenses. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland counseled, “Be kind regarding human frailty—your own as well as that of those who serve with you in a Church led by volunteer, mortal men and women. Except in the case of His only perfect Begotten Son, imperfect people are all God has ever had to work with” (“\nLord, I Believe\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2013, 94).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n2 Corinthians 1:3–7\n;\n4:6–10, 17–18\n;\n7:4–7\nMy trials can be a blessing.\nGiven everything Paul faced during his life, it’s not surprising that he wrote a lot about the purposes and blessings of tribulation.

You might write in a study journal, make notes in the margins of your scriptures, add notes in your Gospel Library app, or make an audio recording of your thoughts.\nRecord Your Impressions\nWhat would you do if you heard that a congregation of Saints in another area was struggling in poverty? This was the situation that Paul described to the Corinthian Saints in\n2 Corinthians 8–9\n. He hoped to persuade the Corinthian Saints to donate some of their abundance to Saints in need. But beyond a request for donations, Paul’s words also contain profound truths about giving: “Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver” (\n2 Corinthians 9:7\n). In our day, there\nare\nstill Saints throughout the world who are in need of help. Sometimes the most we can do for them is to fast and donate fast offerings. In other cases, our giving can be more direct and personal. Whatever forms our sacrifices take, it’s worth examining our motivations for giving. Are our sacrifices expressions of love? After all, it’s love that makes a giver cheerful.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n2 Corinthians 8:1–15\n;\n9:5–15\nI can cheerfully share what I have to bless the poor and needy.\nThere are so many people in need all over the world.

Galatians,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nThe resurrected Savior visited Paul in prison (see\nActs 23:11\n). Jesus Christ can free us from the “yoke of bondage” (\nGalatians 5:1\n).\nSeptember 25–October 1\nGalatians\n“Walk in the Spirit”\nAs you read Galatians, record the impressions you receive. Doing so will help you remember and ponder them in the future.\nRecord Your Impressions\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ offers freedom from spiritual bondage. But sometimes people who have experienced the freedom of the gospel turn away from it and “desire again to be in bondage” (\nGalatians 4:9\n). This is what some Galatian Saints were doing—they were turning away from the liberty Christ had offered them (see\nGalatians 1:6\n). Paul’s Epistle to the Galatians, then, was an urgent call to come back to “the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free” (\nGalatians 5:1\n). This call is one we also need to hear and heed because while circumstances change, the struggle between freedom and bondage is constant. As Paul taught, it’s not enough to be “called unto liberty” (\nGalatians 5:13\n); we must also “stand fast” in it (\nGalatians 5:1\n) by relying on Christ.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nGalatians 1–5\nThe law of Christ makes me free.\nPaul wrote to the Galatian Saints when he learned they were being led astray by false teachings (see\nGalatians 1:6–9\n). One of these teachings was that in order to be saved, Gentiles who had accepted the gospel needed to be circumcised and to keep other traditions of the law of Moses (see\nGalatians 2\n). Paul called these traditions the “yoke of bondage” (\nGalatians 5:1\n). As you read Paul’s counsel to the Galatians, look for principles that can help you understand what true freedom is. You could also ponder what false traditions or other yokes of bondage might exist in your life. Is there anything that is preventing you from experiencing the freedom that the gospel offers? How have Christ and His gospel “made [you] free”? (\nGalatians 5:1\n).\nSee also\n2 Nephi 2:27\n;\n9:10–12\n.\nGalatians 3\nI am an heir to the blessings promised to Abraham.\nSome of the Galatian Saints were concerned that because they were not literal descendants (“seed”) of Abraham, they would not receive the blessings promised to Abraham, including exaltation. According to\nGalatians 3:7–9, 13–14, 27–29\n, what qualifies a person to be the “seed of Abraham”?\nTo learn about the blessings promised to Abraham and the blessings that we can inherit as his seed, see Gospel Topics, “\nAbrahamic Covenant\n” (\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Why are the blessings promised to Abraham important to you?\nGalatians 3:6–25\nAbraham had the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThe Prophet Joseph Smith explained: “We cannot believe that the ancients in all ages were so ignorant of the system of heaven as many suppose, since all that were ever saved, were saved through the power of this great plan of redemption, as much so before the coming of Christ as since. … Abraham offered sacrifice, and notwithstanding this, had the Gospel preached to him” (“\nThe Elders of the Church in Kirtland to Their Brethren Abroad\n,”\nThe Evening and the Morning Star\n, Mar. 1834, 143,\nJosephSmithPapers.org\n). Why do you think it was important for the Saints in Paul’s time to know that Abraham and other ancient prophets had the gospel of Jesus Christ? Why is it important to you to know this? (See\nHelaman 8:13–20\n;\nMoses 5:58–59\n;\n6:50–66\n.)\nSee also\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith\n(2007),\n45–56\n.\nGalatians 5:13–26\n;\n6:7–10\nIf I “walk in the Spirit,” I will receive the “fruit of the Spirit.”\nStudying these verses can help you evaluate how fully you are walking in the Spirit. Are you experiencing the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in\nverses 22–23\n? What other fruit, or results, of spiritual living have you noticed? Ponder what you need to do to cultivate this fruit more fully. How might cultivating this fruit improve the important relationships in your life?\nI must seek the “fruit of the Spirit” in my life.\nIf you are trying to walk in the Spirit but your efforts don’t seem to be bearing the promised fruit, read\nGalatians 6:7–10\n. What message do you feel the Lord has for you in these verses?\nSee also\nAlma 32:28, 41–43\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:32–34\n.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nGalatians 3:11\n.\nWhat does it mean to “live by faith”? How are we living by faith as a family?\nGalatians 4:1–7\n.\nYou might introduce\nGalatians 4\nby discussing the differences between a king’s servants and his children. What opportunities or potential does a king’s child have that a servant does not? Think about this as you read together\nverses 1–7\n. What do these verses teach about our relationship with Heavenly Father?\nGalatians 5:16–26\n.\nConsider discussing the difference between the “works of the flesh” and the “fruit of the Spirit.” To add some fun to your discussion, your family could label different fruits with words Paul used to describe the fruit of the Spirit. Then each family member could select one, define it, and talk about someone who exemplifies that fruit. This could lead to a discussion about ways your family could invite the Spirit into your home and cultivate this fruit. After the discussion, you could enjoy a fruit salad together.\nGalatians 6:1–2\n.\nThere may be times when someone in your family is “overtaken in a fault.” What counsel do you find in\nGalatians 6:1–2\nabout what to do in such a situation?\nGalatians 6:7–10\n.\nIf your family has ever planted something together, you could use that experience to illustrate the principle “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap” (\nverse 7\n). Or you could ask family members about their favorite fruits or vegetables and talk about what it takes to grow a plant that produces that food. (See the picture at the end of this outline.)

Local craftsmen who produced shrines to a pagan goddess saw Christianity as a threat to their livelihood, and soon “they were full of wrath, … and the whole city was filled with confusion” (see\nActs 19:27–29\n). Imagine being a new convert to the gospel in such a setting. Many Ephesians did accept and live the gospel amid this “uproar” (\nActs 19:40\n), and Paul assured them that “Christ … is our peace” (\nEphesians 2:13–14\n). These words, along with his invitation to “let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away” (\nEphesians 4:31\n), seem as timely and comforting now as they were then. For the Ephesians, as for each of us, the strength to face adversity comes “in the Lord, and in the power of his might” (see\nEphesians 6:10–13\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nEphesians 1:4–11, 17–19\nGod chose, or foreordained, me to fulfill certain responsibilities on earth.\nPaul spoke of the Saints being “predestinated” by God and “chosen … before the foundation of the world” to be His people.

All of God’s children can accept the gospel and its ordinances because of the work performed for the dead in holy temples.\nAlthough no one is predestined to be saved or not saved, modern revelation teaches that some of God’s children were chosen, or “foreordained,” in the premortal world to fulfill certain responsibilities in accomplishing God’s purposes on earth. As you read\nEphesians 1\nand Gospel Topics, “\nForeordination\n” (\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n), ponder how this truth applies to you.\nEphesians 1:10\nGod will “gather together in one all things in Christ.”\nWhy do you think our day is called “the dispensation of the fulness of times”? What might it mean to “gather together in one all things in Christ”? As you ponder these phrases, read the following scriptures:\nEphesians 4:13\n;\n2 Nephi 30:7–8\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 110:11–16\n;\n112:30–32\n;\n128:18–21\n. You may feel inspired to write your own explanations of these phrases.\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nGather Together in One All Things in Christ\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 21–24.\nEphesians 2:19–22\n;\n3:1–7\n;\n4:11–16\nThe Church is founded on apostles and prophets, and Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone.\nAccording to\nEphesians 2:19–22\n;\n3:1–7\n;\n4:11–16\n, why do we have prophets and apostles? Think about the messages from prophets and apostles you heard during general conference. How do their teachings fulfill the purposes Paul described? For example, how have these teachings helped you not be “carried about with every wind of doctrine”?\nHow is Jesus Christ like a cornerstone for the Church? How is He like a cornerstone for your life?\nSee also\nActs 4:10–12\n.\nJesus Christ is the cornerstone of the Church.\nEphesians 5:21–33\n;\n6:1–4\nFollowing the Savior’s example can strengthen my family relationships.\nAs you read\nEphesians 5:21–33\n;\n6:1–4\n, think about how the counsel in these verses could strengthen your family relationships.\nIt is important to note that Paul’s words in\nEphesians 5:22–24\nwere written in the context of the social customs of his era. Prophets and apostles today teach that men are not superior to women and that spouses are meant to be “equal partners” (see “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n,”\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Even so, you can still find relevant counsel in\nEphesians 5:25–33\n. For example, how does Christ show His love for the Saints? What does this imply about how spouses, as equal partners, should treat each other? What messages do you find for yourself in these verses?\nEphesians 6:10–18\nThe armor of God will help protect me from evil.\nAs you read\nEphesians 6:10–18\n, consider why Paul named each piece of armor the way he did. What does the “whole armour of God” protect you from? What can you do to more fully put on each piece of armor every day?\nSee also\n2 Nephi 1:23\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 27:15–18\n.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nEphesians 1:10\n.\nTo teach about this verse, Elder David A. Bednar used the example of a rope (see “\nGather Together in One All Things in Christ\n”). Consider showing family members a rope and letting them hold and examine it while you share parts of Elder Bednar’s message. How is God gathering all things together in Christ? How are we blessed because of this gathering?\nEphesians 2:4–10\n;\n3:14–21\n.\nInvite family members to share experiences in which they have felt the love and mercy of God and Jesus Christ described in these verses.\nEphesians 2:12–19\n.\nYour family might enjoy building walls out of pillows or other objects you have at home and then knocking them down. While Paul referred to the “wall” between Gentiles and Jews, what kinds of walls separate people today? How has Jesus Christ “broken down” these walls? How does He “reconcile [us] unto God”? (\nverse 16\n).\nEphesians 6:10–18\n.\nYour family could make their own “armour of God” using household items. The video “The Armour of God” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n) can help family members visualize this armor, and they can find simple explanations in “\nThe Whole Armor of God\n” (\nFriend\n, June 2016, 24–25). How does each piece of armor protect us spiritually? What can we do to help each other “put on the whole armour of God” (\nEphesians 6:11\n) every day?\nThe Armor of God\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested hymn: “\nHope of Israel\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 259.\nImproving Personal Study\nLet the Spirit guide your study.\nBe sensitive to the Spirit as He guides you toward the things you need to learn each day, even if this leads you to study a topic that you hadn’t originally planned.\nPutting on the armor of God can protect us spiritually."

Philippians; Colossians: ‘I Can Do All Things through Christ Which Strengtheneth Me,’”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: New Testament 2023\n(2022)\n“October 9–15. Philippians; Colossians,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nOctober 9–15\nPhilippians\n;\nColossians\n“I Can Do All Things through Christ Which Strengtheneth Me”\nWhen was the last time you read the spiritual impressions you have recorded during your study of the New Testament? It might be helpful to review the promptings you’ve been receiving.\nRecord Your Impressions\nPaul wrote his epistles to the Philippians and Colossians while he was a prisoner in Rome. But these letters don’t have the tone you might expect from someone in prison. Paul spoke more about joy, rejoicing, and thanksgiving than he did about afflictions and trials: “Christ is preached,” he said, “and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice” (\nPhilippians 1:18\n). And “though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding … the steadfastness of your faith in Christ” (\nColossians 2:5\n). Certainly, “the peace of God” that Paul experienced in his difficult circumstances “passeth all understanding” (\nPhilippians 4:7\n), but it was nonetheless a reality. In our own trials, we can feel this same peace and “rejoice in the Lord alway” (\nPhilippians 4:4\n). We can, as Paul did, rely completely upon Jesus Christ, “in whom we have redemption” (\nColossians 1:14\n). We can say, as did Paul, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (\nPhilippians 4:13\n; see also\nColossians 1:11\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nPhilippians 2:5–11\n;\nColossians 1:12–23\nMy faith is founded on Jesus Christ.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson said that when he focused his scripture study on verses about Jesus Christ, it had such an impact on him that he felt like “a different man!” (“\nDrawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 39). Consider following his example as you read Philippians and Colossians (see especially\nPhilippians 2:5–11\n;\nColossians 1:12–23\n). What do you learn about the Savior? How can these truths help you become “a different man” or woman?\nPhilippians 2:12–13\nDo we “work out [our] own salvation”?\nSome people use the phrase “work out your own salvation” (\nPhilippians 2:12\n) to support the idea that we are saved only by our own efforts. Others use Paul’s teaching “by grace are ye saved through faith” (\nEphesians 2:8\n) to claim that no works are required for salvation. However, the scriptures, including the writings of Paul, clearly teach the need for both the grace of Jesus Christ and personal effort in order to receive salvation. And even in our best efforts to work out our salvation, “it is God which worketh in you” (\nPhilippians 2:13\n; see also\nPhilippians 1:6\n;\n2 Nephi 25:23\n; Bible Dictionary, “\nGrace\n”).\nPhilippians 3:4–14\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is worth every sacrifice.\nPaul gave up much when he converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ, including the influential place he held in Jewish society as a Pharisee. In\nPhilippians 3:4–14\n, look for what Paul gained because he was willing to make sacrifices for the gospel. How did he feel about his sacrifices?\nThen consider your own discipleship. What have you sacrificed for the gospel of Jesus Christ? What have you received? Are there any additional sacrifices you feel you need to make to become a more dedicated disciple of the Savior?\nSee also\n3 Nephi 9:19–20\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 58:2–5\n; Taylor G.

What does the Spirit prompt you to record as you read\n1\nand\n2 Thessalonians\n?\nRecord Your Impressions\nIn Thessalonica, Paul and Silas were accused of having “turned the world upside down” (\nActs 17:6\n). Their preaching angered certain leaders among the Jews, and these leaders stirred the people into an uproar (see\nActs 17:1–10\n). As a result, Paul and Silas were advised to leave Thessalonica. Paul worried about the new Thessalonian converts and the persecution they were facing, but he was unable to return to visit them. “When I could no longer forbear,” he wrote, “I sent to know your faith.” In response, Paul’s assistant Timothy, who had been serving in Thessalonica, “brought us good tidings of your faith and charity” (\n1 Thessalonians 3:5–6\n). In fact, the Thessalonian Saints were known as examples “to all that believe” (\n1 Thessalonians 1:7\n), and news of their faith spread to cities abroad. Imagine Paul’s joy and relief to hear that his work among them “was not in vain” (\n1 Thessalonians 2:1\n). But Paul knew that faithfulness in the past is not sufficient for spiritual survival in the future, and he was wary of the influence of false teachers among the Saints (see\n2 Thessalonians 2:2–3\n). His message to them, and to us, is to continue to “perfect that which is lacking in [our] faith” and to “increase more and more” in love (see\n1 Thessalonians 3:10\n;\n4:10\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n1 Thessalonians 1–2\nDisciples of Christ serve others with sincerity and love.\nIn\n1 Thessalonians\n, Paul’s words reveal both the concern and the joy of someone who has given himself wholly to serving God’s children.

But he also wanted them to “abound more and more” in that faithfulness (\n1 Thessalonians 4:1\n).

Invite the Spirit to guide you to answers as you study, and record any inspiration you receive.\nRecord Your Impressions\nIn the epistles Paul wrote to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, we get a glimpse into the heart of a servant of the Lord. Unlike Paul’s other epistles to entire congregations, these were written to individuals—Paul’s close friends and associates in God’s work—and reading them is like listening in on a conversation. We see Paul encouraging Timothy and Titus, two leaders of congregations, in their Church service. We see him entreating his friend Philemon to reconcile with a fellow Saint and treat him like a brother in the gospel. Paul’s words were not addressed to us directly, and he may never have expected that so many people would one day read them. Yet we find in these epistles counsel and encouragement for us, whatever our personal ministry in the service of Christ might be.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWho were Timothy and Titus?\nTimothy and Titus had served with Paul on some of his missionary journeys. During their service, they earned Paul’s respect and trust. Timothy was later called as a Church leader in Ephesus, and Titus was called as a leader in Crete. In these epistles, Paul gave Timothy and Titus instruction and encouragement regarding their responsibilities, which included preaching the gospel and calling men to serve as bishops.\nSee also Bible Dictionary, “\nPauline Epistles\n,” “\nTimothy\n,” “\nTitus\n.”\n“Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers” (1 Timothy 4:12).\n1 Timothy 4:10–16\n“Be thou an example of the believers.”\nTimothy was relatively young, but Paul knew that he could be a great Church leader despite his youth. What counsel did Paul give to Timothy in\n1 Timothy 4:10–16\n? How can this counsel help you lead others to the Savior and His gospel?\nSee also\nAlma 17:11\n.\n2 Timothy\n“God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”\n2 Timothy\nis believed to be the last epistle Paul wrote, and it seems that he knew his time on earth was short (see\n2 Timothy 4:6–8\n). How might Timothy have felt, knowing that he might soon be without his trusted mentor and leader? What did Paul say to encourage him? You might also read with your own challenges and fears in mind. What messages of hope and encouragement does the Lord have for you in\n2 Timothy\n?\nSee also Kelly R. Johnson, “\nEnduring Power\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 112–14.\n2 Timothy 3\nLiving the gospel provides safety from the spiritual dangers of the last days.\nWe are living in “the last days” that Paul spoke of, and the “perilous times” have come (\n2 Timothy 3:1\n). As you read\n2 Timothy 3\n, write down the perils of the last days that are mentioned (see also\n1 Timothy 4:1–3\n):\nCan you think of examples of these perils in the world around you—or in your own life? How do these perils, like the people described in\nverse 6\n, “creep into [your house], and lead [you] captive”? What counsel do you find in\n2 Timothy 3\n, and elsewhere in these epistles, that could keep you and your family safe from these spiritual dangers? (see, for example,\n1 Timothy 1:3–11\n;\n2 Timothy 2:15–16\n;\nTitus 2:1–8\n).\nWho was Philemon?\nPhilemon was a Christian who had been converted to the gospel by Paul. Philemon owned a slave named Onesimus, who apparently escaped to Rome. There Onesimus met Paul and converted to the gospel. Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon with a letter encouraging Philemon to receive Onesimus “not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved” (\nPhilemon 1:16\n).\nPhilemon\nDisciples of Jesus Christ treat one another like brothers and sisters.\nAs you read Paul’s epistle to Philemon, ponder how you might apply his counsel to your relationships with others. Below are some questions you could consider:\nVerses 1–7\n: What do words like “fellowlabourer” and “fellowsoldier” suggest to you about relationships among Saints? When have you felt “refreshed by” a brother or sister in Christ?\nVerses 8–16\n: What does it mean to “enjoin” and “beseech”? Why did Paul choose to\nbeseech\nPhilemon rather than\nenjoin\nhim? What did Paul hope would be accomplished by sending Onesimus back to Philemon?\nVerse 16\n: What does it mean to be “a brother [or sister] beloved … in the Lord”? Do you know someone who you need to receive in this way?\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\n1 Timothy 2:9–10\n.\nWhat does it mean to “adorn [ourselves] … with good works”? What are some good works our family could do this week? You might sing together a song about doing good, such as “\nHave I Done Any Good?\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 223).\n1 Timothy 4:12\n.\nTo help your family members desire to be “an example of the believers,” consider inviting them to draw pictures of people who have been good examples to them.

Hebrews 1–6: ‘Jesus Christ, “the Author of Eternal Salvation,”’”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: New Testament 2023\n(2022)\n“October 30–November 5. Hebrews 1–6,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nBalm of Gilead\n, by Annie Henrie\nOctober 30–November 5\nHebrews 1–6\nJesus Christ, “the Author of Eternal Salvation”\nRecording spiritual impressions helps you recognize what the Holy Ghost wants to teach you. Acting on your impressions demonstrates your faith that those promptings are real.\nRecord Your Impressions\nEach of us has to give up something in order to accept the gospel of Jesus Christ—bad habits, incorrect beliefs, unwholesome associations, or something else. For Gentiles in the early Christian Church, conversion often meant abandoning false gods. For the Hebrews (or Jews), conversion proved to be, if not more difficult, a little more complicated. After all, their cherished beliefs and traditions were rooted in the worship of the true God and the teachings of His prophets, extending back thousands of years. Yet the Apostles taught that the law of Moses had been fulfilled in Jesus Christ and that a higher law was now the standard for believers. Would accepting Christianity mean that the Hebrews must give up their earlier beliefs and history? The Epistle to the Hebrews sought to help settle such questions by teaching that the law of Moses, the prophets, and the ordinances are all important, but Jesus Christ is greater (see\nHebrews 1:1–4\n;\n3:1–6\n;\n7:23–28\n). In fact, all these things point to and testify of Christ as the Son of God and the promised Messiah the Jews had been waiting for.\nConversion, in those early days and today, means making Jesus Christ the center of our worship and our lives. It means holding fast to truth and letting go of that which distracts us from Him, for He is the “author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him” (\nHebrews 5:9\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWho wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews?\nSome scholars have questioned whether Paul wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews. The literary style of Hebrews is somewhat different from Paul’s other letters, and the earliest versions of the text did not name an author. However, because the ideas expressed in Hebrews are consistent with Paul’s other teachings, Latter-day Saints, in keeping with Christian tradition, have generally accepted that Paul was at least involved in writing this epistle.\nSee also Bible Dictionary, “\nPauline Epistles\n.”\nHebrews 1–5\nJesus Christ is “the express image” of Heavenly Father.\nMany Jews found it difficult to accept Jesus Christ as the Son of God. Notice how the Epistle to the Hebrews testifies of Him. For example, as you read the first five chapters, you might make a list of Jesus Christ’s titles, roles, attributes, and works that you find mentioned. What do these things teach you about the Savior? What do they teach you about Heavenly Father?\nWhat does the following statement from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland add to your understanding of the teachings in these chapters? “Jesus … came to improve man’s view of God and to plead with them to love their Heavenly Father as He has always and will always love them. … So feeding the hungry, healing the sick, rebuking hypocrisy, pleading for faith—this was Christ showing us the way of the Father” (“\nThe Grandeur of God\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2003, 72).\nHebrews 2:9–18\n;\n4:12–16\n;\n5:7–8\nJesus Christ suffered all things so that He can understand and help me when I suffer.\nDo you feel that you can “come boldly unto the throne of grace” and seek mercy? (\nHebrews 4:16\n). One message of the Epistle to the Hebrews is that despite our sins and weaknesses, God is approachable and His grace is attainable. What do you find in\nHebrews 2:9–18\n;\n4:12–16\n;\n5:7–8\nthat strengthens your confidence that Jesus Christ will help you with your mortal challenges? Consider recording in a journal your thoughts and feelings about what the Savior has done for you.\nSee also\nMosiah 3:7–11\n;\nAlma 7:11–13\n;\n34\n; Matthew S. Holland, “\nThe Exquisite Gift of the Son\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 45–47.\nHebrews 3:7–19\n;\n4:1–11\nGod’s blessings are available to those who “harden not [their] hearts.”\nBy retelling the story of the ancient Israelites, Paul hoped to persuade the Jews to avoid the mistake their ancestors made—rejecting God’s blessings because of unbelief. (You can read the story Paul alluded to in\nNumbers 14:1–12, 26–35\n.)\nConsider how\nHebrews 3:7–19\n;\n4:1–11\nmight apply to you. To do this, you might ponder questions like these:\nHow did the Israelites provoke the Lord? (see\nHebrews 3:8–11\n). What are the consequences of having a hard heart?\nWhen have I allowed my heart to become hardened? Are there any blessings God wants to give me that I am not receiving because of a lack of faith?\nWhat can I do to develop a soft and contrite heart?

      "plain_text": "“November 6–12. Hebrews 7–13: ‘An High Priest of Good Things to Come,’”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: New Testament 2023\n(2022)\n“November 6–12. Hebrews 7–13,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nMelchizedek Blesses Abram\n, by Walter Rane. Gift of the artist\nNovember 6–12\nHebrews 7–13\n“An High Priest of Good Things to Come”\nAs you read\nHebrews 7–13\n, you may receive impressions through the Holy Ghost. Consider ways you can record them; for example, you could record them in this outline, in the margins of your scriptures, or in a notebook or journal.\nRecord Your Impressions\nEven faithful Saints at times suffer “reproaches and afflictions” that can shake their confidence (see\nHebrews 10:32–38\n). Paul knew that Jewish converts to Christianity were experiencing severe persecution because of their new faith. To encourage them to stay true to their testimonies, he reminded them of the long tradition of faithful believers from their own history: Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sara, Joseph, Moses—“a cloud of witnesses” that God’s promises are real and worth waiting for (see\nHebrews 11\n;\n12:1\n). This tradition is yours too. It’s a heritage of faith shared by all those who look “unto Jesus [as] the author and finisher of our faith” (\nHebrews 12:2\n). Because of Him, whenever adversity makes us want to “draw back,” we can instead “draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith” (\nHebrews 10:22, 38\n). For us, as for the ancient Saints, Jesus Christ is our “high priest of good things to come” (\nHebrews 9:11\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nHebrews 7\nThe Melchizedek Priesthood points me to Jesus Christ.\nFor centuries, the Jews had exercised the Levitical Priesthood, also known as the Aaronic Priesthood. But with the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ came the restoration of the greater Melchizedek Priesthood, which offered even greater blessings. What do you learn about the Melchizedek Priesthood from\nHebrews 7\n? Keeping in mind that the purpose of this epistle—like all scripture—is to build faith in Jesus Christ, you might note passages that testify of Him.\nHere are some examples of other truths you might find:\nJoseph Smith Translation, Hebrews 7:3, 21\n:\nThose who are ordained to the Melchizedek Priesthood “are made like unto the Son of God” and are “[priests] forever.”\nHebrews 7:11\n:\nThe Levitical Priesthood does not offer “perfection” and was therefore superseded by the Melchizedek (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:18–22\n).\nHebrews 7:20–21\n:\nThe Melchizedek Priesthood is received through an “oath and covenant” (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:33–44\n).\nWhat blessings have you received from the Melchizedek Priesthood and “the ordinances thereof”? (\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:20\n). How has the Melchizedek Priesthood helped you come unto Christ?\nSee also\nAlma 13:1–13\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:36–46\n; Gospel Topics, “\nMelchizedek Priesthood\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; Guide to the Scriptures, “\nMelchizedek\n,”\nscriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nThe Melchizedek Priesthood and the Keys\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 69–72.\nHebrews 9\n;\n10:1–22\nAncient and modern ordinances point to Jesus Christ.\nThe original Hebrew readers of this epistle would have been very familiar with the ancient tabernacle and the ordinances Paul described. But some did not fully recognize that the purpose of these ordinances was to point to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.\nIn biblical times, on a yearly holiday called the Day of Atonement, a high priest entered the holiest place (or Holy of Holies) in the Jerusalem temple and sacrificed a goat or lamb to atone for the sins of Israel.\nAs you read Paul’s description of these ordinances, look for symbols and teachings that help you better understand the Savior’s atoning mission.\nThe ordinances we participate in today are different from those in Paul’s time, but their purpose is the same. How do today’s ordinances testify to you of Jesus Christ?\nTo learn more about ancient Jewish ceremonies and their symbolism, see the videos “The Tabernacle” and “Sacrifice and Sacrament” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\nThe Tabernacle\nSacrifice and Sacrament\nHebrews 11\nFaith requires trusting in God’s promises.\nIf someone asked you to define faith, what would you say? Sister Anne C. Pingree drew on language from\nHebrews 11\nto give this definition of faith: “The spiritual ability to be persuaded of promises that are seen ‘afar off’ but that may not be attained in this life” (“\nSeeing the Promises Afar Off\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2003, 14).\nConsider developing your own definition of faith as you ponder the ideas in\nHebrews 11\n. What do the examples of the people mentioned in this chapter teach you about faith? (See also\nEther 12:6–22\n.)\nWhat promises do you see “afar off”? How can you show the Lord that you are “persuaded of them, and [have] embraced them”? (\nHebrews 11:13\n).\nSee also\nAlma 32:21, 26–43\n; Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nAn High Priest of Good Things to Come\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1999, 36–38; Gospel Topics, “\nFaith in Jesus Christ\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nHebrews 10:32–36\n.\nYou might invite family members to share spiritual experiences when they felt “illuminated” with truth. How can these experiences help us “cast not away therefore [our] confidence” in times of trial or doubt?\nHebrews 11\n.\nHow can you help your family members learn from the faithful examples mentioned in\nHebrews 11\n? It might be fun to act out the stories of some of these examples. You can review some of these stories in\nOld Testament Stories\n. Or perhaps your family could discuss the examples of other faithful people you know—including ancestors, Church leaders, and members of your community. You could also sing a song about faith, such as “\nFaith\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 96–97).\nHebrews 12:2\n.\nAccording to this verse, why was Jesus willing to endure the pain and suffering of the cross? What does this teach us about how we can endure our trials? President Russell M. Nelson gave some helpful insights on this verse in his message “\nJoy and Spiritual Survival\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 81–84).\nHebrews 12:5–11\n.\nWhy does the Lord chasten and correct us? What do we notice in these verses about the way the Lord sees chastisement? How do these verses affect the way we give or receive chastisement?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested song: “\nFaith\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 96–97.\nImproving Our Teaching\nUse music to invite the Spirit and learn doctrine.\nThe First Presidency said, “Music has boundless powers for moving [us] toward greater spirituality” (“\nFirst Presidency Preface\n,”\nHymns\n, x). Perhaps a song about faith, such as “\nTrue to the Faith\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 254), would supplement a family discussion from\nHebrews 11\n.\nThe symbols and ordinances of the ancient temple taught about the role of Jesus Christ."

(\nJames 1:22\n).\nRecord Your Impressions\nSometimes just one verse of scripture can change the world.\nJames 1:5\nseems like a simple bit of counsel—if you need wisdom, ask God. But when 14-year-old Joseph Smith read that verse, “it seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of [his] heart” (\nJoseph Smith—History 1:12\n). Thus inspired, Joseph acted on James’s admonition and sought wisdom from God through prayer. And God did indeed give liberally, giving Joseph one of the most remarkable heavenly visitations in human history—the First Vision. This vision changed the course of Joseph’s life and led to the Restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ on the earth. All of us are blessed today because Joseph Smith read and acted on\nJames 1:5\n.\nWhat will you find as you study the\nEpistle of James\n? Perhaps a verse or two will change you or someone you love.

You may feel prompted to make your actions align better with your faith. Whatever inspires you, let these words “enter … into every feeling of [your] heart.” And then, when you “receive with meekness the … word,” as James wrote, be a doer of the word, not a hearer only (see\nJames 1:21–22\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nWho was James?\nIt is generally believed that the author of the\nEpistle of James\nwas a son of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, and therefore the half brother of the Savior.

Do you sense any changes you need to make in the way you treat or think of others?\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nJames 1:5\n.\nAfter reading\nJames 1:5\n, your family could summarize the account of the First Vision (see\nJoseph Smith—History 1:8–20\n) or watch the video “Ask of God: Joseph Smith’s First Vision” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Invite family members to share their testimonies of the Prophet Joseph Smith and experiences when Heavenly Father answered their prayers.\nAsk of God: Joseph Smith's First Vision\nJames 1:26–27\n.\nConsider watching the video “True Christianity” (\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Then read James’s definition of “pure religion” in\nJames 1:26–27\n, and discuss ways your family can make your practice of religion more pure.\nTrue Christianity\nJames 3\n.\nJames 3\nincludes many images that could inspire memorable object lessons to help your family remember to speak kindly. For example, you could build a fire together and talk about how a small, unkind word can cause a big problem (see\nverses 5–6\n). Or you could serve something sour in something that is usually used for sweet food—such as lemon juice in a honey jar. This could lead to a discussion about using sweet and uplifting words (see\nverses 9–14\n).\nJames 4:5–8\n.\nWhy should we “draw nigh to God” (\nJames 4:8\n) when we face temptation?\nJames 5:14–16\n.\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks taught that “parents should encourage more priesthood blessings in the family” (“\nThe Powers of the Priesthood\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 67). Perhaps reading\nJames 5:14–16\nand sharing experiences about receiving a priesthood blessing could encourage family members to ask for a blessing when they are sick or need spiritual strength.\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested hymn: “\nHave I Done Any Good?\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 223.\nImproving Personal Study\nAct on what you learn.\nAs you study, listen to promptings from the Spirit about how you can apply what you are learning to your life. Commit to follow these promptings and live the gospel more fully. (See\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n,\n35\n.)\nJames’s admonition to “ask of God” (\nJames 1:5\n) inspired Joseph Smith to seek wisdom from God. Photograph by Christina Smith."

Promptly record them while you are “yet in the Spirit” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 76:80\n) so you can accurately capture what God teaches you.\nRecord Your Impressions\nShortly after His Resurrection, the Savior made a prophecy that must have been troubling to Peter. He foretold that Peter would be martyred for his faith, being carried “whither [he] wouldest not … , signifying by what death he should glorify God” (\nJohn 21:18–19\n). Years later, when Peter wrote his epistles, he knew that his prophesied martyrdom was near: “Shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me” (\n2 Peter 1:14\n). And yet Peter’s words were not filled with fear or pessimism. Instead, he taught the Saints to “greatly rejoice,” even though they were “in heaviness through manifold temptations.” He counseled them to remember that “the trial of [their] faith” would lead to “praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ” and to “the salvation of [their] souls” (\n1 Peter 1:6–7, 9\n). Peter’s faith must have been comforting to those early Saints, as it is encouraging to Saints today, who are also “partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, [we] may be glad also with exceeding joy” (\n1 Peter 4:13\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n1 Peter 1:3–9\n;\n2:19–24\n;\n3:14–17\n;\n4:12–19\nI can find joy during times of trial and suffering.\nThe period after Christ’s Crucifixion wasn’t an easy time to be a Christian, and Peter’s first epistle acknowledges that.

        "If you were to choose one or two words to describe God, what would they be?

What do you find in 1 John 2:24–29 ; 3:1–3 that gives you confidence and comfort as a disciple of Jesus Christ?

Record these impressions and act on them.\nRecord Your Impressions\nWhen John and Jude wrote their epistles, corrupt doctrine had already started leading many Saints into apostasy. Some false teachers were even questioning whether Jesus Christ had actually appeared “in the flesh” (see, for example,\n1 John 4:1–3\n;\n2 John 1:7\n). What could a Church leader do in such a situation? The Apostle John responded by sharing his personal witness of the Savior: “This is the testimony which we give of that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life” (Joseph Smith Translation,\n1 John 1:1\n[in 1 John 1:1, footnote\na\n]). And then John taught about love: God’s love for us and the love we should have for Him and all His children. After all, John was a witness of that, too. He had personally experienced the Savior’s love (see\nJohn 13:23\n;\n20:2\n), and he wanted the Saints to feel that same love. John’s testimony and teachings on love are just as needed today, when faith in Jesus Christ is questioned and false teachings abound. Reading John’s epistles can help us face today’s adversities with courage, for “there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear” (\n1 John 4:18\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\n1 John\n;\n2 John\nGod is light, and God is love.\nIf you were to choose one or two words to describe God, what would they be? In his epistles, John often used the words “light” and “love” (see, for example,\n1 John 1:5\n;\n2:8–11\n;\n3:16, 23–24\n;\n4:7–21\n). As you read the first two epistles of John, ponder the experiences John had with the Savior’s light and love. For example, consider what John learned from Jesus’s teachings in\nJohn 3:16–17\n;\n12:35–36, 46\n;\n15:9–14\n;\n19:25–27\n. Do you see any similarities between these teachings and what\n1 John\nteaches about the light and love of God? What experiences have taught you that God is light and love?\n1 John 2–4\n;\n2 John\n“If we love one another, God dwelleth in us.”\nYou will also find words like “abide” and “dwell” repeated throughout John’s epistles. Look for these words, especially as you read\n1 John 2–4\nand\n2 John\n. What do you think it means to “abide” or “dwell” in God and His doctrine? (see\n2 John 1:9\n). What does it mean to you to have God “abide” or “dwell” in you?\n1 John 2:24–29\n;\n3:1–3\nI can become like Jesus Christ.\nDoes the goal of becoming Christlike ever seem too lofty to you? Consider John’s encouraging counsel: “Little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence … [and] we shall be like him” (\n1 John 2:28\n;\n3:2\n). What do you find in\n1 John 2:24–29\n;\n3:1–3\nthat gives you confidence and comfort as a disciple of Jesus Christ?

Revelation 1–5,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nDecember 4–10\nRevelation 1–5\n“Glory, and Power, Be unto … the Lamb for Ever”\nConsider writing down questions you have about what you read in\nRevelation\n. You can then search for answers to your questions or discuss them with a family member or in Church classes.\nRecord Your Impressions\nHave you ever struggled to express to others what you felt during a powerful spiritual experience? Everyday language can feel inadequate to describe spiritual feelings and impressions. Perhaps this is why John used such rich symbolism and imagery to describe his majestic revelation. He could have simply stated that he saw Jesus Christ, but to help us understand his experience, he described the Savior using words like these: “His eyes were as a flame of fire,” “out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword,” and “his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength” (\nRevelation 1:14–16\n). As you read the book of\nRevelation\n, try to discover the messages John wanted you to learn and feel, even if you don’t understand the meaning behind every symbol. Why might he have compared Church congregations to candlesticks, Satan to a dragon, and Jesus Christ to a lamb? Ultimately, you don’t have to understand every symbol in\nRevelation\nto understand its important themes, including its most prominent theme: Jesus Christ and His followers will triumph over the kingdoms of men and of Satan.\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nJohn’s vision teaches about Heavenly Father’s plan to save His children.\nThe book of\nRevelation\ncan be hard to understand, but don’t get discouraged. John’s promise may inspire you to keep trying: “Blessed are they who\nread\n, and they who\nhear and understand\nthe words of this prophecy, and\nkeep\nthose things which are written therein, for the time of the coming of the Lord draweth nigh” (\nJoseph Smith Translation, Revelation 1:3\n[in the Bible appendix], emphasis added).\nOne way to study\nRevelation\nis to look for connections to the plan of salvation. This general overview may help you:\nChapters 5\nand\n12\ndescribe events in the premortal life.\nChapters 6–11\n,\n13–14\n,\n16–19\ndescribe mortal life and events in the history of the earth.\nChapters 2–3\n,\n15\n,\n20–22\ndescribe the Final Judgment and the glory that awaits the faithful.\nAs you read, ask yourself, “What does this teach me about God’s plan? What has God done to help me overcome evil and return to Him? What are His promises to the faithful?”\nIt might also be helpful to know that\nDoctrine and Covenants 77\nexplains some of the symbols used in\nRevelation\n. In addition, the Joseph Smith Translation clarifies several passages in\nRevelation\n, so check the footnotes and the Bible appendix regularly.\nSee also Bible Dictionary, “\nJohn\n,” “\nRevelation of John\n.”\nRevelation 1\nJesus Christ is the Living Son of the Living God.\nThe first chapter of\nRevelation\ndescribes Jesus Christ’s appearance to John in a vision. Perhaps you could make a list of everything this chapter says about Jesus Christ, including who He is, what He does for us, and what He is like.\nSome things you learn will come from symbols. Ponder what the Lord might be trying to teach you about Himself through these symbols. For example, notice that the Savior calls Himself “the beginning and the ending” and “the first and the last.” Why do you think these titles are significant? What do these titles teach you about the Savior?\nRevelation 2–3\nJesus Christ knows me personally and will help me overcome my challenges.\nThe Savior’s words in\nRevelation 2–3\nreveal that He understood the successes and struggles unique to each branch of the Church in John’s day.

Soon you will come to recognize the beauty and power found on those pages” (“\nThe Key to Spiritual Protection\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2013, 27).\nRecord Your Impressions\nImagine a woman “travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.” Now imagine “a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns” hovering over the woman, poised to “devour her child as soon as it was born” (\nRevelation 12:2–4\n). To understand these verses of John’s revelation, remember that these images represent the Church and kingdom of God and the peril they would face. For the Saints who experienced intense persecution in John’s day, victory over evil may not have seemed likely. This victory can also be hard to foresee in a day like ours, when the adversary is at “war with the saints” and has “power … over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations” (\nRevelation 13:7\n). But the end of John’s revelation gloriously shows that good will prevail over evil. Babylon will fall. And the Saints will come “out of great tribulation” with robes of white—not because their robes were never stained but because the Saints will “have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb” (\nRevelation 7:14\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nRevelation 6–11\nJohn saw many events of earth’s history, especially those of the latter days.\nIn these chapters you will read about a book with seven seals. If you wonder what that means, you aren’t alone. The Prophet Joseph Smith did too. The Lord revealed to Joseph that this book and its seals represent the story of the earth’s “temporal existence,” with each seal representing a thousand years (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 77:6–7\n). You might be interested to know that the events of the first four seals are summarized in John’s vision in only eight verses (\nRevelation 6:1–8\n). The next three verses describe the fifth seal (\nverses 9–11\n). The events of the last two seals take up most of the rest of the book of\nRevelation\n. In other words, the main focus of John’s vision is the last days—our days. As you read, ponder why it is valuable to know what John wrote about the latter days.\nAs you read about the events John prophesied of, consider the following suggestions and questions:\nRead\nRevelation 7\nwith the work of gathering Israel in mind. What thoughts do you have about this work? (see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 77:8–11\n). What do you learn from\nverses 13–17\nabout Jesus Christ and those who come to Him?\nWhat do\nchapters 8\n;\n9\n; and\n11\nteach you about the events of the last days? (see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 77:12–13, 15\n). How can we prepare spiritually for these events?\nRevelation 10\ntells of a book that an angel gives to John and commands him to eat. What might this symbolize? (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 77:14\n).\nRevelation 12–13\nThe War in Heaven continues on earth.\nWe don’t know a lot about the War in Heaven, but there is a vivid though brief description of it in\nRevelation 12:7–11\n. As you read these verses, picture yourself as part of that premortal conflict. What do you learn about how Satan is overcome? (see\nverse 11\n).\nThe war that started in heaven continues on earth, as Satan persists to “make war with [those who] have the testimony of Jesus Christ” (\nRevelation 12:17\n). What do you learn from\nRevelation 13\nabout how he is waging that war today? How do “the blood of the Lamb” and “the word of [your] testimony” (\nRevelation 12:11\n) continue to help you in this war?\nSee also\n1 Nephi 14:12–14\n;\nMoroni 7:12–13\n;\nMoses 4:1–4\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:36–37\n; Gospel Topics, “\nWar in Heaven\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nRevelation 14:6–7\n“I saw another angel … having the everlasting gospel.”\nOne fulfillment of the prophecy in these verses occurred when Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith and led him to the records that he translated and published as the Book of Mormon. This book contains the “everlasting gospel” that we are charged with preaching unto “every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people” (\nRevelation 14:6\n).\nTo learn about other angels who have participated in restoring the everlasting gospel, see\nDoctrine and Covenants 13\n;\n27:5–13\n;\n110:11–16\n;\n128:20–21\n.\nSee also “\nThe Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World\n,”\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nIdeas for Family Scripture Study and Home Evening\nRevelation 7:9, 13–15\n.\nWhat can these verses teach us about why we wear white for baptismal and temple ordinances?\nRevelation 7:14–17\n.\nConsider inviting family members to share their feelings about the Lord’s promises in these verses. How can His promises help us when we are in “great tribulation”? (\nverse 14\n).\nRevelation 12:7–11\n;\n14:6\n.\nSome family members might enjoy drawing pictures of the visions described in\nRevelation\n. For example, drawing pictures based on\nRevelation 12\ncould lead to discussions about the War in Heaven (see\nverses 7–11\n). Pictures based on\nRevelation 14:6\ncould lead to discussions about the Restoration of the gospel.\nAfter reading\nRevelation 14:6\ntogether, consider showing pictures of the angel Moroni and of other angels who helped restore the gospel in our day (see the pictures at the end of this outline). Perhaps family members could take turns holding up one of the pictures and sharing reasons they are thankful that angels came “having the everlasting gospel to preach unto [us].”\nRevelation 12:11\n.\nWhat might the phrase “the word of their testimony” mean? How do our testimonies of Jesus Christ help us and others overcome Satan?\nRevelation 13:11–14\n.\nWhat thoughts do your family members have about the deceiving beast? How do we detect and avoid deceptions we see in the world today?\nFor more ideas for teaching children, see\nthis week’s outline\nin\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nSuggested song: “\nI Will Be Valiant\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 162.\nImproving Personal Study\nImmerse yourself in the scriptures.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “Daily immersion in the word of God is crucial for spiritual survival, especially in these days of increasing upheaval” (“\nHear Him\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 89).

Christmas,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nLittle Lamb\n, by Jenedy Paige\nDecember 18–24\nChristmas\n“Good Tidings of Great Joy”\nConsider how pondering the Savior’s birth and mission can help bring a spirit of peace and sacredness to the Christmas season.\nRecord Your Impressions\nWhy does the birth of a baby bring such great joy? Perhaps because a new baby can be a symbol of hope. There’s something about a brand-new life full of possibilities that invites us to ponder what life might hold for that child and what wonderful things he or she will accomplish. Never has this been truer than at the birth of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Never has there been more hope placed in a child, and never has there been one born with so much promise.\nWhen an angel invited shepherds to seek a newborn child in a manger, he also gave them a message about that child. It was a message of hope—that this baby had come to earth to fulfill a sacred mission. The shepherds made their message “known abroad … and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart” (\nLuke 2:17–19\n). Perhaps it would be good to follow Mary’s example this Christmas: to ponder in your heart the things you have learned about the Savior this year. How did He fulfill His mission of redemption in the accounts you have read? And more important, how has His mission changed your life? Then you might feel inspired to follow the example of the shepherds: how will you make it “known abroad” what Jesus Christ has done for you?\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nMatthew 1:18–25\n;\n2:1–12\n;\nLuke 1:26–38\n;\n2:1–20\nJesus Christ condescended to be born among us on earth.\nEven if you have read or heard the story of the birth of Jesus Christ many times before, study it this time with this thought in mind: “Christmas is not only a celebration of\nhow\nJesus came into the world but also of knowing\nwho\nHe is—our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ—and of\nwhy\nHe came” (Craig C.

Revelation 15–22,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families: 2023\nThe City Eternal\n, by Keith Larson\nDecember 25–31\nRevelation 15–22\n“He That Overcometh Shall Inherit All Things”\nSometimes the biggest obstacle to learning is our assumption that we don’t need to learn—that we already know. As you read the scriptures, be open to new insights that the Lord wants to give you.\nRecord Your Impressions\nAs you may recall, the book of\nRevelation\nbegins with the Savior declaring Himself to be “the beginning and the ending” (\nRevelation 1:8\n). Fittingly, it ends with similar words: “I am … the beginning and the end” (\nRevelation 22:13\n). But what does that mean? The beginning and the end of what? The book of\nRevelation\npowerfully testifies that Jesus Christ is the beginning and end of\neverything\n—of the great, sweeping drama of human existence and salvation. He is “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (\nRevelation 13:8\n). And He is the King of kings who brings an end to wickedness, sorrow, and even death itself and ushers in “a new heaven and a new earth” (\nRevelation 21:1\n).\nYet before this new heaven and new earth arrive, there is much for us to overcome: plagues, wars, rampant wickedness—all of which\nRevelation\nvividly describes. But Jesus Christ is with us during this part too. He is the “bright and morning star” that shines in the dark sky as a promise that dawn is coming soon (\nRevelation 22:16\n). And it\nis\ncoming soon.\nHe\nis coming. Even as He invites us, “Come unto me” (\nMatthew 11:28\n), He also comes to us. “I come quickly,” He declares. And with hope and faith that has been purified in the fires of latter-day adversity, we answer, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus” (\nRevelation 22:20\n).\nIdeas for Personal Scripture Study\nRevelation 16–18\n;\n21–22\nThe Lord invites me to flee Babylon and inherit “the holy city.”\nAfter witnessing the destruction and perils of the last days, John saw a future day that can be summed up in the Lord’s declaration “Behold, I make all things new” (\nRevelation 21:5\n). One way to understand what that means is to contrast John’s description of Babylon, the symbol of worldliness and wickedness (see\nRevelation 16–18\n), with his description of the new Jerusalem, symbolic of celestial glory in God’s presence (see\nRevelation 21–22\n).

Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenants by partaking of the sacrament each week.",

        "The priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All Church members who keep their covenants are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families (see General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 3.5 , ChurchofJesusChrist.org ). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see General Handbook , 2.2 ).",
        "We receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. When men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys.

        "Temples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including those who did not receive them in this life.

This includes helping them prepare to make and keep sacred covenants, such as the covenant of baptism and the covenants made in the temple. Through these covenants, your children will bind themselves to the Savior, Jesus Christ.\nThere are many ways to prepare your children for this journey on the covenant path, and Heavenly Father will help you discover the best way to help them. As you seek inspiration, keep in mind that not all learning happens during scheduled lessons. In fact, part of what makes learning at home so powerful is the opportunity to learn by example and through small, simple moments—the kind that occur naturally in the flow of daily living. Just as following the covenant path is a consistent, lifelong process, so is learning about the covenant path. (See “\nHome and Family\n,”\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n[2022], 30–31.)\nThere are many ways to prepare your children for their journey on God’s covenant path.\nBelow are some ideas that may lead to further inspiration. You can find additional ideas for teaching Primary-aged children in “Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path” in\nCome, Follow Me—For Primary\n.\nBaptism and Confirmation\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” (\n2 Nephi 31:17\n). Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenants by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nHere are some resources that can help you:\n2 Nephi 31\n; Gospel Topics, “\nBaptism\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child.

Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like the following: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something he or she promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (see\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n).\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell him or her about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have.

In temples, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including those who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year he or she turns 12, your child is old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors.\nTo learn more about baptisms and confirmations for the dead, see “\nAbout Proxy Baptism and Confirmation\n,”\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nAttend the temple as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the\ntemple recommend questions\ntogether. Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together\nMalachi 4:6\n. Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on\nFamilySearch.org\n. Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “\nTemple\n” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “\nPreparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.)\nReceiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel from Heavenly Father to us and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching him or her the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Gospel Topics, “\nPatriarchal Blessings\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nShare with your child your experience of receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how you use the blessing in your life. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nTake time to review together some of the resources in Gospel Topics, “\nPatriarchal Blessings\n.” To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n18.17\n.\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, click the account icon at the top right corner of the screen, and select “Patriarchal Blessing.”\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and to share them with your child.\nGoing to the Temple—the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8\n). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nTo learn more about the temple endowment, see “\nAbout the Temple Endowment\n,”\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nPrepare for the Blessings of the Temple\n,”\nEnsign\n, Oct. 2010, 41–51.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the temple. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there.\nExplore together\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Read together articles like “\nAbout the Temple Endowment\n” and “\nPrepare for the House of the Lord\n.” Let your child ask any questions he or she has about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nPrepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “\nHome-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation\n”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how he or she is keeping the baptismal covenant described in\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n. Also help your child notice how the Lord is blessing him or her. Build your child’s confidence in his or her ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ. You could use\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n27.2\n, to review the covenants we make in the temple.\nServing a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to\nbecome\na missionary long before you\ngo\non a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“\nBecoming a Missionary\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2005, 45–46). The experiences your child has\nbecoming\na missionary will bless him or her eternally, not just for the period of time he or she may serve as a missionary.\nTo learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nPreaching the Gospel of Peace\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 6–7; M. Russell Ballard, “\nMissionary Service Blessed My Life Forever\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 8–10;\nMissionary Preparation: Adjusting to Missionary Life\n,\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nModel how to share the gospel in natural ways. Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive as a member of His Church. Invite others to join your family in Church- and family-related activities.\nLook for opportunities for your family to interact with missionaries. Invite them to teach your friends, or offer to let them teach people in your home. Ask the missionaries about the experiences they’re having and how missionary service is helping them draw closer to Jesus Christ. Also ask what they did (or wish they had done) to prepare to be missionaries.\nIf you served a mission, talk openly and often about your experiences. Or invite friends or family members who served missions to talk about theirs. You could also talk about ways you’ve shared the gospel with others throughout your life. Help your child think of ways he or she can share the gospel.\nGive your child opportunities to teach your family principles of the gospel. Your child could also practice sharing his or her beliefs with others. For example, you could discuss questions like “How would we introduce the Book of Mormon to someone who has never heard of it?” or “How would we describe the need for the Savior to someone who is not a Christian?”\nHelp your child become comfortable talking to people. What are some good ways to start a conversation? Encourage your child to learn how to listen to what others say, understand what is in their hearts, and share truths of the gospel that could bless their lives.\nLook for opportunities for your child to learn about other cultures and faiths. Help him or her recognize and respect the good and true principles in others’ beliefs.\nGoing to the Temple—Sealing\nIn the temple, a husband and wife can be married for eternity. This occurs in an ordinance called sealing. Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your son or daughter, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help him or her prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nTo learn more, see Gospel Topics, “\nSealing\n,”\ntopics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\nRead together “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. What does this proclamation teach about happiness in family life and about successful marriages? With your child, choose one of the principles listed in the proclamation to study. You could look up scriptures related to that principle in the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n. You could also set goals to apply that principle more fully in your family. As you work on your goals, discuss together the effect that living that principle has on family life.\nWith your child, read President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “\nIn Praise of Those Who Save\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 77–80). When you get to the section titled “\nA Society of Disposables\n,” you might look for things in your home that are disposable and other things that are not. Talk about how you treat things differently when you want them to last a long time. What does this suggest about how we should treat marriage and family relationships? What else do we learn from President Uchtdorf’s message about how the Savior can help us build strong marriages and families?\nIf you are married, be open with your child about the things you feel you’re doing well as a couple, the things you’re learning, and the ways you’re trying to improve. If you and your spouse have been sealed in the temple, show your child by example how you strive to keep your covenants with each other and with the Lord. Tell your child how you strive to make Heavenly Father and the Savior the center of your relationship and how They are helping you.\nWhen family decisions need to be made, hold family councils and discussions. Make sure that all family members’ opinions are heard and valued. Use these discussions as an opportunity to model healthy communication and kindness in family relationships, even when not everyone sees things the same way.\nWhen there is disagreement or conflict in the family, demonstrate patience and compassion. Help your child see how handling conflict in Christlike ways can help him or her prepare for a happy marriage. Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:41–42\n, and talk about how the principles in these verses can be applied to marriage."
