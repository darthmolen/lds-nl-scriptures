For this reason, when we study the gospel, we’re not just looking for new information; we want to become a “new creature” (\n2 Corinthians 5:17\n). This means relying on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to help us change our hearts, our views, our actions, and our very natures.\nBut the kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn’t happen all at once. It extends beyond a classroom into an individual’s heart and home. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel. True conversion requires the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nThe Holy Ghost guides us to the truth and bears witness of that truth (see\nJohn 16:13\n). He enlightens our minds, quickens our understandings, and touches our hearts with revelation from God, the source of all truth. The Holy Ghost purifies our hearts. He inspires in us a desire to live by truth, and He whispers to us ways to do this. Truly, “the Holy Ghost … shall teach [us] all things” (\nJohn 14:26\n).\nFor these reasons, in our efforts to live, learn, and teach the gospel, we should first and foremost seek the companionship of the Spirit. This goal should govern our choices and guide our thoughts and actions. We should seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives that influence away—for we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI."

Its introductory pages describe a backstory unlike any other—including visits from angels, an ancient record buried for centuries in a hillside, and a young man translating the record by the power of God. The Book of Mormon is not just a history of ancient American civilizations. It seeks to convince all “that Jesus is the Christ” (\ntitle page of the Book of Mormon\n), and God Himself directed how it was written, preserved, and made available to us. This year, as you read the Book of Mormon, pray about it, and apply its teachings, you will invite the Savior’s power into your life. And you may feel moved to say, as the Three Witnesses did in their testimony, “It is marvelous in [my] eyes.”\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nTitle page of the Book of Mormon\nStudying the Book of Mormon can strengthen my faith in Jesus Christ.\nThe\ntitle page of the Book of Mormon\nprovides more than just a title.

When you feel like murmuring, it can be helpful to read the words of Nephi and Lehi. How did Nephi and Lehi try to help others build faith in God? (see 1 Nephi 4:1–3 ; 5:1–8 ; see also 1 Nephi 7:6–21 ). What do you learn that can help you when you are tempted to murmur or complain?",

It happened in 600 BC, but there are things about this account that might seem familiar to families today. This family was living in a world of wickedness, but the Lord promised them that if they would follow Him, He would lead them to safety. Along the way they had good moments and bad moments, great blessings and miracles, but they also had arguments and contention. Rarely in scripture is there such a detailed account of a family trying to live the gospel: parents struggling to inspire faith in their family and worrying about their safety, children deciding if they will believe their parents, and brothers dealing with jealousy and contention—and sometimes forgiving each other. Overall, there is power in this imperfect family’s examples of faith.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Nephi 1–5\nThe word of God is “of great worth” to me.\nOne prominent message in the Book of Mormon is the “great worth” of the word of God (\n1 Nephi 5:21\n).

For Lehi, however, this vision was also about his family: “Because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam. … But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of you” (\n1 Nephi 8:3–4\n). When Lehi finished describing his vision, he pleaded with Laman and Lemuel to “hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them” (\n1 Nephi 8:37\n). Even if you have studied Lehi’s vision many times, this time think about it the way Lehi did—think of someone you love. As you do, the security of the iron rod, the dangers of the spacious building, and the sweetness of the fruit will take on new meaning. And you will understand more deeply “all the feeling of [the] tender parent” who received this remarkable vision.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Nephi 7:6–21\nI can forgive others.\nWhat impresses you about Nephi’s example in\n1 Nephi 7:6–21\n?

Moses, John, Lehi, and Joseph Smith all had visions like that—visions that expanded their minds and helped them see just how grand and awe-inspiring God’s work really is.\nNephi also had one of these life-changing visions. He saw the ministry of the Savior, the future of Lehi’s posterity in the promised land, and the latter-day destiny of God’s work. After this vision, Nephi was better prepared for the work that lay ahead. And reading about this vision can help prepare you too—for God also has work for you to do in His kingdom. You are among “the saints of the church of the Lamb” seen by Nephi, “who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory” (\n1 Nephi 14:14\n).\nSee also “Nephi Sees a Vision of Future Events” (video), Gospel Library.\nNephi Sees a Vision of Future Events | 1 Nephi 10–15\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Nephi 11\nGod sent Jesus Christ as an expression of His love.\nWhen Nephi asked the angel about the meaning of the tree in Lehi’s vision, the angel could have simply said, “It represents the love of God.” Instead, he showed Nephi a series of symbols and events from the Savior’s life. Look for these symbols and events as you read and ponder\n1 Nephi 11\n. What do you find that helps you understand why Jesus Christ is the ultimate expression of God’s love?\nYou might also consider watching\nBible Videos\nin the Gospel Library that correspond with the events Nephi saw. How has the Savior helped you feel your Heavenly Father’s love?\nSee also Susan H. Porter, “\nGod’s Love: The Most Joyous to the Soul\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 33–35.\n1 Nephi 12–14\nI can be “armed with righteousness” and power.\nNephi would not live to witness much of what he saw in his vision. Why do you think it was valuable for Nephi to know these things? Why is it valuable for you to know them? Ask these questions each time you read about something that Nephi saw in his vision (see\n1 Nephi 12–14\n). What impressions do you receive about your role in the Lord’s “great and … marvelous work”? (\n1 Nephi 14:7\n). What are some of the great and marvelous things He has done for you?\nConsider especially the promise in\n1 Nephi 14:14\n. How has the Savior fulfilled this promise in your life?

But he seemed especially passionate about what he told them in\n1 Nephi 15:23–25\n. What was Nephi’s message, and why do you think he felt so strongly about it?\nElder David A.

You could do the same for your children—give them pictures of the events Nephi saw in\n1 Nephi 11:20, 24, 27, 31, and 33\n(see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n30\n,\n35\n,\n39\n,\n42\n,\n57\n). As you read these verses, help your children find the picture that matches it. What do we learn about Jesus Christ from these verses and pictures?\nSinging a song like “\nHe Sent His Son\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 34–35) could help your children feel God’s love. After you sing, ask your children what they learn from the song. What else do we learn about God’s love from\n1 Nephi 11:22–23\n?\nUse art to help children learn.\nWhen you teach your children a scripture story, help them visualize it. You could use pictures, videos, puppets, costumes, and so on.\n1 Nephi 13:26–29, 35–36, 40\nThe Book of Mormon teaches precious truths.\nTo help your children value the “plain and precious” truths in the Book of Mormon, you could draw a picture and invite your children to change or remove parts of the picture to make it look different. You could use this to teach that things in the Bible were changed and taken out over time. Read together\n1 Nephi 13:40\nand talk about how the Book of Mormon (“these last records”) helps us understand the “plain and precious things” that were lost from the Bible (the “first” records). What “plain and precious” truths have you learned from the Book of Mormon?\nThe video “The Book of Mormon—a Book from God” (Gospel Library) could help your children see why it’s important to have both the Bible and the Book of Mormon. Children might enjoy re-creating the illustration from the video.\nThe Book of Mormon—a Book from God\nThe Book of Mormon restores gospel truths lost during the Apostasy.\n1 Nephi 15:23–24\nHolding fast to the word of God helps me resist temptation.\nGive your children a chance to share what they remember about Lehi’s vision. It might help to use a picture, like the one in last week’s outline. What kept people from reaching the tree? What helped them reach it? You might ask them to find the iron rod in the picture. Read together\n1 Nephi 15:23–24\nto find out what the iron rod represents and how it can help us.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nNephi’s Vision of Mary\n, by James Johnson\nOpen PDF\nNotes\nThe Love of God\n. Artist Sabrina Squires describes the inspiration behind her painting\nThe Love of God\n: “‘All are alike unto God’—I chose to address this concept on a cultural level, attempting to address the pain that racism causes many individuals. The tree and its fruit represent the love of God, and people from different races collect the glowing orbs. The snowy branches of the tree provide a framework for a myriad of colors. To me, these rainbow shards represent God’s excitement and awareness in creating diversity, and that all the colors must work together for optimal beauty. Only when all of the colors of the rainbow are combined does white appear—the hue representing purity and peace. The tree is large and all-encompassing, providing and making room for any who desire to approach and gather. God’s love extends to all of His children, and He gives us the opportunity not only to partake of His love, but to share its abundance.”"

      "plain_text": "“January 29–February 4: ‘I Will Prepare the Way before You.’ 1 Nephi 16–22,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Book of Mormon 2024\n(2023)\n“January 29–February 4. 1 Nephi 16–22,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nJanuary 29–February 4: “I Will Prepare the Way before You”\n1 Nephi 16–22\nAs Lehi’s family journeyed toward the promised land, the Lord made them this promise: “I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments” (\n1 Nephi 17:13\n). Clearly, that promise did not mean that the journey would be easy—family members still disagreed, bows broke, people struggled and died, and they still had to build a ship from raw materials. However, when the family faced adversity or tasks that seemed impossible, Nephi recognized that the Lord was never far away. He knew that God “doth nourish [the faithful], and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them” (\n1 Nephi 17:3\n). If you ever wonder why bad things happen to good people like Nephi and his family, you may find insights in these chapters. But perhaps more important, you will see what good people do when bad things happen.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n1 Nephi 16–18\nThe Savior will help me face life’s challenges.\nNephi’s family faced some tough challenges—like all of us do. What can you learn from Nephi about facing adversity with faith in Jesus Christ? Read about his experiences in\n1 Nephi 16:17–32\n;\n16:34–39\n;\n17:7–16\n;\n18:1–4\n; and\n18:9–22.\nConsider recording what you find under headings like these: “Challenge,” “How Nephi Responded,” and “How the Lord Helped.” What do you learn that you could apply to the challenges you face?\nAfter learning from Nephi and his family, you might record additional thoughts under these headings: “My Challenges,” “How I Will Respond,” and “How the Lord Can Help Me.” As you do, you could refer to scriptures like these:\nMatthew 11:28–30\n;\nJohn 14:26–27\n;\nMosiah 24:13–15\n. A hymn like “\nWhere Can I Turn for Peace?\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 129) could strengthen your faith in the Savior and the help He offers during times of trial.\nSee also Anthony D. Perkins, “\nRemember Thy Suffering Saints, O Our God\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 103–5; “He Will Give You Help,” “The Lord Guides Lehi’s Journey,” “The Lord Commands Nephi to Build a Ship,” and “Lehi’s Family Sails to the Promised Land” (videos), Gospel Library; “\nLife Help\n,” Gospel Library.\nHe Will Give You Help\nThe Lord Guides Lehi's Journey | 1 Nephi 16\nThe Lord Commands Nephi to Build a Ship | 1 Nephi 17–18\nLehi's Family Sails to the Promised Land | 1 Nephi 18\n1 Nephi 16:10–16, 23–31\n;\n18:11–22\nGod guides me through small and simple means.\nWhen God led Lehi’s family into the wilderness, He didn’t give them a map showing every detail of the journey. Instead, He gave them the Liahona to guide them daily. As you read\n1 Nephi 16:10–16, 23–31\n, and\n18:10–22\n, consider making a list of truths that illustrate how God guides His children (for example,\n1 Nephi 16:10\ncan teach that God sometimes guides us in unexpected ways). What similarities do you see between the Liahona and the Holy Ghost? What are the “small means” by which He has brought about “great things” in your life?\nSee also\nAlma 37:7, 38–47\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 64:33–34\n.\n1 Nephi 17:1–6, 17–22\nMy trials can be a blessing.\nAlthough Nephi and his brothers had the same challenges in the wilderness, their experiences were very different. You could contrast Nephi’s account of traveling in the wilderness (see\n1 Nephi 17:1–6\n) with his brothers’ account (see\n1 Nephi 17:17–22\n). What did Nephi know or do that helped him have a faithful perspective? Consider writing about a recent or current trial from the perspective of faith and gratitude. What do you feel or learn from this?\nSee also Amy A. Wright, “\nChrist Heals That Which Is Broken\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 81–84; “No Strength without Struggle” (video), Gospel Library.\nNo Strength without Struggle\nQuiet reflection time.\nTaking time to think, ponder, reflect, or write can lead to inspiration. It can help us see how the doctrine or principles of the gospel relate to our lives. When you teach others, give them time to reflect and write their impressions. This can also increase their willingness to share their thoughts and feelings with others.\n1 Nephi 19:22–24\n;\n20–22\nI can “liken all scriptures” to myself.\nBecause the scriptures were written so long ago, it might seem like they aren’t relevant to us today. But Nephi knew better. “I did liken all scriptures unto us,” he said, “that it might be for our profit and learning” (\n1 Nephi 19:23\n). This is one reason Nephi found so much spiritual power in the scriptures.\nConsider questions like the following as you read\n1 Nephi 20–22\n:\n1 Nephi 20:1–9\n.\nWhat do these verses teach about the people in Isaiah’s time? What do you find that applies to you?\n1 Nephi 20:17–22\n.\nWhat do these verses teach about how Heavenly Father led the people of Isaiah’s time? How does He invite you to follow Him?\nWhat else do you find in\n1 Nephi 20–22\nthat you can “liken” to yourself?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n1 Nephi 16:10, 28–29\n;\n18:8–13, 20–22\nWhen I keep the commandments, the Lord guides me.\nIf you have a compass, a map, or something else that helps us find our way, you could show it to your children. This could be a good way to begin a discussion about the Liahona, which you can read about in\n1 Nephi 16:10, 28–29\n. What are some reasons a compass or map might not work? Why did the Liahona sometimes not work for Lehi’s family? (see\n1 Nephi 18:9–12, 20–22\n). What has Heavenly Father given us today to guide us back to Him?\nTo help your children apply what they learn about the Liahona in\n1 Nephi 16:10, 26–31\n;\n18:8–22\n, you could invite them to think about an important or difficult decision. What has God given us to guide us today that works like the Liahona? (See, for example,\nAlma 37:38–44\n.) Consider sharing a personal experience in which Heavenly Father guided you.\n1 Nephi 16:21–32\nI can be a good example to my family.\nAs you read\n1 Nephi 16:21–32\ntogether, help your children discover how Nephi’s example blessed his family (see also the video “The Lord Guides Lehi’s Journey” [Gospel Library]). This could lead to a discussion about how we could be like Nephi. Invite your children to plan one thing they can do to be a good influence on other family members.\nThe Lord Guides Lehi's Journey | 1 Nephi 16\nThe Liahona and the Broken Bow\n1 Nephi 17:7–19\n;\n18:1–4\nHeavenly Father can help me do difficult things.\nChildren love telling stories. You could invite them to help you tell the story of Nephi being commanded to build a boat (see\n1 Nephi 17:7–19\n;\n18:1–4\n; see also “\nChapter 7: Building the Ship\n,” in\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 21–22; or the video “The Lord Instructs Nephi to Build a Ship” [Gospel Library]). They could also sing together the second verse of “\nNephi’s Courage\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 120–21). What helped Nephi have courage when his brothers mocked him for trying to build the boat?\nA Ship to Cross the Sea\nThe Lord Instructs Nephi to Build a Ship | 1 Nephi 17:7–10\nA Storm on the Sea\nNephi did not know how to build a boat, so he relied on instruction from the Lord. After reading\n1 Nephi 18:1\nwith you, your children could complete\nthis week’s activity page\n. As they do, talk with them about how Heavenly Father can help us do hard things, just as He helped Nephi.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nOpen PDF"

      "plain_text": "“February 5–11: ‘Free to Choose Liberty and Eternal Life, through the Great Mediator.’ 2 Nephi 1–2,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Book of Mormon 2024\n(2023)\n“February 5–11. 2 Nephi 1–2,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nAdam and Eve\n, by Douglas Fryer\nFebruary 5–11: “Free to Choose Liberty and Eternal Life, through the Great Mediator”\n2 Nephi 1–2\nIf you knew that your life was coming to an end, what final messages would you want to share with the people you love most? When the prophet Lehi felt he was nearing the end of his life, he gathered his family together one last time. He shared with them what Heavenly Father had revealed to him. He bore his testimony of the Messiah. He taught gospel truths he cherished to the people he cherished. He talked about liberty, obedience, the Fall of Adam and Eve, redemption through Jesus Christ, and joy. Not all of his children chose to live by what he taught—none of us can make these choices for our loved ones. But we can teach and testify of the Redeemer, who makes us “free to choose liberty and eternal life” (see\n2 Nephi 2:26–27\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Nephi 1:13–29\nI can “awake! and arise from the dust.”\nIn\n2 Nephi 1:13–29\n, notice the words Lehi used to describe the spiritual condition of Laman and Lemuel. What helps you awaken from a spiritual “deep sleep”? What helps you shake off the spiritual “chains” in your life? Think about Lehi’s testimony in\nverse 15\nand his invitation in\nverse 23\n. What message does Heavenly Father have for you in these verses?\nUse visuals.\nUsing visuals will help learners understand gospel truths and remember them longer. As you prepare to teach from this outline, consider what visuals you could use. For example, maybe a paper chain could help learners understand Lehi’s words in\n2 Nephi 1:13\nor\n2 Nephi 2:27\n.\n2 Nephi 2\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I am “free to choose liberty and eternal life.”\nLehi’s family was now in a new land, full of new possibilities. The choices they made in this new place would be important for their success and happiness. Perhaps this is why Lehi taught his son Jacob about agency, or the ability to make choices, in\n2 Nephi 2\n. As you study\nverses 11–30\n, write down possible answers to these questions:\nWhy is agency so important to Heavenly Father, even though some people use it in hurtful ways?\nHow does the adversary try to weaken or destroy your agency?\nHow does the Savior help you “choose liberty and eternal life” (\nverse 27\n)?\nHere’s another way to learn about agency in\n2 Nephi 2\n: Look for things that are essential for us to have agency and to reach our divine potential. For example:\n2 Nephi 2:5\n: A knowledge of good and evil; a law\n2 Nephi 2:11, 16\n:\n2 Nephi 2:16\n:\n2 Nephi 2:21\n:\n2 Nephi 2:6–9, 26–28\n:\nWhat would happen to our agency if one or more of these things were missing?\nEach of the six sections of\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\ncontains “Invitations” and “Promised Blessings.” Look at one or more of these sections, and choose a promised blessing you hope for in your life. What invitation do you need to act on to receive this blessing? Consider sharing with someone the blessings you have received from following these invitations.\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nAgency and Accountability\n,” Gospel Library; “\nKnow This, That Every Soul Is Free\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 240.\n2 Nephi 2:1–4, 6–25\nGod can turn my trials into blessings.\nLehi knew that his young son Jacob had suffered “afflictions” and “much sorrow” during his childhood (\n2 Nephi 2:1\n). Why do you think Lehi’s testimony in\n2 Nephi 2:1–3, 6–25\nwould have been valuable to Jacob? Why is it valuable to you? Look for words and phrases that you find especially powerful. How has God consecrated your afflictions for your gain? (See\n2 Nephi 2:2\n.)\nSee also\nRomans 8:28\n; Dale G. Renlund, “\nInfuriating Unfairness\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 41–45.\n2 Nephi 2:15–29\nThe Fall and the Atonement of Jesus Christ are essential parts of Heavenly Father’s plan.\nMany people believe that the Fall was only a tragedy and that Eve and Adam made a permanent mistake when they chose to eat the fruit. In\n2 Nephi 2:15–28\n, Lehi teaches additional truth about the Fall—and about redemption through Christ. As you search these verses, make a list of truths about what happened in the Garden of Eden. Questions like these could help:\nWhy was the Fall necessary?\nWhat role did Jesus Christ play in overcoming the effects of the Fall?\nHow does correctly understanding the Fall help us better understand our need for Jesus Christ?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nThe Great Plan of Happiness\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 1993, 72–75.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nLet Not Your Heart Be Troubled\n, by Howard Lyon\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Nephi 1:13, 15, 23\nJesus Christ helps me overcome the effects of sin.\nTo help your children understand Lehi’s invitation to “shake off the chains” of sin, maybe you could work together to make a chain from slips of paper. On the slips, your children could help you write some things Satan tempts us to do. Then you could read together\n2 Nephi 1:13, 15, 23\nas they act out some of the phrases in these verses—including shaking off the paper chain. How is sin like a chain? How does Jesus help us “shake off the chains” of sin?\n2 Nephi 1:20\nI am blessed when I obey God’s commandments.\nWould it help your children to compare God’s commandments to shoes, hats, gloves, or other things that protect us? Maybe you could let them try on some as you talk about how the commandments protect us. Then you could read\n2 Nephi 1:20\n, emphasizing that we “prosper” (are blessed or protected) as we keep the commandments. Share an experience when you were blessed or protected by following the commandments.\nTo illustrate the difference between prospering and being cut off from God (see\n2 Nephi 1:20\n), you and your children could look at a healthy plant and a leaf or branch that has been cut off from the plant. Then your children could review choices that Nephi and his brothers made (see\n1 Nephi 2:11–16\n;\n3:5–7\n;\n18:9–11\n). What were the results of these choices? What choices help us stay connected to God?\n2 Nephi 2:11, 16, 27\nGod gave me the freedom to choose.\nTo help your children understand what Lehi taught about opposites and making choices, you could play a game in which you say a word (such as\nlight\n) and your children say its opposite (\ndark\n). Help them learn why opposites are part of God’s plan as you read together\n2 Nephi 2:11, 16\n. Then you could share stories about a child who is tempted to make a wrong choice. Your children could share what the opposite of the wrong choice is and act it out.\nTo learn about the difference between “liberty” and “captivity” (\n2 Nephi 2:27\n), your children could draw pictures of an animal in a cage and an animal in its natural environment. Which animal is free? Invite the children to point at the correct picture when you read the word “free” in\n2 Nephi 2:27\n. Testify that Jesus Christ makes us free.\nSing together a song like “\nChoose the Right\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 239). What do we learn from the song about making choices?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nLehi and His People Arrive in the New World\n, by Clark Kelley Price\nBuksan ang PDF"

Or at least that is what we might assume. While Nephi’s faith was remarkable, his tender words in\n2 Nephi 4\nreveal that even faithful people sometimes feel “wretched” and “easily beset” by temptations. Here we see someone who is trying, who wants to be joyful, but whose “heart groaneth because of [his] sins.” We can relate to this and to the hopeful determination that follows: “Nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted” (see\n2 Nephi 4:15–19\n).\nWhile Nephi and his people learned to live “after the manner of happiness” (\n2 Nephi 5:27\n), they also learned that happiness does not come easily or without periods of sorrow. It ultimately comes from trusting the Lord, “the rock of [our] righteousness” (\n2 Nephi 4:35\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Nephi 3:6–24\nJoseph Smith was chosen by God to restore the gospel.\nLehi shared with his son Joseph a prophecy given by Joseph of Egypt. The prophecy was about a future “choice seer,” Joseph Smith. What do\nverses 6–24\nsay that Joseph Smith would do to bless God’s people? Consider how Joseph Smith’s work has been “of great worth” to you. You might get some ideas from the videos about Joseph Smith in the “\nProphets of the Restoration\n” collection in the Gospel Library. Think about questions like these, and consider recording your answers:\nWhat do you know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ because of what Joseph Smith taught?\nHow is your life different because of what the Lord restored through Joseph Smith?\nWhat would your life be like if the Restoration had not happened?\nOne important part of Joseph Smith’s mission was to bring forth the Book of Mormon. What do you learn from this chapter about why the Book of Mormon is important? In particular, you could look for reasons in\nverses 7, 11–13, 18–24\n.\nSee also\nJoseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24–38\n(in the Bible appendix); Gospel Topics, “\nJoseph Smith\n,” Gospel Library; “\nPraise to the Man\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 27.\nProphet of the Lord\n, by David Lindsley\n2 Nephi 4:15–35\n“O Lord, I have trusted in thee.”\nNephi said that he would “write the things of my soul” (\nverse 15\n). As you read what he wrote in\n2 Nephi 4:15–35\n, ask yourself, “What are the things of\nmy\nsoul?” Consider writing them down, as Nephi did, and sharing them with people you love.\nSeeing how Nephi found comfort when he felt overwhelmed and anxious can help you when you have similar feelings. Look in\nverses 15–35\nfor passages that bring you comfort. Do you know someone else who might find comfort in these passages?\nSee also Ronald A. Rasband, “\nThe Things of My Soul\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 39–41.\n2 Nephi 5\nI can find happiness in living the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWhat do you think it means to be happy? Nephi wrote that his people lived “after the manner of happiness” (\n2 Nephi 5:27\n). You might look for choices Nephi and his people made that helped them be happy (see, for example\n2 Nephi 5:6, 10–17\n). What can help you build a life of happiness like the people of Nephi?\n2 Nephi 5:20–21\nWhat was the curse that came upon the Lamanites?\nIn Nephi’s day the curse of the Lamanites was that they were “cut off from [the Lord’s] presence … because of their iniquity” (\n2 Nephi 5:20–21\n). This meant that the Spirit of the Lord was withdrawn from their lives. When Lamanites later embraced the gospel of Jesus Christ, “the curse of God did no more follow them” (\nAlma 23:18\n).\nThe Book of Mormon also states that a mark of dark skin came upon the Lamanites after the Nephites separated from them. The nature and appearance of this mark are not fully understood. The mark initially distinguished the Lamanites from the Nephites. Later, as the Nephites and Lamanites each went through periods of wickedness and righteousness, the mark became irrelevant.\nProphets affirm in our day that dark skin is not a sign of divine disfavor or cursing. President Russell M. Nelson declared: “I assure you that your standing before God is not determined by the color of your skin. Favor or disfavor with God is dependent upon your devotion to God and His commandments and not the color of your skin” (“\nLet God Prevail\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 94).\nAs Nephi taught, the Lord “denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; … all are alike unto God” (\n2 Nephi 26:33\n).\nSee also “Till We All Come in the Unity of the Faith” (video), Gospel Library.\nTill We All Come in the Unity of the Faith\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Nephi 3:6–24\nJoseph Smith was a prophet.\nConsider how you can teach your children about the great work that God accomplished through Joseph Smith. To begin, you could help your children find the word “seer” in\n2 Nephi 3:6\nand explain that prophets are called seers because Heavenly Father helps them see things we can’t see. Share why you are grateful to have a seer leading the Church.\nThe\nGospel Art Book\nhas several pictures you could use to teach about the work God did through Joseph Smith (see\npictures 89–95\n). Let your children share what they know about the pictures. Why is Joseph Smith called a “choice seer”? What did Joseph Smith do that is “of great worth”? (\nverse 7\n).\n2 Nephi 4:15–35\n;\n5\nI love “the things of the Lord.”\nWhat makes us happy? Consider reading together verses from\n2 Nephi 4\nto find out what delighted Nephi or made him happy (see\nverses 15–16, 20–25, 34–35\n). In his message “\nThe Things of My Soul\n,” Elder Ronald A. Rasband shared seven “things of the Lord” that are precious to him (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 39–41). Perhaps you could review his list together and talk about “things of the Lord” that are precious to you.\n2 Nephi 5\nalso describes things that helped the Nephites live “after the manner of happiness” (\nverse 27\n). You could provide some words or pictures that represent these things and help your children match them to verses in\nchapter 5\n. Some examples include family (\nverse 6\n), God’s commandments (\nverse 10\n), the scriptures (\nverse 12\n), work (\nverses 15 and 17\n), temples (\nverse 16\n), and Church callings (\nverse 26\n). How do these things bring us happiness?\n2 Nephi 5:15–16\nThe temple is the house of the Lord.\nAs you read\n2 Nephi 5:15–16\nto your children, they could pretend they are helping Nephi build a temple. You could also show them pictures of different buildings, including a temple. How are temples different from other buildings? Share with each other why the temple is important to you (see also “\nI Love to See the Temple\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 95).\nA New Home in the Promised Land\nAny moment can be a teaching moment.\nDon’t think of teaching your family as something you do once a week during a formal lesson. Think of it as something you do all the time.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nThe Temple of Nephi\n, by Michael T.

They were in a strange new land, half a world away from Jerusalem. Lehi had died, and his family had already started what would become a centuries-long contention between the Nephites—“who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God”—and the Lamanites, who did not (\n2 Nephi 5:6\n). Jacob, who was Nephi’s younger brother and was now ordained as a teacher for the Nephites, wanted the covenant people to know that God would never forget them, so they must never forget Him. This is a message we surely need today (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:15–16\n). “Let us remember him … for we are not cast off. … Great are the promises of the Lord,” Jacob declared (\n2 Nephi 10:20–21\n). Among these promises, none is greater than the promise of an “infinite atonement” to overcome death and hell (\n2 Nephi 9:7\n). “Therefore,” Jacob concluded, “cheer up your hearts”! (\n2 Nephi 10:23\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Nephi 6–8\nThe Lord is merciful to His people and will fulfill His covenants.\nTo help his people understand that they were part of the house of Israel and could trust God and His promises, Jacob quoted prophecies of Isaiah, recorded in\n2 Nephi 6–8\n. That message is for you too, because Latter-day Saints are also part of God’s covenant people. As you read these chapters, think about questions like the following:\nWhat do I learn about the Savior’s redeeming love for me? What words or phrases express this love especially well?\nWhat does the Savior offer to people who seek Him?\nWhat can I do to more faithfully “wait” for the Savior and His promised blessings?\n2 Nephi 9:1–26\nJesus Christ saves me from sin and death.\nOne way to deepen your appreciation for Jesus Christ is to think about what would have happened to us without Him. As you read\n2 Nephi 9:1–26\n, consider listing or marking in one color what would happen to us without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Then, in another list or color, you could identify what we can receive through the Savior’s Atonement. Based on what you read, how would you explain why we need the Atonement of Jesus Christ? What did you find that inspires you to praise the “wisdom of God, his mercy and grace”? (\n2 Nephi 9:8\n).\nIn addition to teaching what Jesus Christ saved us from, Jacob also gave insights about how He did it. Consider recording what you find in\n2 Nephi 9:11–15, 20–24\n.\nJacob was so awed by God’s plan of redemption that he exclaimed, “O how great the plan of our God.” Look for his exclamations in\n2 Nephi 9\n(most of them are found in\nverses 8–20\n). What do you learn from these verses about God’s plan? What experiences have helped you feel some of what Jacob felt? As part of your worship and study, consider looking for a hymn that might express how you feel about Him, such as “\nHow Great Thou Art\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 86).\nSee also “Where Justice, Love, and Mercy Meet,” “Jacob Teaches of the Resurrection” (videos), Gospel Library; Gospel Topics, “\nAtonement of Jesus Christ\n,” Gospel Library.\nWhere Justice, Love, and Mercy Meet\nJacob Teaches of the Resurrection | 2 Nephi 6:5–11; 9\n2 Nephi 9:7\nThe Savior’s Atonement is infinite.\nWhat could you do to better understand Jesus Christ’s “infinite atonement”? (\n2 Nephi 9:7\n). Perhaps you could look at things that seem infinite in number—blades of grass in a field, grains of sand on a beach, or stars in the sky. How is the Savior’s Atonement infinite? How is it also personal? What phrases in\n2 Nephi 9\nhelp you feel grateful for what the Savior did for you?\n2 Nephi 9:27–54\nI can come unto Christ and follow God’s plan.\nIn\n2 Nephi 9\n, Jacob used two powerful and contrasting phrases: “the merciful plan of the great Creator” and “that cunning plan of the evil one” (\n2 Nephi 9:6, 28\n). Perhaps you could draw a path and label it\nHeavenly Father’s Plan\n. Then search\n2 Nephi 9:27–52\n. Look for warnings and invitations that Jacob gave to help us follow this plan. Write what you find beside the path. How does Satan try to lead us away from God’s plan? What do you feel inspired to do in response to Jacob’s warnings and invitations?\n2 Nephi 10:20, 23–25\nThe sacrifice of Jesus Christ can bring me joy.\nJacob’s message was a joyful one. “I speak unto you these things,” he said, “that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever” (\n2 Nephi 9:3\n). As you read\n2 Nephi 10:20, 23–25\n, what do you find that cheers your heart? What will you do to remember these things when you feel discouraged?\nSee also\nJohn 16:33\n; D. Todd Christofferson, “\nThe Joy of the Saints\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 15–18; “Jacob Encourages the Nephites to Be Reconciled with God” (video), Gospel Library.\nJacob Encourages the Nephites to Be Reconciled with God | 2 Nephi 10:3–25\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Nephi 9:6–10, 19–24\nJesus Christ is my Savior.\nHow will you help your children understand and feel that they need the Savior Jesus Christ? This week’s activity page could help. It uses a simple analogy of a pit and a ladder. Consider using\n2 Nephi 9:21–22\nto talk with your children about why you are grateful for Jesus Christ.\nOne way to help your children understand why we need the Savior is to teach them about the Fall.

So why would Nephi make the effort of copying so many of the writings of the prophet Isaiah into his record? He did it because he wanted us to believe in Jesus Christ. “My soul delighteth,” he wrote, “in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ” (\n2 Nephi 11:4\n). Nephi had seen what would happen to his people in future generations. He saw that, despite their great blessings, they would become prideful, contentious, and worldly (see\n1 Nephi 12\n;\n15:4–6\n). He also saw similar problems in our day (see\n1 Nephi 14\n). Isaiah’s writings warned against such wickedness. But they also gave Nephi hope for a glorious future—an end to wickedness, a gathering of the faithful, and “great light” for people who had “walked in darkness” (\n2 Nephi 19:2\n). All this would happen because “a child [was] born” who could end all strife—“The Prince of Peace” (\n2 Nephi 19:6\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHow can I better understand the teachings of Isaiah?\nNephi acknowledged that “the words of Isaiah are not plain” (\n2 Nephi 25:4\n). But he also shared ideas to help us find meaning in Isaiah’s writings:\n“\nLiken his words unto” yourself\n(\n2 Nephi 11:2\n). Many of Isaiah’s teachings have multiple possible meanings and applications. For example, when you read about dwelling places in\n2 Nephi 14:5–6\n, consider how these verses apply to your home. Ask yourself, “What does Heavenly Father want me to learn?”\nLook for symbols of Jesus Christ\n(see\n2 Nephi 11:4\n). Many of Isaiah’s teachings about the Savior are conveyed through symbols. For example, how is the Savior represented in\n2 Nephi 19:2\n? What does this symbol teach you about Him?\nSeek to be “filled with the spirit of prophecy\n” (\n2 Nephi 25:4\n). As you study, pray for spiritual guidance. You may not understand everything at first, but the Spirit can help you learn what you need to know.\nYou might also find it helpful to refer to the study helps in the scriptures, including the footnotes, chapter headings, and\nGuide to the Scriptures\n. The Book of Mormon and Old Testament institute manuals have additional information that can help you learn about the historical context of Isaiah’s teachings.\n2 Nephi 11–19\nIsaiah testified of Jesus Christ.\nBecause Isaiah used symbolic language, it can be easy to overlook his powerful witness of Jesus Christ. Look for the Savior in\n2 Nephi 13:13\n;\n14:4–6\n;\n15:1–7\n;\n16:1–7\n;\n17:14\n;\n18:14–15\n;\n22:2\n. What do these verses teach you about Him?\nThe prophecy in\n2 Nephi 19:6\nlists several of Jesus Christ’s titles. How has He fulfilled these roles in your life?\nSee also Ulisses Soares, “\nJesus Christ: The Caregiver of Our Soul\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 82–84.\n2 Nephi 12–13\n;\n15\nThe proud and worldly will be humbled.\nNephi had foreseen that pride would cause the downfall of his people (see\n1 Nephi 12:19\n). So it’s not surprising that Nephi would share with his people Isaiah’s repeated warnings against pride. In\nchapters 12\nand\n13\n, look for words that Isaiah used to describe pridefulness, such as\nlofty\nand\nhaughty\n. In\n2 Nephi 15:1–24\n, look for symbolic language describing the results of pride. Then you might try to summarize what you have read in your own words. Think about how you will choose to be humble.\nSee also “\nChapter 18: Beware of Pride,\n”\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson\n(2014), 229–40.\n2 Nephi 12:2–3\nThe temple is the house of the Lord.\nIsaiah called the temple “the mountain of the Lord’s house” (\n2 Nephi 12:2\n). Why is a mountain a good symbol for the temple?\nHow would you explain to someone why we need temples? You could find some possible answers in\n2 Nephi 12:2–3\nand President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nThe Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 93–96). Based on what you read, what does the Lord want you to learn and experience in His holy house? What experiences have you had there?\nYou can find the temple recommend interview questions on\npages 36–37\nof\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n. Consider reading each one and asking yourself, what does this question teach me about the Lord’s ways? How does it help me “walk in his ways”?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nTemples\n,” Gospel Library; “\nHigh on the Mountain Top\n,”\nHymns\n, no 5.\n2 Nephi 12–19\nJesus Christ will redeem His people.\nDespite the wickedness he observed, Isaiah saw hope for the future. Consider studying each of the following passages. Write one or more truths each passage teaches about our day:\n2 Nephi 12:1–5\n;\n14:2–6\n;\n15:20–26\n;\n19:2–8\n. Why do you feel these passages are important for us to understand?\nLook for patterns.\nIn the scriptures we can find patterns that show us how the Lord works. In\n2 Nephi 11–19\n, you might look for patterns that show how the Lord warns of sin and forgives people who repent.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Nephi 12:2–3\nThe temple is the house of the Lord.\nIsaiah described the temple as “the mountain of the Lord’s house.” Your children might enjoy pretending to climb a mountain as you read\n2 Nephi 12:2–3\n. Help them find phrases in these verses that describe why we have temples.\nTo illustrate the phrase “we will walk in his paths” from\n2 Nephi 12:3\n, you could make a path on the floor, leading to a picture of a temple. As your children walk on the path, they could name things they can do to walk in the Lord’s paths.\nPerhaps your children could draw a picture of themselves going to the temple. They could also sing or listen to a song about the temple, such as “\nI Love to See the Temple\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 95). Help them find phrases in the song that teach what the temple is and what we do there.\n2 Nephi 11:4–7\n;\n17:14\n;\n19:6\nJesus Christ is my Savior.\nThere are several names for Jesus Christ in\n2 Nephi 11:4–7\n;\n17:14\n;\n19:6\n.

      "plain_text": "“March 4–10: ‘We Rejoice in Christ.’ 2 Nephi 20–25,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Book of Mormon 2024\n(2023)\n“March 4–10. 2 Nephi 20–25\n,” Come, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nMarch 4–10: “We Rejoice in Christ”\n2 Nephi 20–25\nThe writings of Isaiah include strong warnings, but they also offer hope and joy. This is one reason Nephi included them in his record: “I write some of the words of Isaiah,” he said, “that whoso … shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice” (\n2 Nephi 11:8\n). In a sense, the invitation to read Isaiah’s writings is an invitation to rejoice. You can take delight, as Nephi did, in Isaiah’s prophecies about the gathering of Israel, the coming of the Messiah, and the peace promised to the righteous. You can rejoice to live in the prophesied day when the Lord has “set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel” (\n2 Nephi 21:12\n). When you thirst after righteousness, you can “with joy … draw water out of the wells of salvation” (\n2 Nephi 22:3\n). In other words, you can “rejoice in Christ” (\n2 Nephi 25:26\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Nephi 21–22\nI can find peace in Jesus Christ.\nLehi’s children had a problem with contention. The problem got worse in future generations, leading to division, captivity, sorrow, and destruction. And contention continues to be a problem today.\nWith all of that in mind, think about the prophecies in\n2 Nephi 21–22\n. Consider how the Savior is fulfilling these prophecies. What does the prophecy that the wolf will “dwell with the lamb” mean to you? (\n2 Nephi 21:6\n). Ponder what you can do to be a peacemaker.\nSee also Dale G. Renlund, “\nThe Peace of Christ Abolishes Enmity\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 83–85.\n2 Nephi 21:9–12\nThe Lord is gathering His people.\nNephi and his family were witnesses to the scattering of Israel (see\n2 Nephi 25:10\n). Now you can participate in the gathering of Israel (see\n2 Nephi 21:12\n). As you read\n2 Nephi 21:9–12\n, think about how you can help fulfill the prophecies these verses describe.\nFor example, as you read about the “ensign” (standard or banner) that will be raised to gather God’s people, think about how you have seen God gather His people, physically and spiritually. What attracts people to the Lord and His Church?\nWhat do you feel inspired to do to help gather God’s people?\n2 Nephi 23–24\nThe worldliness of Babylon will fall.\nThe kingdom of Babylon was a mighty political and military threat to ancient Israel. But to Nephi’s people—and to us today—the bigger threat is what Babylon represents: worldliness and sin. Consider how the warnings in\n2 Nephi 23–24\nmight have affected people who feared or admired or trusted Babylon’s wealth and power (see, for example\n23:6–9, 11, 19–22\n;\n24:10–19\n). What are some similar things we might fear or admire or trust today? What do you feel the Savior’s message to you might be in these chapters? Think about how you can show that you “rejoice in [the Lord’s] highness” (\n2 Nephi 23:3\n).\n2 Nephi 25:19–29\n“We talk of Christ … we rejoice in Christ.”\nNephi was open about sharing his beliefs—especially his testimony of Jesus Christ. Throughout your study of\n2 Nephi 25\n, think about Nephi’s desire to “persuade [his] children … to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God” (\nverse 23\n). What did Nephi want people to know about the Savior? (see\nverses 12–13, 16\n). How did Nephi try to persuade people to believe in Him? (see\nverses 19–29\n). Note passages in this chapter that persuade you to believe in and follow Jesus Christ.\nSome of us may not feel as bold as Nephi was about talking of Christ. But maybe you can find something in Nephi’s teachings in\n2 Nephi 25:23–26\nthat inspires you to talk about Him with others more openly. For example, Nephi’s declaration “We rejoice in Christ” might prompt you to think about how the Savior brings you joy—and how you can share that joy with others.\nIn his message “\nWe Talk of Christ\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 88–91), Elder Neil L. Andersen suggests how we can speak more openly of Christ in various settings. Which of his suggestions stand out to you? What opportunities do you have to talk of Christ with others?\nWhat do you feel inspired to tell others about Jesus Christ? If you need some ideas, you might search “\nThe Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles\n” (Gospel Library). A hymn like “\nI Believe in Christ\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 134) could give you more ideas.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Nephi 21:1–5\nJesus Christ will judge in righteousness.\nTo help your children visualize these verses, see if you can find a tree that has been cut down or a branch growing from a tree (or use the picture below). If the “branch” in\n2 Nephi 21:1\nrepresents Jesus Christ, what do\nverses 2–5\nteach us about Him?\n2 Nephi 21:6–9\nJesus Christ brings peace and joy.\nWhat does\n2 Nephi 21:6–9\nteach about what can happen when everyone follows the Savior? (see also\n4 Nephi 1:15–18\n). How can we make our home more like this? Your children might enjoy looking at pictures of the animals mentioned in\nverses 6–7\n—animals that are usually enemies but will not hurt each other when Jesus comes again (see this week’s activity page).

In other words, he was writing about our day. And there’s reason to be concerned about what he saw: people denying the power and miracles of God; widespread jealousy and conflict. But in addition to these latter-day “works of darkness” (\n2 Nephi 26:10, 22\n) led by the adversary, Nephi also spoke of “a marvelous work and a wonder” led by God Himself (\n2 Nephi 27:26\n). Central to that work would be a book—a book that exposes Satan’s lies and gathers the righteous. That book is the Book of Mormon, the marvelous work is the work of the Lord’s Church in the latter days, and the wonder is—at least in part—that God invites all of us, despite our weaknesses, to participate in the gathering.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Nephi 26–27\n;\n29–30\nGod prepared the Book of Mormon for our day.\nIn\n2 Nephi 26–27\n, Nephi quoted from an earlier prophecy of Isaiah (see\nIsaiah 29\n) and applied it to his people and their record—the Book of Mormon. He knew by revelation, even before the Book of Mormon had been completely written, that it would one day “be of great worth unto the children of men” (\n2 Nephi 28:2\n). Why is the Book of Mormon of great worth to you? Think about this question as you read\n2 Nephi 29–30\n. What “marvelous work” (\n2 Nephi 27:26\n) is God accomplishing in the world and in your life through the Book of Mormon?\nSee also\nJoseph Smith—History 1:62–65\n.\n2 Nephi 26:23–33\nJesus Christ invites us all to come unto Him.\nThere are many beautiful truths to consider in\n2 Nephi 26:23–24\n. For example, you could think about what Jesus Christ has done “for the benefit of the world”—and for you. How does He “draw all men”—and you—“unto him”? What do you feel inspired to do in response to His expressions of love?\nKeep reading and looking for truths about the Savior in\nverses 25–33\n. Notice in particular His invitations. How would you summarize Jesus Christ’s message to you in one sentence? A hymn like “\nCome unto Jesus\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 117) could open your mind to additional impressions.\nConsider how these verses might influence the way you interact with others and invite them to come unto Christ. You might find some ideas in Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nThe Doctrine of Belonging\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 53–56).\nSee also\n3 Nephi 18:30–32\n; Dallin H. Oaks, “\nWhat Has Our Savior Done for Us?\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 75–77; Gospel Topics, “Belonging in the Church of Jesus Christ,” Gospel Library.\nDon’t be afraid of silence.\nGood questions take time to answer. They require searching, thinking, and inspiration. The time you spend waiting for answers to a question can be a sacred time of pondering. Avoid the temptation to end this time too soon by moving on to something else.\n2 Nephi 28\nSatan seeks to deceive.\nMany of Satan’s lies and tactics are exposed in\n2 Nephi 28\n. Look for them in\nverses 6, 8, 21–23, 29\n. Why do you need to know about Satan’s lies? What will you do when the adversary tries to deceive you?\nListed below are some scriptures that reject Satan’s lies. See if you can match the true doctrine in these verses with the false doctrine Nephi warns us about in\n2 Nephi 28\n:\n2 Nephi 2:17\n: there is a devil (\n2 Nephi 28:22\n: “I am no devil, for there is none”)\nMoroni 7:35–37\nDoctrine and Covenants 1:31\nDoctrine and Covenants 68:31\n;\n82:14\nArticles of Faith 1:9\nSee also Gary E. Stevenson, “\nDeceive Me Not\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 93–96.\n2 Nephi 28:27–31\n;\n29\nGod continues to give revelation to guide His children.\nAs Latter-day Saints, we are blessed with an abundance of the word of God. And yet, as Nephi warned, we must never feel that “we have enough!” As you read the warnings in\n2 Nephi 28:27–31\nand\n2 Nephi 29\n, think about questions like these:\nHow does God want me to feel about and respond to His word?\nWhy are people sometimes “angry” about receiving more truth from God? (\n2 Nephi 28:28\n). Do I ever feel this way? If so, how can I change?\nWhat does it mean to receive God’s word? How can I show Him that I want to receive more of His word?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n2 Nephi 26:23–28, 33\nJesus Christ wants everyone to come unto Him.\nTo teach your children about the Savior’s invitations in these verses, you might talk with them about times they invited people to a special event, like a birthday party. Then you could read\n2 Nephi 26:23–28\ntogether and find out what Jesus is inviting us to do. Your children might like to create a card inviting someone to come unto Jesus Christ. Encourage them to use a phrase from these verses in their invitation.\nThe painting at the end of this outline shows people from many backgrounds. Maybe your children could look at this picture as you read\n2 Nephi 26:33\n. You could repeat the phrase “Jesus invites all to come unto Him” as your children point to each person in the picture—and then to themselves. How do we come unto Jesus?\nA song about loving all people, such as “\nI’ll Walk with You\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 140–41), could help you teach the message of\n2 Nephi 26:33\n.\n2 Nephi 28:2\n;\n29:7–11\n;\n30:3–6\nThe Book of Mormon is a blessing.\nTo help your children feel that the Book of Mormon is “of great worth” (\n2 Nephi 28:2\n), you could wrap a copy as a gift and let them guess what’s inside. They could look for clues in\n2 Nephi 30:3–6\n. Tell your children why the Book of Mormon is of great worth to you, and let them share their feelings too.\nConsider asking your children to imagine that a friend says, “I don’t need to read the Book of Mormon. I’ve already read the Bible.” What could we say to our friend? Read together\n2 Nephi 29:7–11\nto learn why God wants us to have both books.\n2 Nephi 28:30–31\nHeavenly Father teaches me little by little.\nPerhaps you can think of an object lesson that will help your children understand what it means to learn “line upon line.” For example, they could put together a puzzle or build something with blocks, one piece at a time. Or you could teach them a skill step by step, such as tying a bow or drawing a picture. You could then read\n2 Nephi 28:30\nand discuss how Heavenly Father teaches us one truth at a time.\nAnother idea could be to choose a phrase from\n2 Nephi 28:30\nand take turns writing it, one word at a time.

This is a good summary of Nephi’s life. He tried to understand the will of God and courageously obeyed it—whether that meant risking his life to get the brass plates from Laban, building a boat and crossing the sea, or faithfully teaching the doctrine of Christ with plainness and power. Nephi could speak persuasively of the need to “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ,” of following the “strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life” (\n2 Nephi 31:20, 18\n), because that is the path he followed. He knew by experience that this path, though demanding at times, is also joyful, and that “there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God” (\n2 Nephi 31:21\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n2 Nephi 31\nJesus Christ and His doctrine are the only way to eternal life.\nIf you had to summarize the path to eternal life in just a few words, what would you say? Notice how Nephi described it in\n2 Nephi 31\n. Consider drawing a path and writing along the path some of the principles or steps you find in these chapters. You could add to your drawing your own summary of what Nephi taught about each principle.\nAs you read\n2 Nephi 31:18–20\n, evaluate your own efforts to “press forward” along the gospel path.\nSee also “\nPress Forward, Saints\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 81; “Nephi Teaches the Doctrine of Christ” (video), Gospel Library.\nNephi Teaches the Doctrine of Christ | 2 Nephi 31–32\nFollowing Jesus Christ’s teachings leads us to eternal life.\n2 Nephi 31:4–13\nJesus Christ set the perfect example of obedience when He was baptized.\nWhether your baptism happened yesterday or a long time ago, it was an important moment. You entered an eternal covenant to follow Jesus Christ. Think about your baptism as you read about the Savior’s baptism in\n2 Nephi 31:4–13\n. Answering questions like these may help:\nWhy was Christ baptized? Why did I choose to be baptized?\nWhat promises did I make when I was baptized? What does the Lord promise in return? (see\nverses 12–13\n; see also\nMosiah 18:10, 13\n).\nHow can I show that I am still committed to following Jesus Christ?\n2 Nephi 31:15–20\n“He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.”\nAs you read\n2 Nephi 31:15–20\n, ask yourself, “How do I know if I am enduring to the end?” What do you learn from Nephi that helps you answer this question?\nElder Dale G. Renlund taught: “Enduring to the end is not a separate step in the doctrine of Christ—as though we complete the first four steps and then hunker down, grit our teeth, and wait to die. No, enduring to the end is actively and intentionally repeating the steps” (“\nLifelong Conversion\n” [Brigham Young University devotional, Sept. 14, 2021], 2, speeches.byu.edu). How can you repeat the steps in the doctrine of Christ (faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost)?\n2 Nephi 32\n;\n33:2\nThrough the words of Christ and the Holy Ghost, God will show me what to do.\nHave you ever felt uncertain about the next steps in your life? Nephi’s people had similar concerns (see\n2 Nephi 32:1\n). Look for Nephi’s answer in\n2 Nephi 32:2–9\n. How would you state in your own words what Nephi taught? What experiences have taught you that Nephi’s words are true?\nConsider making a list of decisions or situations (now and in the future) in which you need God’s guidance. What can you learn from\n2 Nephi 32\nthat will help you succeed in receiving inspiration from Him? What might lead people to “harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit”? (\n2 Nephi 33:2\n).\nAs you ponder Nephi’s counsel, think about how you study the Savior’s words. Would you describe it as snacking, eating, or feasting? What’s the difference, in your opinion? Consider how you can make your experience with the Savior’s words more like a feast.

      "plain_text": "“March 25–31: ‘He Shall Rise … with Healing in His Wings.’ Easter,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Book of Mormon 2024\n(2023)\n“March 25–31. Easter,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nChrist and the Apostles\n, by Del Parson\nMarch 25–31: “He Shall Rise … with Healing in His Wings”\nEaster\nThe ancient Apostles were bold in their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Resurrection (see\nActs 4:33\n). Millions of people believe in Jesus Christ and try to follow Him because of their words recorded in the Bible. Yet some people might wonder: If Jesus Christ is the Savior of the whole world, then why were His eyewitnesses limited to a handful of people in one small region?\nThe Book of Mormon stands as an additional, convincing witness that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, “manifesting himself unto all nations” (\ntitle page of the Book of Mormon\n) and offering salvation to all who come unto Him. In addition, this second witness also makes it clear what salvation means. This is why Nephi, Jacob, Mormon, and all the prophets labored so “diligently to engraven these words upon plates”—to declare to future generations that they too “knew of Christ, and … had a hope of his glory” (\nJacob 4:3–4\n). This Easter season, reflect on the testimonies in the Book of Mormon that the Savior’s power is both universal and personal—redeeming the whole world and redeeming you.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I will be resurrected.\nIt’s traditional at Easter to ponder the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, but what exactly does it mean to be resurrected? What insights does the Book of Mormon offer about resurrection? Perhaps this Easter season you could list truths about resurrection that you find in\n2 Nephi 9:6–15, 22\n;\nAlma 11:42–45\n;\n40:21–25\n;\n3 Nephi 26:4–5\n.\nYou could also record how these truths about resurrection influence your actions and the way you live. For example, consider how you would complete these sentences:\nIf I did not know these things …\nand\nBecause I know these things …\nA hymn like “\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 136) could help you think about why the Savior’s Resurrection is important to you. As you sing, listen to, or read the hymn, you might ask yourself, “How is my life different because Jesus Christ was resurrected?”\nThe Gospel Library has a collection of\nEaster videos\nthat could be a meaningful part of your study. Perhaps you could watch one or more of these videos and ponder what they add to your understanding or appreciation of the Savior’s Resurrection.\nSee also\nLuke 24:36–43\n;\nActs 24:15\n;\n1 Corinthians 15:12–23\n; Reyna I. Aburto, “\nThe Grave Has No Victory\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 85–86; Gospel Topics, “\nResurrection\n,” Gospel Library; “\nDeath, Grieving, and Loss\n” in the “Life Help” collection in Gospel Library.\nJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins, pains, and infirmities.\nThe Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ atoned for our sins. The Book of Mormon expands our understanding of Christ’s sacrifice and suffering in important ways. You can find some of these teachings in\nMosiah 3:7\n;\n15:5–9\n;\nAlma 7:11–13\n. After you read these passages, consider recording what you discover in a chart like this one:\nWhat did the Savior suffer?\nWhy did He suffer?\nWhat does this mean to me?\nHere’s another way to study these passages: Look for hymns that you feel match the messages they teach. The “Scriptures” index at the back of the hymnbook can help. What phrases from these hymns and the scriptures help you appreciate the Savior’s sacrifice more deeply?\nSee also\nIsaiah 53\n;\nHebrews 4:14–16\n; Gérald Caussé, “\nA Living Witness of the Living Christ\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 38–40.\nJesus Christ can cleanse me and help perfect me.\nIt could be said that the Book of Mormon is an account of people who changed because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. You can read some of these experiences in\nMosiah 5:1–2\n;\n27:8–28\n;\nAlma 15:3–12\n;\n24:7–19\n. You might think of other examples to study as well. What do you notice that these experiences have in common? What differences do you notice? What do these experiences teach you about how the Savior can change you?\nSee also\nAlma 5:6–14\n;\n13:11–12\n;\n19:1–16\n;\n22:1–26\n;\n36:16–21\n;\nEther 12:27\n;\nMoroni 10:32–33\n.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nBecause Jesus Christ was resurrected, I will be resurrected too.\nYou can use “\nChapter 53: Jesus Is Crucified\n” and “\nChapter 54: Jesus Is Risen\n” (in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 136–38, 139–44) to tell your children about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Or let your children tell you the story, using the pictures in these chapters.\nThe Risen Savior’s visit to the Americas is a powerful witness of His Resurrection. Consider telling your children about it, using\n3 Nephi 11\n;\n17\n; the song “\nEaster Hosanna\n”; or the last verse of “\nBook of Mormon Stories\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 68–69, 118–19). Encourage your children to imagine what it would have been like to feel Jesus’s wounds (see\n3 Nephi 11:14–15\n) or to be one of the children He blessed (see\n3 Nephi 17:21\n). Share with each other your feelings about Jesus Christ and His Resurrection.\nTo help your children discover what the Book of Mormon teaches about resurrection, you could invite them to pretend that you don’t know anything about it and ask them to explain it to you. Help them look in\n2 Nephi 9:10–15\n;\nAlma 11:41–45\n; and\nAlma 40:21–23\nfor answers to questions like these: What does it mean to be resurrected? Who will be resurrected? Also invite them to bear testimony of the Savior’s Resurrection as part of their answer.\nJesus Christ knows how to comfort me.\nMosiah 3:7\nand\nAlma 7:11\ndescribe some of what the Savior went through as part of His Atonement. You might read one of these verses to your children and ask them to listen for words that tell them what Jesus suffered for us. Then you could read\nAlma 7:12\nto find out why He suffered it. Testify that Jesus Christ felt all of our pains and sicknesses so that He could comfort us.\nDo your children have a favorite hymn or song about Jesus Christ and His Atonement? You could sing it together—or learn a new one. Talk about words or phrases in the lyrics that teach you about the comfort and peace the Savior offers us.\nGethsemane\n, by Michael T. Malm\nJesus Christ can cleanse me and help me change.\nThe Book of Mormon gives many examples of people who were changed because of the Savior’s Atonement. Perhaps your children could choose one to learn about, such as Enos (see\nEnos 1:2–8\n), Alma the Younger (see\nMosiah 27:8–24\n), or the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (see\nAlma 24:7–19\n). How did this person or group change because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ? How can we follow their examples?\nYou and your children could also compare something clean and something dirty and talk about how dirty things are made clean. Read together\nAlma 13:11–13\n. What did Jesus do so that we can be made clean from our sins? How does this make us feel about sin? How does it make us feel about the Savior?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nLive worthy of the Spirit’s guidance.\nThe Spirit is the real teacher.

Jacob 1–4,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nForgiven\n, by Greg Olsen. Used with permission. www.GregOlsen.com\nApril 1–7: Be Reconciled unto God through the Atonement of Christ\nJacob 1–4\nThe Nephites considered Nephi their “great protector” (see\nJacob 1:10\n). He had also protected them against spiritual dangers, warning them against sin and urging them to come unto Christ. Now that task fell to Jacob, whom Nephi had consecrated to be a priest and teacher (see\nJacob 1:18\n). Jacob felt a responsibility to boldly warn those who were “beginning to labor in sin” while also comforting “the wounded soul” of those who had been hurt by the sins of others (see\nJacob 2:5–9\n). How would he do both? He would point them to Jesus Christ—because both groups needed the Savior’s healing (see\nJacob 4\n). Like the message of Nephi before him, Jacob’s testimony was a call to “be reconciled unto [God] through the atonement of Christ” (\nJacob 4:11\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJacob 1:6–8, 15–19\n;\n2:1–11\nI have an “errand from the Lord.”\nTo Jacob, teaching the word of God was an “errand from the Lord,” so he labored diligently to “magnify [his] office” (\nJacob 1:17, 19\n). What do these phrases that Jacob used mean to you? Think about what a magnifying glass does. Does that give you any ideas? As you ponder\nJacob 1:6–8, 15–19\nand\n2:1–11\n, think about the errands the Lord might have for you. What do you feel inspired to do to “magnify” them?\nSee also “\nWhom the Lord Calls, the Lord Qualifies\n,” in\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Thomas S. Monson\n(2022), 209–20; “Rise to Your Call” (video), Gospel Library.\nRise To Your Call\nJacob 2:12–21\n“Let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!”\nThe Nephites had a problem with pride and focusing on riches (see\nJacob 2:13\n), and that problem wasn’t unique to them or their day. How does the adversary promote the love of riches today? After reading\nJacob 2:12–21\n, describe in your own words how God wants you to view material wealth. A hymn like “\nBecause I Have Been Given Much\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 219) could provide additional insights.

God knows and loves His children, and He will prepare a way for each of them to hear His gospel, even those who have rejected Him in the past (see\nJacob 4:15–18\n). And then, when the work is done, all those who have been “diligent in laboring with [Him] … shall have joy with [Him] because of the fruit of [His] vineyard” (\nJacob 5:75\n).\nSee also “Jacob Teaches the Allegory of the Olive Trees” (video), Gospel Library.\nJacob Teaches the Allegory of the Olive Tree\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nJacob 5\nJesus Christ is the Lord of the vineyard.\nJacob 5\nis a story with symbolic meaning.

Enos–Words of Mormon,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nJacob and Enos\n, by Scott Snow\nApril 15–21: “He Worketh in Me to Do According to His Will”\nEnos–Words of Mormon\nAlthough Enos went to the forest to hunt beasts to satisfy physical hunger, he ended up staying there all day and into the night because his “soul hungered.” This hunger led Enos to “raise [his] voice high that it reached the heavens.” He described this experience as a wrestle before God (see\nEnos 1:2–4\n). From Enos we learn that prayer is a sincere effort to draw near to God and seek to know His will. When you pray with this intent, you are more likely to discover, as Enos did, that God hears you and truly cares about you, your loved ones, and even your enemies (see\nEnos 1:4–17\n). When you know His will, you are better able to do His will. Like Mormon, you may “not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things … ; wherefore, he worketh in [you] to do according to his will” (\nWords of Mormon 1:7\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEnos 1:1–17\nGod will hear and answer my prayers.\nYour experiences with prayer may be less dramatic than Enos’s, but they don’t have to be less meaningful. Here are some questions to think about as you study\nEnos 1:1–17\n:\nWhat words describe Enos’s efforts as he prayed?\nHow did Enos’s prayers change from\nverses 4 to 11\n?\nWhat do I learn from Enos that can help me improve my prayers?\nSee also “Enos Prays Mightily” (video), Gospel Library; “\nSweet Hour of Prayer\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 142.\nEnos Prays Mightily | Enos 1\nSharing discussion questions.\nIf you are teaching others, consider putting the questions you’d like to discuss in a prominent place so everyone can see them. This helps people ponder the questions and give more inspired answers.\nEnos 1:1–4\nThe Lord can help me influence my family for good.\nMaybe there’s someone in your family who you wish you could help come unto Christ, but you wonder if your efforts are making any difference. What can you learn from\nEnos 1:1–4\nabout Jacob’s influence on his son Enos? For example, what does the phrase “the nurture and admonition of the Lord” mean to you?

Perhaps you decided, because of what you heard, to live a little differently—or even a lot differently. King Benjamin’s sermon was that kind of sermon, and the truths he taught had that kind of effect on the people who heard them. King Benjamin shared with his people what an angel had taught him—that wonderful blessings were possible through “the atoning blood of Christ” (\nMosiah 4:2\n). Because of His message, they changed their view of themselves (see\nMosiah 4:2\n), the Spirit changed their desires (see\nMosiah 5:2\n), and they covenanted with God that they would always do His will (see\nMosiah 5:5\n). This is how King Benjamin’s words affected his people. How will they affect you?\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMosiah 4\nThrough Jesus Christ, I can receive and retain a remission of my sins.\nSometimes, even when you have felt forgiven of your sins, you might struggle to keep that feeling and stay on the path of righteousness.

Brigham Young University Museum of Art, 1969.\nMay 6–12: “In the Strength of the Lord”\nMosiah 7–10\nWhile King Mosiah’s people were enjoying “continual peace” in Zarahemla (\nMosiah 7:1\n), their thoughts turned to another group of Nephites, who many years before had left to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi. Generations had passed, and Mosiah’s people had heard nothing from them. So, Mosiah asked Ammon to lead a search party to find the Nephites who had left. The search party found that these Nephites, “because of iniquity” (\nMosiah 7:24\n), were in captivity to the Lamanites. But with the arrival of Ammon and his brethren, suddenly there was hope for deliverance.\nSometimes we’re like these captive Nephites, suffering because of our sins, wondering how we’ll ever find peace again. Sometimes we’re like Ammon, feeling prompted to reach out to others and eventually finding that our efforts have inspired them to “lift up [their] heads, and rejoice, and put [their] trust in God” (\nMosiah 7:19\n). No matter our circumstances, we all need to repent and “turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart,” with faith that “he will … deliver [us]” (\nMosiah 7:33\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMosiah 7:14–33\nJesus Christ has the power to deliver me.\nMeeting Ammon gave King Limhi hope, and he wanted to pass that hope on to his people. Maybe his words can give you hope too. For context, consider reviewing the situation of Limhi’s people in\nMosiah 7:20–25\n. Then ponder these questions as you read\nMosiah 7:14–33\n:\nWhat did Limhi say to strengthen his people’s faith and hope in Christ?\nWhat phrases help you feel hope?

        "While you’re studying Mosiah 11–13 ; 17 , look at the pictures of Abinadi in this outline. What do you learn about standing as a witness for Christ? In particular, you could focus your study on passages and questions like these:",
        "When have you felt like you were standing alone in defense of the Savior and His gospel? How did He help you feel He was with you? As you ponder this, you could read the account of Elisha and his young servant in 2 Kings 6:14–17 . What inspires you about this account?",
        "You could also search pages 31–33 of For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices to find phrases that give you courage to defend the truth. Or you could do the same in the lyrics of a hymn like “ Do What Is Right ” or “ Let Us All Press On ” ( Hymns , nos. 237, 243).",
        "How will you apply what you learned from Abinadi? The video “Dare to Stand Alone” (Gospel Library) portrays situations in which you can stand for Christ and His gospel. What other examples can you think of?",
        "See also Romans 1:16 ; 2 Timothy 1:7–8 ; “ Chapter 8: The Call for Courage ,” Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Thomas S. Monson (2022), 135–47; Gospel Topics, “ Faith in Jesus Christ ,” Gospel Library.",
        "King Noah’s priests were familiar with the word of God. They could quote passages of scripture and claimed to teach the commandments. And yet, their lives seemed unaffected by the Savior’s gospel. Why was that?",
        "Think about this as you read Mosiah 12:19–37 . What do you think it means to apply your heart to understanding God’s word? What words or phrases inspire you to make changes in the way you approach learning the gospel?",
        "Ponder Abinadi’s observation that the commandments were “not written in [the] hearts” of the priests ( Mosiah 13:11 ). What might this phrase mean? As you read Mosiah 13:11–26 , consider whether these commandments are written in your heart.",
        "See also Jeremiah 31:31–34 ; 2 Corinthians 3:3 .",
        "In Mosiah 14–15 , notice words and phrases that describe the Savior and what He suffered for you. Which verses help deepen your love and gratitude toward Him?",
        "Abinadi taught that God the Son—Jesus Christ—would be the Redeemer (see Mosiah 15:1 ), dwelling in the flesh, becoming both man and God ( verses 2–3 ). He completely subjected Himself to the will of God the Father ( verses 5–9 ). Because of this, Jesus Christ is both the Son of God and the perfect earthly representation of God the Father (see John 14:6–10 ).",
        "Jesus Christ is also the Father in the sense that when we accept His redemption, we become “his seed” and “heirs of the kingdom of God” ( Mosiah 15:11–12 ). In other words, we become spiritually reborn through Him (see Mosiah 5:7 ).",
        "Why do you feel it’s important to know these truths about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? How does Abinadi’s testimony strengthen your faith in Them?"

Abinadi was only one man testifying against a powerful king and his court. His words were rejected for the most part, and he was sentenced to death. Yet his testimony of Jesus Christ, who is the “light … that can never be darkened” (\nMosiah 16:9\n), sparked something inside the young priest Alma. And that spark of conversion slowly grew as Alma brought many others to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The flames that killed Abinadi eventually died out, but the fire of faith that his words created would have a lasting influence on the Nephites—and on people who read his words today. Most of us will never face quite what Abinadi did because of our testimonies, but we all have moments when following Jesus Christ is a test of our courage and faith. Perhaps studying Abinadi’s testimony will fan the flames of testimony and courage in your heart as well.\nSee also “Abinadi Testifies of Jesus Christ” (video), Gospel Library.\nAbinadi Testifies of Jesus Christ | Mosiah 11–18\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMosiah 11–13\n;\n17\nI can stand for Jesus Christ, even when I stand alone.\nWhile you’re studying\nMosiah 11–13\n;\n17\n, look at the pictures of Abinadi in this outline.

        "Consider how deeply the believers described in Mosiah 18 felt about Jesus Christ. They had to meet secretly, at great risk, to learn about Him (see verse 3 ). And when given the chance to show their commitment by the covenant of baptism, “they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts” ( Mosiah 18:11 ).",

        "Answering these questions might lead you to ponder why covenants and ordinances are important to God. You could find insights in Elder Gerrit W.

Bingham’s message “ Covenants with God Strengthen, Protect, and Prepare Us for Eternal Glory ” ( Liahona , May 2022, 66–69). Why are you grateful for your covenants? What are you doing to keep your promises?",

        "How would you respond to a friend or family member who doesn’t believe that an organized church is necessary? Why are you grateful to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ?",

When Alma’s people were baptized, they made a covenant with God to “serve him and keep his commandments” (\nMosiah 18:10\n). While this was a personal commitment with God, it also had to do with how they treated one another. Yes, the journey back to Heavenly Father is individual, and no one can keep our covenants for us, but that doesn’t mean we are alone. We need each other. As members of Christ’s Church, we covenant to serve God by helping and serving one another along the way, “bear[ing] one another’s burdens” (\nMosiah 18:8–10\n). Alma’s people definitely had burdens to bear, just as we all do. And one way the Lord helps us “bear up [our] burdens with ease” (\nMosiah 24:15\n) is by giving us a community of Saints who have promised to mourn with us and comfort us, just as we have promised to do for them.\nSee also “The Lord Delivers the Covenant Peoples of Alma and Limhi” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Lord Delivers the People of Limhi and Alma\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMosiah 18:1–17\nWhen I am baptized, I make a covenant with God.\nConsider how deeply the believers described in\nMosiah 18\nfelt about Jesus Christ. They had to meet secretly, at great risk, to learn about Him (see\nverse 3\n). And when given the chance to show their commitment by the covenant of baptism, “they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts” (\nMosiah 18:11\n).\nReading these verses could be a good opportunity to ponder how important your covenants are to you. As you study\nMosiah 18:8–14\nin particular, consider questions like these:\nWhat do you learn from these verses about the promises you made at baptism? What does God promise you? (see\nverses 10, 13\n).\nHow does the covenant to serve God relate to our efforts to minister to one another? (see\nverses 8–9\n).\nWhat does it mean to you to “stand as [a witness] of God”? (\nverse 9\n).\nHow does keeping your baptismal covenant help you be “filled with the Spirit”? (\nMosiah 18:14\n). How does the Spirit help you keep your covenant?\nAnswering these questions might lead you to ponder why covenants and ordinances are important to God. You could find insights in Elder Gerrit W.

Mosiah 25–28,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nConversion of Alma the Younger\n, by Gary L. Kapp\nMay 27–June 2: “They Were Called the People of God”\nMosiah 25–28\nAfter nearly three generations of living in separate lands, the Nephites were one people again. Limhi’s people, Alma’s people, and Mosiah’s people—even the people of Zarahemla, who were not descended from Nephi—were now all “numbered with the Nephites” (\nMosiah 25:13\n). Many of them also wanted to become members of the Lord’s Church, as Alma’s people had. So all those who “were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ” were baptized, “and they were called the people of God” (\nMosiah 25:23–24\n). After years of conflict and captivity, it seemed that the Nephites would finally enjoy a period of peace.\nBut before long, unbelievers began persecuting the Saints. What made this especially heartbreaking was that many of these unbelievers were the believers’ own children—the “rising generation” (\nMosiah 26:1\n), including the sons of Mosiah and one son of Alma. The account tells of a miraculous visit of an angel. But the true miracle of this story is not just about angels appearing to wayward sons. Conversion is a miracle that, in one way or another, needs to happen in all of us.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMosiah 26:1–6\nI can help others come unto Jesus Christ.\nConversion is personal—it cannot be passed like an inheritance to one’s children. As you read\nMosiah 26:1–6\n, ponder possible reasons “the rising generation” fell away, and notice the consequences of their unbelief. You might also think about people you wish you could bring to Christ. Throughout your study of\nMosiah 25–28\n, the Spirit may whisper things you can do to help them develop faith in Jesus Christ.\nPreserving the Voice of the Covenant People in the Rising Generation\nMosiah 26:6–39\nGod’s faithful servants seek to do His will.\nSometimes we might think that a Church leader like Alma always knows exactly what to do. In\nMosiah 26\nwe read of a problem in the Church that Alma had never dealt with. What did Alma do in this situation? (see\nMosiah 26:13–14, 33–34, 38–39\n). What does Alma’s experience suggest about how you might approach difficult problems in your family or your Church service?\nWhat did the Lord teach Alma in\nMosiah 26:15–32\n? Notice that some of the Lord’s answers were not in direct response to Alma’s question. What does this suggest about prayer and receiving personal revelation?\nPrinciples are eternal.\nAs you read, consider how the stories and teachings in the scriptures apply to your life. For example, you could ask yourself, “What experiences have I had that are like Alma’s?” or “What truths taught by Alma can help me?”\nMosiah 26:15–31\nGod freely forgives me as I repent and forgive others.\nRepentance and forgiveness are recurring themes in\nMosiah 26–27\n. Look for words and phrases that teach about repentance and forgiveness in\nMosiah 26:22–24, 29–31\n;\n27:23–37\n.\nSome people may wonder if God really does forgive them. How do you imagine Alma the Elder would counsel a member of the Church in Zarahemla who had that concern? What did Alma learn from the Lord in\nMosiah 26:15–31\nthat could help this Church member? (see also\nMoroni 6:8\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 19:16–18\n;\n58:42–43\n).\nMosiah 27:8–37\n;\n28:1–4\nThrough Jesus Christ, I can change for the better.\nIt was obvious that Alma the Younger needed a spiritual rebirth. He and the sons of Mosiah were “the very vilest of sinners” (\nMosiah 28:4\n). But soon after his conversion, Alma testified that conversion is essential—for everyone: “Marvel not,” he said, “that\nall\nmankind … must be born again” (\nMosiah 27:25\n; emphasis added).\nAs you read about Alma’s experience in\nMosiah 27:8–37\n, consider putting yourself in his story. Can you think of things about yourself that need to change? Who, like Alma’s father, might be praying for you “with much faith”? What experiences have helped “convince [you] of the power and authority of God”? (\nMosiah 27:14\n). What “great things” has the Lord done for you or your family that you should “remember”? (\nMosiah 27:16\n). What do you learn from Alma the Younger’s words and actions about what it means to be born again? What examples have you seen?\nTake a moment to record some of the ways the Savior is helping you change—or be born again—even if your experiences aren’t as dramatic or as sudden as Alma’s. Is there a hymn you could sing or listen to that expresses your feelings, like “\nI Stand All Amazed\n”? (\nHymns\n, no. 193). Who might benefit from hearing about your experiences?\nElder David A. Bednar compared being born again to the process of a cucumber becoming a pickle (see “\nYe Must Be Born Again\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2007, 19–22). What does this comparison teach you about conversion?\nSee also Gospel Library; “Alma Testifies He Has Been Born of God” (video), Gospel Library.\nAlma Testifies He Has Been Born of God | Mosiah 27; Alma 36\nMosiah 27:8–24\nGod hears my prayers and will answer them according to His will and timing.\nMaybe you’ve been in Alma the Elder’s situation with a family member who is making destructive choices. What do you find in\nMosiah 27:8–24\nthat gives you hope? How might these verses influence your prayers on behalf of others?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMosiah 26:30–31\nThe Lord wants me to forgive.\nTo help your children discover what the Lord taught Alma about forgiveness, you could invite them to read\nMosiah 26:29–31\nand count how many times the word “forgive” appears. What do these verses teach about forgiving others? (See also “\nHelp Me, Dear Father\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 99.)\nTo emphasize the Savior’s example of forgiveness, you could show a picture of Him on the cross and read together\nLuke 23:33–34\n.

Invite your children to find something in\nMosiah 26:22–23, 29–30\nthat might help that person.\nMosiah 27:8–37\nJesus Christ helps me become more like Him.\nThe conversion of Alma the Younger and the sons of Mosiah could show your children that, with the Savior’s power, anyone can change. You or your children could use the paintings in this outline, this week’s activity page, and a few key scriptures from\nMosiah 27:8–37\nto tell the story (see also “\nChapter 18: Alma the Younger Repents\n,” in\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 49–52). Give special emphasis to\nverse 24\n, to teach that Alma repented and Jesus Christ helped him change. Let your children act out the story if they’d like.\nAlma the Younger\nHis Father Rejoiced\n, by Walter Rane\nMosiah 27:8–24\nI can pray and fast for God to bless the people I love.\nRead together\nMosiah 27:8–24\n, and ask your children to identify what Alma and his people did to help Alma the Younger. Have you ever fasted and prayed for someone? Share your experience with your children, and let them share theirs.\nDo you or your children know someone who needs God’s help? Following Alma’s example, maybe you could pray together for that person and, if your children are able, fast for them too.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nIllustration of an angel appearing to Alma the Younger, by Kevin Keele\nOpen PDF"

Kapp\nJune 3–9: “They Were Steadfast and Immovable”\nMosiah 29\n–\nAlma 4\nSome might see King Mosiah’s proposal to replace kings with elected judges as merely wise political reform. But to the Nephites, especially those who lived under wicked King Noah, this change had spiritual significance too. They had seen how an unrighteous king had influenced his people, and they were “exceedingly anxious” to be free from such influence. This change would allow them to be responsible for their own righteousness and “answer for [their] own sins” (\nMosiah 29:38\n).\nOf course, the end of the reign of kings did not mean the end of problems in Nephite society. Cunning people like Nehor and Amlici promoted false ideas, nonbelievers persecuted the Saints, and many members of the Church became prideful and fell away. Yet “the humble followers of God” remained “steadfast and immovable” despite what happened around them (\nAlma 4:15\n;\n1:25\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMosiah 29:26–27\n;\nAlma 2:1–7\nI can be a positive influence in my community.\nJust five years into the reign of the judges, a crisis arose that would test Mosiah’s declaration that the voice of the people would usually choose what was right (see\nMosiah 29:26\n).

What else do you learn from this account about how the Lord wants you to be involved in your community? (see also\nMosiah 29:26–27\n).\nWhat are the important issues facing your community? Consider how you, like the Nephites, can make sure that your voice is included in “the voice of the people.” In what other ways can you, as a follower of Jesus Christ, influence your community for good?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nLove Your Enemies\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 26–29.\nAlma 1\nThe word of God can help me recognize false doctrine.\nAlthough Nehor eventually confessed that what he taught was false, his teachings continued to influence the Nephites for many years. Why do you think people liked what Nehor taught? In\nAlma 1:2–6\n, look for the lies in Nehor’s teachings—and the truths he used to hide those lies.\nGideon withstood Nehor “with the words of God” (\nAlma 1:7, 9\n).

Then you could talk with them about why Satan often combines truths with falsehoods. Help your children think of some examples. In\nverses 7–9\n, how did Gideon withstand Nehor’s lies? (See also “\nChapter 20: Alma and Nehor\n,”\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 54–55.)\nGideon, Alma, and Nehor\nAlma 1:19–25\nAs a member of the Church of Jesus Christ, I love and serve others.\nSome members of the Lord’s Church in Alma’s day were generous and giving, and other members were unkind and prideful. To help your children learn from these experiences, you could read together\nAlma 1:27, 30\nand make a list of the kinds of people members of the Lord’s Church helped. Who do we know who might “[stand] in need” (\nAlma 1:30\n) of our love and help? You could also sing together a song about love and service, such as “\nKindness Begins with Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 145), and help your children think of actions that could go with the song.\nWhat should we do when people are unkind to us? Consider reading with your children how followers of Christ were treated in\nAlma 1:19–20\n. Talk about how they reacted in\nverses 22 and 25\n. Maybe you could practice ways to respond when others are unkind.\nAlma 4:8–20\nMy testimony can strengthen others.\nOften the “pure testimony” (\nAlma 4:19\n) of a child can have a strong influence on others. To help your children discover this, you could read with them\nAlma 4:8–12, 15\n, helping them identify the problems that were happening in the Church. What could Alma do to solve these problems? Help them find out what Alma decided to do in\nAlma 4:16–20\n. Maybe you could share with each other how someone else’s testimony of Christ has strengthened you.\nIf your children need examples of what a testimony is, consider showing a video clip of a speaker in general conference bearing testimony. You could also use this week’s activity page or sing together a song like “\nTestimony\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 137). What do we learn about testimonies from these resources? Let your children practice sharing their testimonies.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nAlma and Amlici\n, by Scott M.

But he knew about a more miraculous “change of heart” (\nAlma 5:26\n)—one in which the Savior gives us a newness of spiritual life, like being “born again” (see\nAlma 5:14, 49\n). Alma could see that this change of heart was exactly what many of the Nephites needed. Some were rich and others poor, some prideful and others humble, some persecutors and others afflicted by persecution (see\nAlma 4:6–15\n). But all of them needed to come unto Jesus Christ to be healed—just as we all do. Whether we are seeking to overcome pride or to endure afflictions, Alma’s message is the same: “Come and fear not” (\nAlma 7:15\n).

What did you learn from these verses? What are some other ways He comes to your aid? When have you experienced His help?\nA hymn like “\nI Need Thee Every Hour\n” or “\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives\n” (\nHymns\n, nos. 98, 136) could deepen your appreciation for the Savior’s succor. What phrases in these hymns express your feelings toward Him?\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nAtonement of Jesus Christ\n,” Gospel Library; “\nHis Grace\n” (video collection), Gospel Library.\nTestify of Jesus Christ.\nConsider ways you can share your testimony of the Savior and His divinity, grace, and love. You can encourage the people you teach to testify of Him by asking questions that prompt them to share how they feel about Him.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nAlma 5:44–48\nI can gain my own testimony through the Holy Ghost.\nTo help your children learn to grow their own testimony, you could show them the picture below and ask them how we help baby animals grow. You could then relate this to taking care of our testimonies. What care do our testimonies need? How can we tell if they are growing?\nOur testimonies need daily care.\nHow did Alma gain his strong testimony of Jesus Christ? You could read\nAlma 5:44–46\nwith your children to find answers to this question. Perhaps your children could write down a plan to do one thing this week to strengthen their testimony.\nPillars and Rays\nAlma 7:10–13\nThe Savior took upon Himself my sins, pains, and afflictions.\nHow can you help your children understand\nAlma 7:10–13\nso they can know that Jesus Christ cares about them and can help them? Perhaps you could ask them to share an experience when they were sick or in pain or had another problem that made them sad. How did others help them feel better? Bear your testimony that the Savior has suffered those things too, and talk about a time when He comforted and helped you.\nAs you and your children read\nAlma 7:11–13\n, look for the things Jesus Christ suffered for us. Invite your children to use words and phrases they found to complete this sentence: “Jesus suffered\nso He can help me.” How does it help us to know that Jesus understands our struggles? How do we receive His help? Share your testimony of Jesus Christ.\nAlma 5:14\n;\n7:19–20\nFollowing Jesus Christ keeps me on the straight path back to Heavenly Father.\nLet your children look in a mirror as you read\nAlma 5:14\n(see also this week’s activity page). What does it mean to have the Savior’s image in our countenance?\nHow can you use Alma’s description of the path back to Heavenly Father to help your children learn to make good choices? You could read\nAlma 7:19–20\nto them and let them act out walking in “crooked paths” and walking in a straight path. Help them think of choices that help us stay on the path and other choices that take us off the path. You could also look at pictures of Jesus together and talk about things He did to show us the path back to Heavenly Father. A song like “\nI’m Trying to Be like Jesus\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 78–79) could provide some ideas.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nOur Advocate\n, by Jay Bryant Ward\nOpen PDF"

Alma 8–12,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nTeaching True Doctrine\n, by Michael T. Malm\nJune 17–23: Jesus Christ Will Come to Redeem His People\nAlma 8–12\nGod’s work will not fail. But our efforts to help with His work sometimes seem to fail—at least, we may not immediately see the outcomes we hope for. We might feel a little like Alma when he preached the gospel in Ammonihah—rejected, spit on, and cast out. Yet when an angel instructed him to go back and try again, Alma courageously “returned speedily” (\nAlma 8:18\n), and God prepared the way before him. Not only did He provide Alma with food to eat and a place to stay, but He also prepared Amulek, who became a fellow laborer, a fierce defender of the gospel, and a faithful friend. When we face setbacks and disappointments as we serve in the Lord’s kingdom, we can remember how God supported and led Alma, and we can trust that God will support and lead us too, even in difficult circumstances.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 8\nMy efforts to share the gospel of Jesus Christ require patience.\nHave you ever tried to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with someone, but your invitation was rejected? Alma experienced that too. What do you learn from him in\nAlma 8:13–16\nabout sharing the gospel despite challenges and opposition? Continue reading in\nverses 17–32\n, and look for phrases that inspire you to keep sharing the gospel, even when you don’t seem to be succeeding.\nProphets and apostles are special witnesses of Christ, so they have a lot of inspired counsel to share about testifying of Him. Look at what Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf said in “\nBut What If It’s Hard?\n” (a section in “\nMissionary Work: Sharing What Is in Your Heart\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 18) or what Elder Gary E. Stevenson shared in “\nLove, Share, Invite\n” (\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 84–87). What do you find there that could help someone who’s starting to feel discouraged about sharing the gospel?\nHow would you summarize everything you’ve studied here into one or two encouraging statements about sharing the gospel? Consider making a poster or meme that can inspire you (and others) to keep trying.\nSee also “\nHelp Me Teach with Inspiration\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 281; “Alma Is Commanded by an Angel to Return to Ammonihah” (video), Gospel Library; Gospel Topics, “\nMissionary Work\n,” Gospel Library.\nAlma Is Commanded by an Angel to Return to Ammonihah | Alma 8\nAlma 9:14–23\nGod’s blessings come with great responsibility.\nWhen reading about the way the Nephites in Ammonihah treated the Lord’s servants, it is easy to forget that they once lived the gospel and were a “highly favored people of the Lord” (\nAlma 9:20\n). As you read about the great blessings God gave the people of Nephi (see especially\nAlma 9:14–23\n), ponder the great blessings He has given you. What responsibilities come with these blessings? What are you doing to stay true to these responsibilities?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 50:24\n;\n82:3\n;\n93:39\n.\nGod’s Intent Is to Bring You Home\nAlma 11–12\nGod’s plan is a plan of redemption.\nIn\nAlma 11–12\n, Alma and Amulek referred to God’s plan as the plan of redemption. As you read these chapters, ponder why the word\nredemption\nis used to describe God’s plan. Consider writing a short summary of what Alma and Amulek taught about the following aspects of the plan:\nThe Fall\nThe Redeemer\nRepentance\nDeath\nResurrection\nJudgment\nNotice the effect Amulek’s words had on the people (see\nAlma 11:46\n). How does knowing about God’s plan affect you?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nThe Great Plan\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 93–96; “Amulek Testifies of Jesus Christ” (video), Gospel Library.\nAmulek Testifies of Jesus Christ | Alma 10–11\nAlma 12:8–18\nIf I do not harden my heart, I can receive more of the word of God.\nSome people may wonder why Heavenly Father doesn’t make everything known to us. In\nAlma 12:9–14\n, Alma explained one possible reason. These questions could help you ponder what he taught:\nWhat does it mean to harden your heart? What are the results of having a hard heart? (see also\nAlma 8:9–11\n;\n9:5, 30–31\n; and\n10:6, 25\n).\nWhat can you do to turn your heart toward God? (see\nJeremiah 24:7\n;\nAlma 16:16\n;\nHelaman 3:35\n).\nWhat can you do to ensure that God’s word is “found in [you]”? (\nAlma 12:13\n). When you have God’s word in you, what effect does it have on your “words,” “works,” and “thoughts”? (\nAlma 12:14\n).\nWhat does Amulek’s experience teach you about the blessings of having a soft heart? (see\nAlma 10:1–11\n).\nSee also “Alma Warns Zeezrom” (video), Gospel Library.\nAlma Warns Zeezrom | Alma 12–13\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nAlma 8–10\nI can share the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nThis week’s activity page could help you summarize the events in\nAlma 8–10\nfor your children. You might want to help them find principles that made Alma and Amulek good missionaries. For example, they didn’t give up (see\nAlma 8:8–13\n), they testified of Christ (see\nAlma 9:26–27\n), and they worked together (see\nAlma 10:12\n).\nA song about missionary work, such as “\nI Want to Be a Missionary Now\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 168) could give your children ideas about ways to share the gospel with their friends. Invite them to list ideas they find and people they could share the gospel with. You might even let them role-play what they might say or do.\nEncourage participation.\nAs you prepare to teach, rather than planning things to say, ask yourself, “What will the\nchildren do\nto learn?” Children will learn better and remember longer when they actively participate.\nAlma, Amulek, and Zeezrom\nAlma 11–12\nGod’s plan is a plan of redemption.\nPerhaps your children could draw a picture representing principles of the plan of redemption, like the Fall of Adam and Eve, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, repentance, death, resurrection, and judgment. Then you could help them match their pictures to verses in\nAlma 11–12\nthat teach about these principles.\nAlma 8:18–22\nI can be a good friend.\nYou could invite one child to pretend to be Amulek and another to pretend to be Alma as you tell the story in\nAlma 8:18–22\n. How was Amulek a good friend to Alma? Then your children could share how someone has been a friend to them and how that experience made them feel.\nMaybe you could make a friendship puzzle: find or draw a picture representing friendship and cut it into puzzle pieces. On the back of each piece, write something we can do to be a good friend, including things Alma and Amulek did. Your children could take turns selecting a piece and adding it to the puzzle as you read what is written on the back. Who needs our friendship?\nWe can be good friends to others.\nAlma 11:43–44\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I will be resurrected.\nConsider an object lesson like this one to teach about the Resurrection: your hand could represent your spirit, and a glove could represent your body. Take your hand out of the glove to show that our spirits and bodies will be separated at death. Then place your hand back in the glove to show that our spirits and bodies will be joined together again at the Resurrection. Let your children take turns putting the glove on and taking it off as you read\nAlma 11:43\nto them. Display a picture of the resurrected Savior (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nno. 59\n), and testify that Jesus Christ made it possible for everyone to be resurrected.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nIllustration of Alma eating with Amulek, by Dan Burr\nOpen PDF"

Alma 13–16,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nIllustration of Alma and Amulek being delivered from prison, by Andrew Bosley\nJune 24–30: “Enter into the Rest of the Lord”\nAlma 13–16\nIn many ways, life in Ammonihah had been good for both Amulek and Zeezrom. Amulek was “a man of no small reputation,” with “many kindreds and friends” and “much riches” (\nAlma 10:4\n). Zeezrom was an expert lawyer who enjoyed “much business” (\nAlma 10:31\n). Then Alma arrived with an invitation to repent and “enter into the rest of the Lord” (\nAlma 13:16\n). For Amulek, Zeezrom, and others, accepting this invitation required sacrifice and even led to almost unbearable adversity.\nBut of course the story doesn’t end there. In\nAlma 13–16\n, we learn what ultimately happens to people who believe “in the power of Christ unto salvation” (\nAlma 15:6\n). Sometimes there’s deliverance, sometimes healing—and sometimes things don’t get any easier in life. But always, “the Lord receiveth [His people] up unto himself, in glory” (\nAlma 14:11\n). Always, the Lord grants “power, according to [our] faith … in Christ” (\nAlma 14:28\n). And always, that faith gives us “hope that [we] shall receive eternal life” (\nAlma 13:29\n). As you read these chapters, you can take comfort in these promises, and you may come to understand better what Alma meant when he spoke of entering into “the rest of the Lord” (\nAlma 13:16\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 13:1–19\nPriesthood ordinances point me to Jesus Christ for redemption.\nAlma’s words in\nAlma 13\nreveal powerful truths about God’s priesthood power and its purpose—to prepare us to enter into “the rest of the Lord,” or eternal life (\nAlma 13:16\n). Perhaps you could write down at least one truth for each verse in\nAlma 13:1–19\n. Here are some ideas to get you started:\nVerse 1\n.\nThe priesthood is also called “the order of [God’s] Son” (see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 107:1–4\n).\nVerse 2\n.\nGod ordains priests to help people look to His Son for redemption.\nWhat else do you find? How do you feel about the priesthood as you ponder these truths?\nHave you ever thought about priesthood ordinances as a gift from God to help you “look forward to his Son for redemption”? (\nverse 2\n; see also\nverse 16\n). Maybe you could make a list of ordinances you’ve received, such as baptism, confirmation, the sacrament, setting apart for a calling, a blessing of comfort or healing, a patriarchal blessing, and temple ordinances. Ponder your experiences with ordinances like these. Consider the symbolism involved and the Spirit you felt. How does each of these ordinances point you to Jesus Christ for redemption?\nSome people mistakenly believe that ordinances—and the priesthood authority to perform them—aren’t necessary. How would you respond to this idea? Here are two general conference messages that could inform your thinking; pick one, and write down any answers that come to you: Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; Dale G. Renlund, “\nThe Priesthood and the Savior’s Atoning Power\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 64–67.\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:19–22\n; Gospel Topics, “\nCovenant\n,” Gospel Library.\nPriesthood ordinances help us look to Jesus Christ for redemption.\nAlma 13\nThe Lord invites me to enter into His rest.\nThe invitation to “enter into the rest of the Lord” (\nAlma 13:16\n) is repeated often in\nAlma 13\n. Maybe you could look for every verse where the word “rest” appears and ponder what each verse teaches you about what “the rest of the Lord” might mean. How is it different from physical rest? How do we find it?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nOvercome the World and Find Rest\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2022, 95–98; “\nCome unto Jesus\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 117.\nAlma 14\nIn times of suffering, we must trust the Lord.\nYou might wonder, as many do, why terrible things happen to people who are trying to live righteously. You may not find all the answers to this difficult question in\nAlma 14\n, but there is much to learn from the way Alma and Amulek responded to tragedy. What do their words and actions teach you about why the Lord sometimes allows righteous people to suffer? What advice might Alma and Amulek give to us when we are experiencing difficult trials?\nSee also\nRomans 8:35–39\n;\n1 Peter 4:12–14\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 122:5–9\n; Dale G. Renlund, “\nInfuriating Unfairness\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 41–45.\nBe ready always.\nTeaching moments pass quickly, so take advantage of them when they come up. A tragedy in the world, for example, may be a chance to share principles from\nAlma 14\nabout why the Lord sometimes allows the innocent to suffer.\nAll Things for Our Good\nAlma 15:16, 18\nDiscipleship requires sacrifice.\nIt might be interesting to make a list of the things Amulek gave up to embrace the gospel (see\nAlma 10:4–5\n;\n15:16\n) and compare it to a list of what he gained (see\nAlma 15:18\n;\n16:13–15\n;\n34:8\n). What are you willing to sacrifice to become a more faithful disciple of Jesus Christ?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nAlma 13:1–2, 16\nPriesthood power helps me come closer to Christ.\nOne way to help your children see how priesthood power points us to Christ is to show them pictures of ways priesthood power is used (see\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 103–110\n). Your children could help you think of ways Jesus used His power (see, for example,\nMatthew 26:26–28\n;\nMark 5:22–24, 35–43\n;\nGospel Art Book\n,\nnos. 38–41\n). Then you could read\nAlma 13:2\ntogether and talk about how priesthood power helps us “look forward to [God’s] Son” and become more like Him.\nWhy did God give us priesthood ordinances? Help your children find an answer in\nAlma 13:16\n. If they need help knowing what an ordinance is, there are lists in the\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n18.1\nand\n18.2\n. Maybe you and your children could talk about your experiences receiving these ordinances. How do they help us “look forward to [Jesus Christ] for a remission of [our] sins”? A song like “\nWhen I Am Baptized\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 103) can help your children think of other reasons to be thankful for priesthood ordinances.\nAlma 13:10–12\nJesus Christ can make me clean.\nAfter reading these verses together, consider ways to help your children visualize what they teach. Maybe you could wash something together. How do we feel when we are dirty? How do we feel when we become clean again? How are these feelings similar to what we feel when we sin and then repent and become clean through the Savior’s Atonement?\nAlma 14:18–29\nHeavenly Father strengthens me as I have faith in Jesus Christ.\nThis week’s activity page could help you—or your children—tell the story in\nAlma 14:18–29\n(see also “\nChapter 22: Alma’s Mission to Ammonihah\n,”\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 58–63). Emphasize that Alma and Amulek were given strength because of their “faith which [was] in Christ” (\nAlma 14:26\n). You could also talk about a time when God gave you strength “according to [your] faith.” How can we be faithful like Alma and Amulek?\nAlma and Amulek in Prison\nAlma 15:3–12\nJesus Christ can change hearts.\nZeezrom’s change of heart through Jesus Christ is inspiring. Consider reviewing with your children what they learned last week about Zeezrom. Then you could read together\nAlma 15:3–12\nto discover how he changed. What do we learn from Zeezrom’s experience about the Lord’s power? (see “Zeezrom Is Healed and Baptized” [video], Gospel Library).\nZeezrom Is Healed and Baptized | Alma 15\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nAlma and Amulek in Prison\n, by Gary L.

      "plain_text": "“July 1–7: ‘I Will Make an Instrument of Thee.’ Alma 17–22,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Book of Mormon 2024\n(2023)\n“July 1–7. Alma 17–22,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nAmmon and King Lamoni\n, by Scott M. Snow\nJuly 1–7: “I Will Make an Instrument of Thee”\nAlma 17–22\nThink of all the reasons people might give for not sharing the gospel: “I don’t know enough” or “I’m not sure they would be interested” or maybe “I’m afraid I’ll be rejected.” Maybe you’ve found yourself thinking similar things at times. The Nephites had an additional reason for not sharing the gospel with the Lamanites: they were described as “a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites” (\nAlma 17:14\n; see also\nAlma 26:23–25\n). But the sons of Mosiah had an even stronger reason why they felt they\nmust\nshare the gospel with the Lamanites: “They were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish” (\nMosiah 28:3\n). This love that inspired Ammon and his brothers can also inspire you to share the gospel with your family, friends, and acquaintances—even those who may not seem likely to accept it.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 17:1–4\nSimple, consistent acts of devotion to Christ help me receive His power.\nWhat do you learn from\nAlma 17:1–4\nabout how to keep your testimony of and commitment to Jesus Christ strong? What did the sons of Mosiah do, and how did the Lord bless them?\nAs you read about the experiences of the sons of Mosiah in\nAlma 17–22\n, note how their spiritual preparation affected their service among the Lamanites (for example, see\nAlma 18:10–18, 34–36\n;\n20:2–5\n;\n22:12–16\n). What do you feel inspired to do to follow their example?\nAlma 17:6–12\n;\n19:16–36\nI can be an instrument in God’s hands.\nThe accounts of conversion we read about in the scriptures are often dramatic, but at their core we usually find individuals who had the courage to speak up and share their faith in Jesus Christ. Think about this as you read about Abish and the sons of Mosiah this week.\nWhat do you think it means to be an instrument in God’s hands? It might help to think of instruments or tools that you might use in your daily life. In\nAlma 17:6–12\n, look for what the sons of Mosiah did so they could be instruments in God’s hands. How can you become a more effective instrument in helping others come unto Christ?\nWhat impresses you about Abish in\nAlma 19:16–36\n? What do you learn from her about helping others build faith in Christ? For example, what do you feel would help people you love “believe in the power of God”? (\nAlma 19:17\n).\nYou might also compare Abish’s experience with the principles Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught in “\nMissionary Work: Sharing What Is in Your Heart\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 15–18). How did Abish exemplify Elder Uchtdorf’s “Five Simple Suggestions”? Try writing down some things you might say about Jesus Christ. For example, “For me, Jesus Christ …” or “The Savior helps me …”\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nMinistering as the Savior Does\n,” Gospel Library; “\nBrightly Beams Our Father’s Mercy\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 335; “Come and See,” “Come and Help,” “Come and Belong” (videos), Gospel Library.\nCome and See\nCome and Help\nCome and Belong\nUse object lessons.\nAny time people can see or touch something related to what they’re learning, they’re likely to remember it longer. If you’re teaching about\nAlma 17:11\n, for example, consider showing musical instruments or writing instruments to help inspire a discussion about being an instrument in God’s hands.\nAlma 17–19\nWhen we show love for others, we can help them receive the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nLook for verses in\nAlma 17–19\nthat show how Ammon’s love for the Lamanites inspired his efforts to share the gospel of Jesus Christ. What other truths about sharing the gospel do you learn from his example?\nSee also “Ammon Serves and Teaches King Lamoni” (video), Gospel Library.\nAmmon Serves and Teaches King Lamoni | Alma 17–19\nMinerva Teichert (1888–1976),\nAmmon Saves the King’s Flocks\n, 1949–1951, oil on masonite, 35 15/16 × 48 inches. Brigham Young University Museum of Art, 1969.\nAlma 19:36\nThe Lord will help me repent.\nAfter recounting the conversion of Lamoni and his people, Mormon summarized the account with an observation about Jesus Christ. What does\nAlma 19:36\nteach you about the Lord’s character? What else does the account in\nAlma 19:16–36\nteach you about Him? When have you felt the Lord’s arm extended toward you?\nAlma 20:23\n;\n22:15–18\nKnowing God is worth any sacrifice.\nCompare what Lamoni’s father was willing to give up to save his life (see\nAlma 20:23\n) with what he was later willing to give up to receive the joy of the gospel and to know God (see\nAlma 22:15, 18\n). Ponder what you are willing to sacrifice in order to know God more fully.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nAlma 17:2–3\nMy testimony of Jesus Christ grows when I read the scriptures, pray, and fast.\nHow can the examples of Mosiah’s sons help your children build their testimonies of Jesus Christ? You could help your children find what the sons of Mosiah did to build their spiritual strength in\nAlma 17:2–3\n. Then they could draw pictures or find objects that represent these things. Help them plan what they will do to strengthen their testimonies of the Savior.\nAlma 17–19\nI can share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others.\nTo learn about being an instrument in God’s hands, as the sons of Mosiah were, you and your children could look at an instrument or tool and talk about what it’s used for. Then you could read\nAlma 17:11\nand talk about what it means to be Heavenly Father’s instruments to help people learn about Jesus Christ.\nThis week’s activity page has pictures representing truths Ammon taught King Lamoni. You could help your children find these truths in\nAlma 18:24–40\n. Your children could pretend to be missionaries and share what they know about these truths.\nAfter you read about Abish with your children (see\nAlma 19:16–20, 28–29\n), they could pretend to be like Abish by running in place, knocking on doors, and telling about what happened in\nAlma 19:1–17\n. How can we be like Abish and share what we know about Jesus Christ and His gospel? Your children could draw pictures of themselves sharing the gospel with someone or sing together a song about sharing the gospel, such as “\nCalled to Serve\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 174–75).\nAbish\nAlma 17:21–25\n;\n20:8–27\n;\n22:1–3\nI can help others come unto Christ by showing my love for them.\nAt first, both King Lamoni and his father had hard hearts toward the gospel. Later, their hearts were softened, and they believed in Jesus Christ. How did this happen? Help your children discover answers to this question as you review with them Ammon’s experiences. They could act out “\nChapter 23: Ammon: A Great Servant\n” and “\nChapter 24: Ammon Meets King Lamoni’s Father\n” (\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 64–68, 69–70). Or perhaps your children would like to draw pictures of different parts of the story and use the pictures to tell the stories. What did Ammon do to help Lamoni and his father open their hearts to the gospel of Jesus Christ? (see\nAlma 17:21–25\n;\n20:8–27\n;\n22:1–3\n).\nAmmon\nThe King of All the Lamanites\nPerhaps you and your children could think of someone who needs to know about Jesus Christ. Help them think of ways they can be good examples and show love to that person, like Ammon did for Lamoni and his father.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nThe voices in this lesson were generated using AI.\nAn illustration of Abish, by Dilleen Marsh\nOpen PDF"

Alma 23–29,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nAnti-Nephi-Lehies Bury Their Weapons of War\n, by Jody Livingston\nJuly 8–14: They “Never Did Fall Away”\nAlma 23–29\nDo you sometimes wonder whether people can really change? Maybe you worry about whether you can overcome poor choices you’ve made or bad habits you’ve developed, or you may have similar worries about loved ones. If so, the story of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies can help you. These people were the sworn enemies of the Nephites. When the sons of Mosiah decided to preach the gospel to them, the Nephites “laughed [them] to scorn.” Killing the Lamanites seemed like a more plausible solution than converting them. (See\nAlma 26:23–25\n.)\nBut the Lamanites did change—through the converting power of Jesus Christ. They were once known as “a hardened and a ferocious people” (\nAlma 17:14\n), but they became “distinguished for their zeal towards God” (\nAlma 27:27\n). In fact, they “never did fall away” (\nAlma 23:6\n).\nMaybe you have some thoughts or actions to change or “weapons of … rebellion” to lay down (\nAlma 23:7\n). Or maybe you just need to be a little more zealous toward God. No matter what changes you need,\nAlma 23–29\ncan give you hope that through the atoning power of Jesus Christ, long-lasting change is possible.\nThe Lord Delivers the People of Ammon\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 23–25\n;\n27\nMy conversion to Jesus Christ and His gospel will change my life.\nThe Lamanites seemed to be unlikely candidates for conversion, yet many of them experienced miraculous changes because of Jesus Christ. These converted Lamanites called themselves Anti-Nephi-Lehies.\nReading\nAlma 23–25\n;\n27\nmight prompt you to ponder your own conversion. Look for how the Anti-Nephi-Lehies changed—how they were converted “unto the Lord” (\nAlma 23:6\n). The following verses can get you started:\nAlma 23:6–7\nAlma 23:17–18\nAlma 24:15–21\nAlma 25:13–16\nAlma 27:26–30\nIn what ways have Jesus Christ and His gospel changed you? When have you felt close to Him? How can you tell if you are becoming converted to Jesus Christ? What is the Spirit prompting you to do next?\nSee also David A. Bednar, “\nConverted unto the Lord,\n”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2012, 106–9; Dale G. Renlund, “\nUnwavering Commitment to Jesus Christ\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 22–25.\nAlma 24:7–19\n;\n26:17–22\nBecause God is merciful, He forgives me as I repent.\nThe change that the Anti-Nephi-Lehies experienced was more than just a change in behavior—it was a change of heart born of faith in Jesus Christ and sincere repentance. Perhaps you could find a truth about repentance in each verse in\nAlma 24:7–19\n. What do these verses teach about God’s mercy toward those who repent? What additional truths do you learn from\nAlma 26:17–22\n?\nPonder how God has shown His mercy in your life. How can you express your gratitude to Him?\nAlma 26\n;\n29\nSharing the gospel brings me joy.\nThe word\njoy\nappears 24 times in\nAlma 23–29\n, making these chapters a good place to learn how to receive joy in living—and sharing—the Savior’s gospel. Consider studying\nAlma 26:12–22, 35–37\n; and\n29:1–17\n, looking for reasons why Ammon, the sons of Mosiah, and Alma rejoiced. What do you learn from these passages that can lead to more joy in your life?\nElder Marcus B. Nash taught: “Sharing the gospel kindles joy and hope in the souls of both giver and receiver. … Sharing the gospel is joy upon joy, hope upon hope” (“\nHold Up Your Light\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 71). What experiences have you had sharing the gospel with others? What challenges do you face when seeking to share the gospel? How can Heavenly Father help you overcome these challenges?\nFor prophetic instruction on\nhow\nto share the gospel—and find joy in doing it—consider studying President Dallin H. Oak’s message “\nSharing the Restored Gospel\n,” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 57–60). What suggestions do you find in his message?\nSee also “The Bush Family Story,” “Sharing Your Beliefs,” “Sharing the Gospel” (videos), Gospel Library.\nConsider making a list of things you would share with a friend about the Book of Mormon. Try sharing the Book of Mormon using the\nBook of Mormon app\n.\nThe Bush Family Story\nSharing Your Beliefs\nSharing the Gospel\nLook for patterns and themes.\nWhen studying the scriptures, we can find precious truths by looking for repeated words, phrases, or ideas. Those repeated ideas can be cross-referenced or linked in your scriptures to make them easier to see.\nAlma 26:5–7\nI can find shelter in Jesus Christ and His gospel.\nAt harvest time, grain is often gathered into bundles called\nsheaves\nand placed in storehouses, sometimes called\ngarners\n. In\nAlma 26:5–7\nponder what the sheaves, garners, and storm might represent in your life. How do you find shelter in Jesus Christ?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Temple and Your Spiritual Foundation\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 93–96; David A. Bednar, “\nHonorably Hold a Name and a Standing\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2009, 97–100; “\nJesus, Lover of My Soul\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 102.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nAlma 24:6–24\nThe Lord blesses me as I strive to keep my promises to Him.\nPerhaps your children would enjoy burying their “weapons” like the Anti-Nephi-Lehies. You could read a few verses from\nAlma 24:6–24\nto teach the children about the promises the Anti-Nephi-Lehies made to follow the Savior. They could then think of something they will change to follow Him, write it on this week’s activity page, and pretend to dig a hole and bury their weapon.\nYour children could read\nAlma 24:15–19\n, looking for what the Anti-Nephi-Lehies did “as a testimony to God.” Then you could talk with them about how our covenants can be “a testimony to God” (\nverse 18\n).

To do this, you might label two bowls “before” and “after.” Then your children could read\nAlma 17:14–15\nand\n27:27–30\n, write down what the Lamanites were like before and after repenting, and put them in the correct bowl.

Alma 30–31,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nAll Things Denote There Is a God (Alma and Korihor)\n, by Walter Rane\nJuly 15–21: “The Virtue of the Word of God”\nAlma 30–31\nThe accounts in\nAlma 30–31\nclearly demonstrate the power of words—for evil and for good. The “flattering” and “great swelling words” of a false teacher named Korihor threatened to bring “many souls down to destruction” (\nAlma 30:31, 47\n). Similarly, the teachings of a Nephite dissenter named Zoram led a whole group of people to fall “into great errors” and “pervert the ways of the Lord” (\nAlma 31:9, 11\n).\nIn contrast, Alma had unwavering faith that the word of God would have a “more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else” (\nAlma 31:5\n). Alma’s words expressed eternal truth and drew upon the powers of Jesus Christ to silence Korihor (see\nAlma 30:39–50\n), and they invited His blessing on those who went with him to bring the Zoramites back to the truth (see\nAlma 31:31–38\n). These are valuable examples for followers of Christ today when false messages are common. We can find truth by trusting, as Alma did, “the virtue of the word of God” (\nAlma 31:5\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 30:6–31\nThe adversary tries to deceive me with false teachings.\nIn\nAlma 30\n, Korihor is called “Anti-Christ” (\nverse 6\n). An anti-Christ is anyone or anything that is openly or secretly in opposition to Jesus Christ and His gospel. Which verses in\nAlma 30:6–31\nshow that Korihor fits this description? Studying Korihor’s false teachings can help you recognize and reject similar teachings. The following activities may help in your study:\nWhat object lessons can you think of to better understand the difference between the Savior’s teachings and Satan’s false imitations? Some examples are a lure used for fishing, fake money, and false advertising. How can you tell if something is fake? How can you recognize truth?\nConsider making a list of the false doctrines Korihor taught in\nAlma 30:6–31\n. Which of his teachings might be enticing today? (see\nAlma 30:12–18, 23–28\n). What harm can result from accepting such ideas? What false messages is the adversary using to try to deceive you today?\nWhat did Alma do to counter Korihor’s teachings with truth? (see\nAlma 30:31–54\n). How can you use these same principles in your life?\nLike Alma, modern prophets and apostles help us know the difference between truth and Satan’s lies. What counsel do you find in these messages: Gary E. Stevenson, “\nDeceive Me Not\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 93–96); Dallin H. Oaks, “\nBe Not Deceived\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2004, 43–46).\nSee also Topics and Questions, “\nSeeking Answers to Your Questions\n,” Gospel Library; “\nOh Say, What Is Truth?\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 272.\nKorihor Confronts Alma\n, by Robert T. Barrett\nAlma 30:39–46\nAll things testify of God.\nMany people today believe that there is no God. What do you find in\nAlma 30:39–46\nthat helps you know that God is real? What prevents us from knowing Him? What other testimonies has God given you that He lives?\nAlma 30:56–60\nThe adversary does not support his followers.\nWhat do you learn from\nAlma 30:56–60\nabout how the devil treats his followers? What can you do to protect your home against his influence?\nSee also\nAlma 36:3\n.\nAlma 31\nGod’s word has the power to lead people to righteousness.\nThe problem of the Zoramites separating from the Nephites may have seemed to some like it needed a political or military solution (see\nAlma 31:1–4\n). But Alma had learned to trust “the virtue of the word of God” (\nAlma 31:5\n). What do you learn from\nAlma 31:5\nabout the power of God’s word? (see also\nHebrews 4:12\n;\n1 Nephi 15:23–24\n;\n2 Nephi 31:20\n;\nJacob 2:8\n;\nHelaman 3:29–30\n).\nAs you study\nAlma 31\n, what other gospel truths can you find that apply to your life experiences? For example:\nHow have you seen the word of God lead people to do good things? (see\nverse 5\n).\nCompare Alma’s attitudes, feelings, and actions regarding others (see\nverses 34–35\n) with those of the Zoramites (see\nverses 17–28\n). How can you be more like Alma?\nWhat do you find in\nAlma 31:30–38\nthat can help people who sorrow for the sins of others?\nSwallowed Up in the Joy of Christ\nAlma 31:5–6\nBecause of Jesus Christ, anyone can change.\nNotice the group of people Alma took with him to teach the gospel to the Zoramites (see\nAlma 31:6\n). What do you learn about the lives of these people in\nMosiah 27:8–37\n;\n28:4\n;\nAlma 10:1–6\n;\n11:21–25\n;\n15:3–12\n. What message might there be for you in their experiences?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nAlma 30\nThe Book of Mormon warns me against false teachings.\nConsider displaying some items (such as money or food) and toy imitations of these items. This could lead to a discussion about how to know the difference between things that are real and things that are false. Then you could help your children identify from\nAlma 30:12–18\nthe lies or false teachings that Korihor taught about God. In\nAlma 30:32–35\n, how did Alma respond to those lies? What do we learn from his example?\nAlma and Korihor\nAlma 30:44\nAll things testify of God.\nAlma talked about how things in the sky and on the earth testify that God lives. If possible, take a walk outside with your children or stand at a window as you read\nAlma 30:44\n. Ask them to point out things they see that help them know that God is real and that He loves them. They could also draw pictures of things they discover (see\nthis week’s activity page\n).\nWhile you and your children sing “\nMy Heavenly Father Loves Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 228–29), pass around a ball or other object. Periodically stop the music and ask the child holding the object to share one thing Heavenly Father created that he or she is grateful for.\nChildren learn through visuals.\nVisuals will help your children understand better and remember longer what they have been taught. Most of the activities for children in this outline suggest visuals to use. Consider showing the same visuals again in the future to help your children remember what they learned.\nAlma 31:5\nThe word of God is powerful.\nHow can you help your children understand that the word of God is more powerful than “anything else”? (\nAlma 31:5\n). Consider asking them to think of something or someone powerful, or show pictures of a few powerful things. What makes them powerful? Read\nAlma 31:5\ntogether, and ask your children what they think this verse means. Share an experience when the word of God had a powerful influence on you.\nWords Matter\nAlma 31:8–35\nHeavenly Father hears my prayers.\nBriefly summarize the story of Alma and the Zoramites, using verses from\nAlma 31:8–35\n(see also “\nChapter 28: The Zoramites and the Rameumptom\n,”\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 78–80). Help your children identify things the Zoramites said in their prayer (see\nAlma 31:15–18\n) as they help you build a Rameumptom tower with blocks or rocks.

Alma 32–35,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nJuly 22–28: “Plant This Word in Your Hearts”\nAlma 32–35\nFor the Zoramites, prayer consisted of standing where all could see and repeating empty, self-satisfied words. The Zoramites lacked faith in Jesus Christ—even denied His existence—and persecuted the poor (see\nAlma 31:9–25\n). By contrast, Alma and Amulek taught that prayer has more to do with what happens in our hearts than on a public platform. And if we do not show compassion toward people in need, our prayer is “vain, and availeth … nothing” (\nAlma 34:28\n). Most important, we pray because we have faith in Jesus Christ, who offers redemption through His “infinite and eternal sacrifice” (\nAlma 34:10\n). Such faith, Alma explained, starts with humility and a “desire to believe” (\nAlma 32:27\n). Over time, with constant nourishment, the word of God takes root in our hearts until it becomes “a tree springing up unto everlasting life” (\nAlma 32:41\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 32:17–43\nI exercise faith in Jesus Christ by planting and nourishing His word in my heart.\nAs you read\nAlma 32:17–43\n, note words and phrases that help you understand how to exercise faith in Jesus Christ. What do you learn about what faith is and what it is not?\nAnother way to study\nAlma 32\nis to draw pictures representing different phases of a seed’s growth. Then label each picture with words from\nAlma 32:28–43\nthat help you understand how to plant and nourish the word of God in your heart.\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nChrist Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 101–4.\nAlma 32:26–43\nI can know for myself.\nTo the Zoramites who weren’t yet sure about Alma’s testimony of Christ, Alma suggested “an experiment” (see\nAlma 32:27\n). Experiments require desire, curiosity, action, and at least a little faith—and they can lead to wonderful discoveries! Think about experiments you’ve seen or participated in. According to\nAlma 32:26–36\n, what kind of experiment can lead to faith in Jesus Christ?\nHow have you have “experimented” upon the word of God and come to know that “the word is good”? (\nAlma 32:28\n).\nPillars and Rays\nAlma 33:2–11\n;\n34:17–29\nI can worship God in prayer, anytime and anywhere.\nAlma and Amulek’s counsel about worship and prayer was meant to correct specific misunderstandings the Zoramites had. Consider listing them (see\nAlma 31:13–23\n). Next to that list, you could make a list of truths about prayer in\nAlma 33:2–11\nand\n34:17–29\n. How will the things that you learn from these verses affect the way you pray and worship?\nYou can also find insights from a hymn about prayer, such as “\nSweet Hour of Prayer\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 142).\nAlma 34:9–16\nI need Jesus Christ and His Atonement.\nNotice how many times Amulek used the words\ninfinite\nand\neternal\nto describe the Savior’s atoning sacrifice in\nAlma 34:9–14\n. Why is it important to know that the Savior’s Atonement is infinite and eternal? Look for words and phrases in these verses that also describe the Savior’s Atonement:\nHebrews 10:10\n;\n2 Nephi 9:21\n;\nMosiah 3:13\n.\nEven when we know Jesus’s power to save is infinite and eternal, we might sometimes doubt that it applies to us—or to someone who has sinned against us. Elder David A. Bednar once spoke of people who “seem to have faith in the Savior, but they do not believe His promised blessings are available to them” (“\nIf Ye Had Known Me\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 104). What might keep us from fully receiving the Savior’s power?

He felt something similar after returning from his mission to the Zoramites—he observed that the hearts of many of the Nephites “began to wax hard, and that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word,” and this made his heart “exceedingly sorrowful” (\nAlma 35:15\n). What did Alma do about what he saw and felt? He didn’t simply become discouraged or cynical about the state of the world. Instead, “he caused that his sons should be gathered together” and taught them “things pertaining unto righteousness” (\nAlma 35:16\n). He taught them that “there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. … Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness” (\nAlma 38:9\n).\nIdeas for Teaching at Home and at Church\nAlma 36\n;\n38:5–6\nI can be born of God.\nFew of us will have experiences as dramatic as Alma’s conversion.

Part of what makes\nAlma 39–42\nso valuable is that it reveals how Alma—a disciple of Christ who once had his own grievous sins to repent of—handled such a situation. Alma’s son Corianton had committed sexual sin, and Alma, as he had learned to do in his ministry, trusted the power of true doctrine to give his son an eternal perspective and encourage repentance (see\nAlma 4:19\n;\n31:5\n). In these chapters, we observe Alma’s boldness in condemning sin and his tenderness and love for Corianton. And ultimately, we sense Alma’s confidence that the Savior “shall come to take away the sins of the world [and] declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people” (\nAlma 39:15\n). The fact that Corianton repented and eventually returned to the work of the ministry (see\nAlma 49:30\n) can give us hope for forgiveness and redemption when we are troubled about our own sins or the sins of someone we love (see\nAlma 42:29\n).\nSee also “Alma Counsels His Sons” (video), Gospel Library.\nAlma Counsels His Sons | Alma 36–42\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 39\nI can avoid sexual sin.\nAlma’s counsel to his son Corianton in\nAlma 39\nprovides a great opportunity to learn about the devastating effects of sexual sin, including pornography. Perhaps more important, it can also help you understand the Savior’s offer of forgiveness and healing to people who repent. These questions and activities may help:\nWhat mistakes led Corianton to break the law of chastity? (see\nAlma 39:2–4, 8–9\n). What were the consequences of his actions? (see\nverses 5–13\n). What evidence do we have that Corianton repented? (see\nAlma 42:31\n;\n49:30\n;\n48:18\n). What do you learn about the Savior from this experience?\nRead\npages 19–20\nof\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n. Then write your own explanation of what pornography is, why it is dangerous, and what you will do when you encounter it.

It’s true that we have our share of wars in the latter days, but there is value in his words beyond the descriptions of the strategy and tragedy of war. His words also prepare us for the war in which “we are all enlisted” (\nHymns\n,\nno. 250\n), the war we are fighting each day against the forces of evil. This war is very real, and the outcome affects our eternal lives. Like the Nephites, we are inspired by a holy cause—“our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children”—what Moroni called “the cause of the Christians” (\nAlma 46:12, 16\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 43–52\nJesus Christ can help me with my spiritual battles.\nAs you read\nAlma 43–52\n, notice what the Nephites did that made them successful (or unsuccessful).

        "If it weren’t for their faith, Helaman’s young soldiers would have had good reason to feel afraid. But because of their faith, they had even more reason to be courageous. As you read about them in Alma 53–58 , look for things that help you face your fears with faith in Christ. Consider focusing on the following verses: Alma 53:10–22 ; 56:43–49, 55–56 ; 57:20–27 ; and 58:39–40 . This table could help you record what you find.",

        "Helaman and Pahoran had reasons to be offended. Helaman was not receiving support for his armies, and Pahoran was falsely accused by Moroni of withholding that support (see Alma 58:4–9, 31–32 ; 60 ). What impresses you about their reactions in Alma 58:1–12, 31–37 and Alma 61 ? Why do you feel they responded this way?",
        "Elder David A. Bednar pointed to Pahoran as example of meekness and taught that “the most majestic and meaningful examples of meekness are found in the life of the Savior Himself” (“ Meek and Lowly of Heart ,” Ensign or Liahona , May 2018, 32). Ponder how the Savior showed meekness. See, for instance, Matthew 27:11–26 ; Luke 22:41–42 ; John 13:4–17 . How can you follow His example?",
        "Moroni wrote that God would hold Pahoran responsible if he knowingly neglected the needs of the Nephite armies. What do you learn from Alma 60:7–14 about caring for people in need? What can you do to be more aware of and meet the needs of others?",

Alma 53–63,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nTwo Thousand Young Warriors\n, by Arnold Friberg\nAugust 19–25: “Preserved by His Marvelous Power”\nAlma 53–63\nWhen compared with the Lamanite armies, Helaman’s “little army” (\nAlma 56:33\n) of young men shouldn’t have stood a chance. Besides being few in number, Helaman’s soldiers “were all … very young,” and “they never had fought” (\nAlma 56:46–47\n). In some ways, their situation might seem familiar to those of us who sometimes feel outnumbered and overwhelmed in our latter-day battle against Satan and the forces of evil in the world.\nBut the army of Helaman had some advantages over the Lamanites that had nothing to do with numbers or military skill. They chose Helaman, a prophet, to lead them (see\nAlma 53:19\n); “they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them” (\nAlma 56:47\n); and they had “exceeding faith in that which they had been taught.” As a result, they were protected by “the miraculous power of God” (\nAlma 57:26\n). So when facing life’s battles, we can take courage. Helaman’s army teaches us that “there [is] a just God, and whosoever [does] not doubt, [will] be preserved by his marvelous power” (\nAlma 57:26\n).\nHelaman’s Stripling Soldiers Fight for Freedom\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nAlma 53:10–22\n;\n56:43–49, 55–56\n;\n57:20–27\n;\n58:39–40\nHaving faith in God helps me overcome fear.\nIf it weren’t for their faith, Helaman’s young soldiers would have had good reason to feel afraid. But because of their faith, they had even more reason to be courageous. As you read about them in\nAlma 53–58\n, look for things that help you face your fears with faith in Christ. Consider focusing on the following verses:\nAlma 53:10–22\n;\n56:43–49, 55–56\n;\n57:20–27\n; and\n58:39–40\n.

How can you access His power? Look for answers in President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nDrawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 39–42). You might compare his counsel with things that Helaman’s soldiers did.\nAfter studying these things, think about your own spiritual battles.

While your egg and potato are cooking, study\nAlma 62:39–51\n, and notice how the people reacted to Helaman’s ministry after their long war with the Lamanites. You could then compare this to how they had reacted to his preaching 13 years earlier (see\nAlma 45:20–24\n). How were the Nephites affected differently by the same afflictions? When the egg and potato are fully cooked, crack the egg and cut the potato. How did the boiling water affect them differently? What are you learning about how we can choose to react to affliction? How can you turn to God during your afflictions?\nDraw on experiences in the home.\nIf you teach a Church class, ask class members to share what they learned at home.

Helaman 1–6,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nAugust 26–September 1: “The Rock of Our Redeemer”\nHelaman 1–6\nThe book of Helaman records both triumphs and tragedies among the Nephites and Lamanites. It begins with “a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites” (\nHelaman 1:1\n), and the difficulties keep coming throughout the record. Here we read about political intrigue, bands of robbers, rejection of the prophets, and pride and disbelief throughout the land. But we also find examples like Nephi and Lehi and “the more humble part of the people,” who not only survived but thrived spiritually (\nHelaman 3:34\n). How did they do it? How did they stay strong while their civilization began to decline and fall apart? The same way any of us stay strong in the “mighty storm” the devil sends to “beat upon [us]”—by building our lives “upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, … a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall” (\nHelaman 5:12\n).\nNephi and Lehi Testify of Christ and Are Protected By Divine Power\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHelaman 1–6\nPride separates me from the Spirit and strength of God.\nAs you read\nHelaman 1–6\n, you may notice a pattern in the behavior of the Nephites. When they are righteous, God blesses them, and they prosper. After a time, they become prideful and wicked, making choices that lead to destruction and suffering. Then they are humbled and inspired to repent, and God blesses them once again. The pattern repeats itself so often that some call it the “pride cycle.”\nThe “pride cycle”\nLook for examples of this cycle as you read\nHelaman 1–6\n. Here are some questions to help you understand this pattern:\nWhat evidence of pride do you see among the Nephites? (see, for example,\nHelaman 3:33–34\n;\n4:11–13\n). Do you see similar evidence of pride in yourself?\nWhat are the consequences of pride and wickedness? (see\nHelaman 4:23–26\n). What are the consequences of humility and repentance? (see\nHelaman 3:27–30, 35\n;\n4:14–16\n).\nWhat things did Helaman want his sons to remember? (see\nHelaman 5:4–12\n). In what ways can remembering these truths help you avoid becoming prideful?\nSee also “\nChapter 18: Beware of Pride\n,”\nTeachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson\n(2014), 229–40; “\nI Need Thee Every Hour\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 98.\nHelaman 3:24–35\nFaith in Christ fills my soul with joy.\nIn\nHelaman 3\n, Mormon described a time of rejoicing when the Church was so blessed that even the leaders were surprised. Based on what you read in\nverses 24–32\n, what do you think led to that joyful state? Not all members continued in the joy, though. Note the differences between the people described in\nverses 33–35\n. What do you learn from their example?\nLook for personal application.\nThe prophet Mormon used the phrase “thus we see” to emphasize important truths as he abridged the Book of Mormon. For example, what did he want us to see in\nHelaman 3:27–30\n? As you study the scriptures, you might pause occasionally to complete the phrase “and thus we see” regarding what you have read.\nHelaman 5:6–7\nI can honor the Savior’s name.\nReading\nHelaman 5:6–7\nmay inspire you to consider the names you have been given, including family names. What do these names mean to you? How can you honor them? Even more important, consider what it means to bear the Savior’s name (see\nMoroni 4:3\n). How do you honor that sacred name?\nHelaman 5:12–52\nIf I make Jesus Christ my foundation, I cannot fall.\nWhat does it mean to you to “build your foundation” on “the rock of our Redeemer”? (\nHelaman 5:12\n). How have you found safety from life’s storms in Jesus Christ? As you read\nHelaman 5:12–52\n, identify how Nephi and Lehi were blessed for building their faith on the rock of their Redeemer.\nSome people find it helpful to visualize what they’re studying. To depict\nHelaman 5:12\n, you could build a small structure on different kinds of foundations. You could then create a “mighty storm” by spraying water on it and using a fan to create wind. What insights does this give you about building your foundation on Jesus Christ? What else do you learn from the video “A Secure Anchor”? (Gospel Library).\nA Secure Anchor\nVerse 50\nmentions “the greatness of the evidences” that the Lamanites received. Reading\nHelaman 5:12–52\nmight bring to your mind the evidences that God has given you. For example, maybe “a whisper” from the Spirit has strengthened your faith in the Savior (\nHelaman 5:30\n; see also\nDoctrine and Covenants 88:66\n). Or perhaps you’ve been in darkness and cried out to God for greater faith (see\nHelaman 5:40–47\n). What other experiences have helped you build your foundation on Jesus Christ?\nSee also Russell M.

When you talk about the voice the people heard, speak in a soft voice. Repeat the story a few times, and invite the children to whisper with you. Help them think of other ways that the Holy Ghost can speak to us. To reinforce this principle, you could sing together “\nThe Still Small Voice\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 106–7).\nChapter 37: Nephi and Lehi in Prison\nHelaman 5:20–52\nRepentance replaces spiritual darkness with light.\nTo emphasize what\nHelaman 5:20–41\nteaches about darkness and light, try reading or summarizing these verses in the dark, using just a flashlight for light. Your children could listen for what the people needed to do so the darkness would be removed. Then turn the lights on, and read\nverses 42–48\ntogether. What do these verses teach us about repentance?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nEven in prison, Nephi and Lehi were protected by the power of God.\n©\nThe Book of Mormon for Young Readers\n,\nNephi and Lehi Encircled by a Pillar of Fire\n, by Briana Shawcroft; may not be copied\nOpen PDF"

It’s clear that Nephi did remember because this is the same message he declared years later “with unwearyingness” to the people (\nHelaman 10:4\n). “How could you have forgotten your God?” he asked (\nHelaman 7:20\n). All of Nephi’s efforts—preaching, praying, performing miracles, and petitioning God for a famine—were attempts to help the people turn to God and remember Him. In many ways, forgetting God is an even bigger problem than not knowing Him. And it’s easy to forget Him when our minds are distracted by “the vain things of this world” and clouded by sin (\nHelaman 7:21\n; see also\nHelaman 12:2\n). But, as Nephi’s ministry shows, it’s never too late to remember and “turn … unto the Lord your God” (\nHelaman 7:17\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHelaman 7–11\nProphets reveal the will of God to the people.\nHelaman 7–11\nis a particularly good place to learn about what prophets do.

How is this similar to the effort that is required to “remember the Lord”? (\nHelaman 12:5\n). How is it different?\nHelaman 12\ndescribes several things that cause people to forget the Lord. Perhaps you could list them and ponder whether they could be distracting you from Him. What helps you remember Jesus Christ? What are you inspired to do based on what you learned?\nSee also\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n; “\nReverently and Meekly Now\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 185.\nUse object lessons.\nThe Savior often related gospel principles to everyday things that people were familiar with. When learning or teaching about\nHelaman 12:1–6\n, you could compare “the unsteadiness … of men” to the way we feel trying to balance on one leg. How can we remain spiritually steady?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nHelaman 7:20–21\nThe Lord wants me to remember Him.\nTo start a conversation about remembering the Lord, you could tell your children about a time when you forgot something. Let them share similar experiences of their own. Then you could read together\nHelaman 7:20–21\nand ask your children what they think it means to forget God. Maybe your children could draw pictures of things that could cause us to forget the Lord and use their drawings to cover a picture of Jesus. Then they could think of things they can do to remember Him. As they share their thoughts, they could take away the drawings one by one until the picture of the Savior is revealed.\nHelaman 8:13–23\nProphets testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your children search\nHelaman 8:13–23\nto find names of prophets who taught about Jesus Christ. Maybe they can pass around a picture of Jesus each time they find one. What has our living prophet taught about the Savior?\nYou could also sing together a song about prophets, such as “\nFollow the Prophet\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 110–11). Maybe you and your children could pick a key phrase from the song and write one word from the phrase on each of several paper footprints. Then you could lay the footprints on the floor leading to a picture of the Savior, and your children could follow the footprints toward the picture. How has following the prophet led us to Jesus Christ?\nHelaman 10:1–4\nPondering the words of God invites revelation.\nTo help your children understand what it means to ponder, you could read together “\nPonder\n” in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library). What are some other words that are similar to\nponder\n? Perhaps you could read\nHelaman 10:1–3\ntogether and replace the word\nponder\nwith those other words. Talk with your children about ways to make pondering part of their scripture study.\nHelaman 10:11–12\nI will obey Heavenly Father.\nNephi obeyed Heavenly Father even when it meant doing something difficult. For an example of this, you and your children could read\nHelaman 10:2, 11–12\n. Maybe your children could act out what Nephi did—walk toward one side of the room (as if they are going home), stop, turn around, and walk toward the other side of the room (as if they are returning to teach the people). What are some things Heavenly Father wants us to do?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nNephi the Prophet\nThrough the gift of prophecy, Nephi solved the murder of the chief judge.\n©\nThe Book of Mormon for Young Readers\n,\nSeantum—The Murderer Is Discovered\n, by Briana Shawcroft; may not be copied\nOpen PDF"

You might say it was as if they had built an impenetrable wall around their hearts that prevented them from receiving Samuel’s message. Samuel understood the importance of the message he bore and demonstrated faith by following God’s commandment “that he should return again, and prophesy” (\nHelaman 13:3\n). Like Samuel, we all encounter walls as we “prepare the way of the Lord” (\nHelaman 14:9\n) and strive to follow His prophets. And like Samuel, we too bear witness of Jesus Christ, “who surely shall come,” and invite all to “believe on his name” (\nHelaman 13:6\n;\n14:13\n). Not everyone will listen, and some may actively oppose us. But those who believe in this message with faith in Christ find that it truly is a message of “glad tidings of great joy” (\nHelaman 16:14\n).\nSamuel the Lamanite Prophesies of Jesus Christ\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nHelaman 13\nThe Lord gives warnings through His prophets.\nIn the scriptures, prophets are sometimes compared to watchmen on a wall or tower who warn of danger (see\nIsaiah 62:6\n;\nEzekiel 33:1–7\n). As you study Samuel’s words in\nHelaman 13\n, consider how he is like a watchman for you. What did he say that seems relevant to our day? (see especially\nverses 8, 21–22, 26–29, 31, and 38\n). For example, what did Samuel teach about repentance? about humility and wealth? about seeking happiness “in doing iniquity”?\nYou might also search recent conference messages for similar warnings the Lord has given through modern prophets. What do you feel inspired to do about these warnings?\nLook for patterns.\nA pattern is a plan or model that can be used as a guide for accomplishing a task. In the scriptures, we find patterns that show how the Lord accomplishes His work, such as sending His servants to warn the people.\nAs we listen to prophets, they will point to Jesus Christ\nHelaman 13–15\nGod invites me to repent.\nSamuel’s warnings of the judgments of God consistently included a merciful invitation to repent. Look for these invitations throughout\nHelaman 13–15\n(see especially\nHelaman 13:6–11\n;\n14:15–19\n;\n15:7–8\n). What do you learn from these verses about repentance? Some people see repentance as a harsh punishment—something to avoid. In your opinion, how did Samuel want the Nephites to see repentance?\nTo deepen your study, you could read President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nWe Can Do Better and Be Better\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 67). How does he define repentance? What blessings of sincere repentance do you find in his message? You might also look for specific things the prophet invited us to change. What is the Holy Ghost telling you that you need to change? Consider writing down the personal revelation you receive.\nHow is repentance different than just changing your behavior? Why is it important to accept God’s invitation to repent? As you ponder this, consider singing or listening to a hymn that expresses this invitation, such as “\nHow Gentle God’s Commands\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 125).\nSee also “\nJesus Christ Will Help You\n,”\nFor the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices\n, 6–9; “Repentance: A Joyful Choice,” “Principles of Peace: Repentance” (videos), Gospel Library; Gospel Topics “\nRepentance\n,” Gospel Library.\nRepentance: A Joyful Choice\nPrinciples of Peace: Repentance #PrinceofPeace\nSamuel the Lamanite Prophesies of Jesus Christ\nHelaman 14\n;\n16:13–23\nGod sent signs and wonders to testify of the Savior’s birth and death.\nIn\nHelaman 14\n, Samuel explained that the Lord provided signs of the Savior’s birth and death so that the people “might know of … his coming” and “believe on his name” (\nHelaman 14:12\n). As you study\nHelaman 14\n, note the signs of the Savior’s birth in\nverses 1–8\nand the signs of His death in\nverses 20–28\n. Why do you think these signs would be effective ways to signify the birth and death of Jesus Christ?\nOther more personal and less dramatic signs can help you “believe on [the Savior’s] name.” What has He done to strengthen your belief in Him?\nWhat caution is given about signs in\nHelaman 16:13–23\n? How can you avoid the attitude of the people described in these verses?\nSee also\nAlma 30:43–52\n; Ronald A. Rasband, “\nBy Divine Design\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 55–57.\nHelaman 15:3\nChastening from the Lord is a sign of His love.\nSamuel’s words contain many stern chastisements, but\nHelaman 15:3\ngives us perspective on chastening from the Lord. How can chastisement from the Lord be a sign of His love? What evidence do you see of the Lord’s love and mercy in Samuel’s prophecies and warnings?\nConsider studying Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “\nAs Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2011, 97–100), looking for three purposes of divine chastening. When have you seen God work in these ways in your life?\nHelaman 16\nProphets point me to Jesus Christ.\nIn\nHelaman 16\n, what do you learn from people who accepted Samuel’s teachings? What do you learn from people who rejected him? Think about how following the living prophets has helped you draw closer to Jesus Christ.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nHelaman 13:2–5\nGod can speak to me in my heart.\nHow can you teach your children that God can speak to our heart, as He did for Samuel? Perhaps you could ask them to show you different ways to communicate without words (such as gestures or facial expressions). This could lead to a discussion about different ways that Heavenly Father communicates with us. As part of this discussion, you and your children could look at a picture of Samuel the Lamanite (this outline has two) and read\nHelaman 13:2–5\nas your children listen for how God told Samuel what to say.\nMany of us—especially children—need help learning to recognize\nhow\nand\nwhen\nGod is speaking to us. You might tell your children about a time when the Holy Ghost helped you know in your heart what God wanted you to do or say. Explain how you knew that God was communicating with you. Perhaps your children could also share any similar experiences they have had.\nHelaman 14:2–7, 20–25\nProphets teach about Jesus Christ.\nSinging together “\nSamuel Tells of the Baby Jesus\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 36) may be a good way to teach your children what Samuel taught about Jesus Christ. Sharing “\nChapter 40: Samuel the Lamanite Tells about Jesus Christ\n” (\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 111–13) is another. What did Samuel teach about the Savior? Perhaps you could also share what modern prophets teach about Him. How do their words build our faith in Him?\nChapter 40: Samuel the Lamanite Tells about Jesus Christ\nHelaman 16:1–6\nI am blessed as I follow the prophet.\nYou can build your children’s trust in the prophet by showing them examples of people who were faithful. Some of these are found in\nHelaman 16:1, 5\n. As you read, your children could stand up when they hear something the people did when they believed Samuel’s words. Then, as you read\nverses 2 and 6\n, your children could sit down when they hear something the people did when they did not believe. How can we show that we believe the words of the living prophet? Tell the children how you are blessed as you follow the Lord’s counsel through His prophets.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nSamuel the Prophet\nSamuel the Lamanite\n, by Lester Yocum.\nOpen PDF"

      "plain_text": "“September 16–22: ‘Lift Up Your Head and Be of Good Cheer.’ 3 Nephi 1–7,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: Book of Mormon 2024\n(2023)\n“September 16–22. 3 Nephi 1–7,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nOne Day, One Night, and One Day\n, by Jorge Cocco\nSeptember 16–22: “Lift Up Your Head and Be of Good Cheer”\n3 Nephi 1–7\nIn some ways, it was an exciting time to be a believer in Jesus Christ. Prophecies were being fulfilled—great signs and miracles among the people indicated that the Savior would soon be born. On the other hand, it was also an anxious time for believers because, in spite of all the miracles, unbelievers insisted that “the time was past” for the Savior to be born (\n3 Nephi 1:5\n). These people caused “a great uproar throughout the land” (\n3 Nephi 1:7\n) and even set a date to kill all the believers if the sign prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite—a night without darkness—did not appear.\nIn these difficult circumstances, the prophet Nephi “cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people” (\n3 Nephi 1:11\n). The Lord’s response is inspiring to anyone who faces persecution or doubt and needs to know that light will overcome darkness: “Lift up your head and be of good cheer; … I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets” (\n3 Nephi 1:13\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n3 Nephi 1–7\nBecoming converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ requires patience and effort.\n3 Nephi 1–7\ndescribes people who were converted to the Lord and others who were not. What made the difference between these groups? A chart like the following might help you organize your thoughts:\nThings that weaken conversion\nThings that strengthen conversion\n3 Nephi 1:5–11\nThings that weaken conversion\nNot believing the prophet’s words and making fun of righteous people\nThings that strengthen conversion\nHaving faith in the prophet’s words and praying for help\n3 Nephi 1:29–30\nThings that weaken conversion\nThings that strengthen conversion\n3 Nephi 2:1–3\nThings that weaken conversion\nThings that strengthen conversion\n3 Nephi 3:12–16\nThings that weaken conversion\nThings that strengthen conversion\n3 Nephi 4:8–10, 30–33\nThings that weaken conversion\nThings that strengthen conversion\n3 Nephi 6:13–18\nThings that weaken conversion\nThings that strengthen conversion\n3 Nephi 7:15–22\nThings that weaken conversion\nThings that strengthen conversion\nAsk personal questions as you study.\nFor example, while completing this chart, you could ask questions like “What is the lesson for me here?” This will bring inspiration from the Holy Ghost.\n3 Nephi 1:1–23\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I can “be of good cheer.”\nYour Heavenly Father knows that your life will include moments that are difficult, even frightening. But He also wants you to experience joy. Read\n3 Nephi 1:1–23\nto learn about the reasons the faithful Nephites had to be afraid. What reason did the Lord give them to “be of good cheer”?\nThe Savior has used the phrase “be of good cheer” on several occasions—for example, in\nMatthew 14:24–27\n;\nJohn 16:33\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 61:36\n;\n78:17–19\n. What impresses you about these invitations? You might read surrounding verses to understand the circumstances in which the Savior said these words. In each case, what reasons did He give to help people face their fears? How has he done this for you?\nConsider studying President Russell M. Nelson’s address “\nJoy and Spiritual Survival\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 81–84). What does President Nelson teach you about finding joy in any situation? Notice how many times President Nelson uses the word focus. Maybe you could compare focusing a camera or other lens to focusing on Jesus Christ. How will you focus on Him more?\nSee also “\nGrief\n,” “\nHope\n,” “\nMental Health\n,” or other topics in the “\nLife Help\n” section of the Gospel Library.\n3 Nephi 1:4–21\n;\n5:1–3\nThe Lord will fulfill all His words in His time.\nRead\n3 Nephi 1:4–7\nand think about how you might have felt if you were one of the believers. What did they do to keep their faith strong? (see\n3 Nephi 1:4–21\nand\n5:1–3\n). How were Samuel’s words fulfilled? (see\n3 Nephi 1:19–21\n). How has the Lord fulfilled His words in your life?\n3 Nephi 1:4–15\n;\n5:12–26\n;\n6:10–15\n;\n7:15–26\nI am a disciple of Jesus Christ.\nMormon declared, “Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ” (\n3 Nephi 5:13\n). What does this phrase mean to you? Consider searching\n3 Nephi 1:4–15\n;\n5:12–26\n;\n6:10–15\n; and\n7:15–26\n, looking for qualities, beliefs, and actions of disciples of Christ.\nSee also “\nI’m Trying to Be like Jesus\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 78.\nI Am a Disciple of Jesus Christ: 2024 Youth Theme - Music Video\n3 Nephi 2:11–12\n;\n3:1–26\nWhen I exercise faith in Jesus Christ, I don’t need to fear.\nThe Nephites’ experience with bands of robbers may contain lessons that can help you with the spiritual dangers you face. Look for these lessons in\n3 Nephi 2:11–12\nand\n3:1–26\n. For example, you could search Giddianhi’s words in\n3 Nephi 3:2–10\nand compare them to ways Satan might try to deceive you. What do you learn from the example of Lachoneus?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n3 Nephi 1:4–15, 19–21\nA new star appeared when Jesus Christ was born.\nThis week’s activity page\ncan help your children learn about the miracles the Nephites witnessed when Jesus was born. You can also use “\nChapter 41: The Signs of Christ’s Birth\n” (\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 114–16) to teach them this story—or to help them tell it to you.\nSigns of Jesus’s Birth\n3 Nephi 1:4–21\nThe prophets’ words are always fulfilled.\nAs you and your children read\n3 Nephi 1:4–10\n, invite them to talk about how it might have felt to be one of the believers living at that time. Then, as they read the rest of the account in\nverses 11–15\n, they could suggest ways to complete this sentence: “The lesson of this story for me is …”\nMaybe your children can help you think of other times when God fulfilled His promises given through His prophet. They might like to find pictures of these stories in the\nGospel Art Book\n(see, for example,\nnos. 7–8\nand\n81\n). Let them share what they know about these stories, including how God’s promises were fulfilled. Read together\n3 Nephi 1:20\n, and share your own witness of these truths.\n3 Nephi 2:11–12\n;\n3:13–14, 24–26\nWe are stronger when we gather together.\nHelp your children discover why the Nephites gathered together and the blessings that came to them in\n3 Nephi 2:11–12\nand\n3:13–14, 24–26\n. Why is it important for us to gather today in our families and at church?\nDo you know of an object lesson that teaches about the strength of unity? Maybe your children could try breaking one stick and then a bundle of sticks or tearing one piece of paper and then a stack of papers. How are we like the sticks or the papers?\n3 Nephi 5:12–26\n;\n6:14\n;\n7:15–26\nI am a disciple of Jesus Christ.\nAfter reading together\n3 Nephi 5:13\n, invite your children to repeat the phrase “I am a disciple of Jesus Christ.” To learn what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, read together some of these examples: the converted Lamanites (see\n3 Nephi 6:14\n), Mormon (see\n3 Nephi 5:12–26\n), and Nephi (see\n3 Nephi 7:15–26\n). You could also find ideas in a song like “\nI’m Trying to Be like Jesus\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 78–79).\nOn a piece of paper, help your children trace their hand and cut the tracing out.

With these words, the resurrected Savior introduced Himself, fulfilling over 600 years of Book of Mormon prophecies. “That appearance and that declaration,” Elder Jeffrey R. Holland wrote, “constituted the focal point, the supreme moment, in the entire history of the Book of Mormon. It was the manifestation and the decree that had informed and inspired every Nephite prophet. … Everyone had talked of him, sung of him, dreamed of him, and prayed for his appearance—but here he actually was. The day of days! The God who turns every dark night into morning light had arrived” (\nChrist and the New Covenant\n[1997], 250–51).\nSee also “Jesus Christ Appears in the Ancient Americas” (video), Gospel Library.\nJesus Christ Appears in the Ancient Americas | 3 Nephi 8–11\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n3 Nephi 8–11\nJesus Christ is the Light of the World.\nYou might notice that themes related to darkness and light are repeated throughout\n3 Nephi 8–11\n. What do you learn from these chapters about spiritual darkness and light? (see, for example,\n3 Nephi 8:19–23\n;\n9:18\n;\n10:9–13\n). What brings darkness into your life? What brings light? Why do you think the Savior introduced Himself as “the light and the life of the world”? (\n3 Nephi 9:18\n;\n11:11\n).\nThe events described in\n3 Nephi 9–11\nare among the most sacred in the Book of Mormon. Read them slowly, and ponder carefully. Here are some questions to help you. Consider recording the impressions that come to you.\nHow would I have felt if I were among these people?\nWhat impresses me about the Savior in these chapters?\nHow do I know that Jesus Christ is my Savior?\nHow has He been a light in my life?\nSee also Sharon Eubank, “\nChrist: The Light That Shines in Darkness\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 73–76.\nRecord impressions.\nWhen you write down the spiritual impressions you receive, you are more likely to receive more.\n3 Nephi 9–10\nJesus Christ is eager to forgive.\nElder Neil L. Andersen remarked, “I testify that the Savior is able and eager to forgive our sins” (“\nRepent … That I May Heal You\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2009, 40). Search\n3 Nephi 9–10\nfor evidence of Christ’s eagerness to forgive. What do you find in\n3 Nephi 9:13–22\n;\n10:1–6\nthat helps you feel His love and mercy? When have you felt Him “gather” and “nourish” you? (see\n3 Nephi 10:4\n).\nGod’s Intent Is to Bring You Home\n3 Nephi 9:19–22\nThe Lord requires “a broken heart and a contrite spirit.”\nBefore the Savior’s coming, animal sacrifices were a symbol of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice (see\nMoses 5:5–8\n). What new commandment did the Savior give in\n3 Nephi 9:20–22\n? How does it point us toward Him and His sacrifice?\nWhat does it mean to you to offer a sacrifice of a broken heart and a contrite spirit? Why do you feel the Savior wants this sacrifice from you?\n3 Nephi 11:1–8\nI can learn to hear and understand God’s voice.\nHow do you know when God is speaking to you? Perhaps the experience of the people in\n3 Nephi 11:1–8\ncan help you understand some principles of hearing and understanding God’s voice. You might note the characteristics of God’s voice that the people heard and what they did to better understand it.\nIt might also help to explore other scriptures that describe God’s voice or the influence of His Spirit. Here are a few. Perhaps, after reading these, you could write some guidelines for recognizing revelation:\n1 Kings 19:11–12\n;\nGalatians 5:22–23\n;\nAlma 32:27–28, 35\n;\nHelaman 10:2–4\n;\nEther 4:11–12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 9:7–9\n;\n11:11–14\n.\nYou could also benefit from hearing from today’s prophets, apostles, and other Church leaders who have experience hearing and following God’s voice. Several of them share their experiences in the “\nHear Him!\n” video collection in the Gospel Library. Consider watching one or more.\nHow will you apply what you learned to hear and recognize the voice of God more clearly?\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nHear Him\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 88–92; “\nThis Is My Beloved Son\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 76; Gospel Topics, “\nPersonal Revelation\n,” Gospel Library.\nOne by One\n, by Walter Rane\n3 Nephi 11:8–17\nJesus Christ invites me to gain a personal witness of Him.\nAbout 2,500 people were gathered at the temple in Bountiful when Jesus Christ appeared (see\n3 Nephi 17:25\n). Despite this large number, the Savior invited them each “one by one” to feel the nail prints in His hands and feet (\n3 Nephi 11:14–15\n). As you read, imagine what it might have been like to be there. In what ways is the Savior inviting you to “arise and come forth unto” Him? (\n3 Nephi 11:14\n).\nAs you imagine what it might have been like to learn from the resurrected Savior when He taught in Americas, consider exploring\nthis interactive experience\n.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\n3 Nephi 8–9\nWhen I am in darkness, Jesus Christ can be my light.\nTo help your children relate to the experiences described in\n3 Nephi 8–9\n, you could retell or listen to a recording of portions of these chapters in a darkened room. Discuss what it might have been like to be in darkness for three days. Then you could talk about why Jesus Christ called Himself the Light of the World (see\n3 Nephi 9:18\n). What did Jesus invite the people, and us, to do so He can be our light? (see\n3 Nephi 9:20–22\n).\n3 Nephi 10:4–6\nJesus protects His people as a hen protects her chicks.\nThe imagery of a hen gathering her chicks can be a powerful teaching tool to help children understand the Savior’s character and mission. You could read\n3 Nephi 10:4–6\nwhile your family looks at a picture of a hen and chicks. Why would a hen need to gather her chicks? Why does the Savior want to gather us close to Him? How do we come to Him for safety?\n3 Nephi 11:1–15\nJesus Christ invites me to come to Him.\nHow will you help your children feel the Spirit as you read\n3 Nephi 11:1–15\ntogether? Perhaps you could ask them to tell you when they find something in these verses that helps them feel God’s love. You could do the same with the pictures in this outline or the video “Jesus Christ Appears at the Temple” (Gospel Library). Tell your children about how you feel when you read and ponder these events. Let them share their feelings too.\nJesus Christ Appears at the Temple | 3 Nephi 11:1–17\n3 Nephi 11:1–8\nGod speaks to me in a soft, small voice.\nPerhaps you could read some of these verses in a soft, “small voice” (\n3 Nephi 11:3\n).

Kapp\nSeptember 30–October 6: “I Am the Law, and the Light”\n3 Nephi 12–16\nLike Jesus’s disciples who gathered to hear the Sermon on the Mount in Galilee, the people who gathered at the temple in Bountiful had lived the law of Moses. They had followed it because it pointed their souls to Christ (see\nJacob 4:5\n), and now Christ stood before them, declaring a higher law. But even those of us who have never lived the law of Moses can recognize that the standard Jesus set for His disciples is a high one. “I would that ye should be perfect,” He declared (\n3 Nephi 12:48\n). If this makes you feel inadequate, remember that Jesus also said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven” (\n3 Nephi 12:3\n). This higher law is an invitation—another way of saying “Come unto me and be ye saved” (\n3 Nephi 12:20\n). Like the law of Moses, this law points us to Christ—the only One who can save and perfect us. “Behold,” He said, “I am the law, and the light. Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live” (\n3 Nephi 15:9\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n3 Nephi 12–14\nI can be a true disciple of Jesus Christ.\nHere’s one way to study and apply what the Savior taught in\n3 Nephi 12–14\n: Pick a group of verses, and see if you can summarize them in one sentence that begins with “True disciples of Jesus Christ …” For example, a summary of\n3 Nephi 13:1–8\nmight be “True disciples of Jesus Christ don’t seek public praise for doing good.” Try it with these passages:\n12:3–16\n:\n12:38–44\n:\n13:19–24\n:\n14:1–5\n:\n14:21–27\n:\nOther passages that inspire you\nAfter reading these verses, what do you feel inspired to do to follow Jesus Christ?\nThe commandment in\n3 Nephi 12:48\ncan seem overwhelming—even impossible. What do you learn from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “\nBe Ye Therefore Perfect—Eventually\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 40–42) that helps you understand the Savior’s words in this verse? According to\nMoroni 10:32–33\n, what makes it possible to be perfect like the Savior?\nSee also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nThe Challenge to Become\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 2000, 32–34; “\nLord, I Would Follow Thee\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 220; “Jesus Christ Teaches How to Live the Higher Law” (video), Gospel Library.\nJesus Christ Teaches How to Live the Higher Law | 3 Nephi 12–14\nUse object lessons.\nThe Savior taught profound truths by referring to familiar objects. You could do something similar as you study or teach about\n3 Nephi 12\n. Looking at or holding some salt, a candle, or a coat could enhance a discussion about the eternal truths the Savior taught.\n3 Nephi 12:1–2\n;\n15:23–24\n;\n16:1–6\nBlessed are those who believe without seeing.\nVery few of God’s children have seen the Savior and heard His voice, as the people at Bountiful did. Most of us are more like the people described in\n3 Nephi 12:2\n;\n15:23\n; and\n16:4–6\n. What promises are made to such people in these verses? How have these promises been fulfilled in your life?\nSee also\nJohn 20:26–29\n;\n2 Nephi 26:12–13\n;\nAlma 32:16–18\n.\n3 Nephi 12:21–30\n;\n13:1–8, 16–18\n;\n14:21–23\nI can strive to purify the desires of my heart.\nOne theme you might notice in these chapters is the Savior’s invitation to live a higher law—to be righteous not only in our actions but also in our hearts. Look for this theme when the Savior speaks of contention (\n3 Nephi 12:21–26\n), immorality (\n3 Nephi 12:27–30\n), prayer (\n3 Nephi 13:5–8\n), and fasting (\n3 Nephi 13:16–18\n). What other examples can you find? What can you do to purify the desires of your heart?\n3 Nephi 14:7–11\nHeavenly Father will give me good things as I ask, seek, and knock.\nAs you read the Savior’s invitation in\n3 Nephi 14:7–11\nto ask, seek, and knock, ponder what “good things” He might want you to ask for. The following additional scriptures may help you understand how to ask, seek, and knock. They may also help explain why some prayers are not answered the way you expect:\nIsaiah 55:8–9\n;\nHelaman 10:4–5\n;\nMoroni 7:26–27, 33, 37\n; and\nDoctrine and Covenants 9:7–9\n;\n88:64\n. How might these passages affect the way you ask, seek, and knock?\nSee also Milton Camargo, “\nAsk, Seek, and Knock\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2020, 106–8.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\n3 Nephi 12:14–16\nI can be a good example by following Jesus.\nSometimes children might not realize how much their examples can bless others. Use\n3 Nephi 12:14–16\nto encourage them to let their light shine. For example, when you read “you” or “your” in these verses, ask your children to point to themselves. Tell the children about the light you see in them when they follow Jesus Christ and how it inspires you to follow Him too. You could also sing together a song that encourages the children to shine like a light, such as “\nI Am like a Star\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 163).\nTo encourage your children not to hide their light (see\n3 Nephi 12:15\n), let them take turns hiding or covering a lamp or other light. They could uncover the light each time they name something they can do to be a good example to others.\nSophia Stands for Right\n3 Nephi 13:19–21\n“Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.”\nReading these verses could prompt a discussion about the things we treasure. Maybe you could lead your children on a treasure hunt to find things that remind them of treasures with eternal value.\n3 Nephi 14:7–11\nHeavenly Father answers my prayers.\nAs you read\n3 Nephi 14:7\n, your children could do actions that represent each of the Savior’s invitations in this verse. For example, they could raise their hands (ask), make binoculars with their hands (seek), or pretend to knock on a door (knock).

In\n3 Nephi 14:7–11\n,what did the Savior want us to know about our Father in Heaven?\n3 Nephi 14:21–27\n;\n15:1\nThe Savior wants me to hear and do what He teaches.\nThink of ways you could help your children visualize the parable in these verses. Perhaps they could draw pictures, do actions, or build things on solid and sandy foundations. They could also substitute their names for “wise man” as they read\n3 Nephi 14:24–27\nor sing “\nThe Wise Man and the Foolish Man\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 281).

Kapp\nOctober 7–13: “Behold, My Joy Is Full”\n3 Nephi 17–19\nJesus Christ had just spent the day ministering in the land of Bountiful, teaching His gospel, letting the people see and feel the marks in His resurrected body, and testifying that He was the promised Savior. Now it was time to leave. “My time is at hand,” He said (\n3 Nephi 17:1\n). He was about to return to His Father, and He knew that the people needed time to ponder what He had taught. So, promising to return the next day, He dismissed the multitude to their homes. But no one left. They didn’t say what they were feeling, but Jesus could sense it: they hoped He would “tarry a little longer with them” (\n3 Nephi 17:5\n). He had other important things to do, but showing compassion for God’s children is always a high priority to Him. So Jesus stayed a little longer. What followed was perhaps the most tender example of ministering recorded in scripture. Those who were present could only say it was indescribable (see\n3 Nephi 17:16–17\n). Jesus Himself summed up the unplanned spiritual outpouring with these simple and powerful words: “Now behold, my joy is full” (\n3 Nephi 17:20\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\n3 Nephi 17\n;\n18:24–25, 28–32\nThe Savior is my perfect example of ministering.\nAbout 2,500 people were present when the Savior appeared, yet He found a way to minister to them one by one.

He might say something similar to you today, for anyone who is baptized and makes covenants with Him is also of the house of Israel, “of the covenant.” In other words, when Jesus speaks of the house of Israel, He is talking about you.

        "As the Savior’s disciples began establishing His Church throughout the land, a question came up that, to some people, might seem like a minor point—what should be the name of the Church? (see 3 Nephi 27:1–3 ). What do you learn about the importance of this name from the Savior’s answer in 3 Nephi 27:4–12 ?",
        "The Savior revealed the name of His Church today in Doctrine and Covenants 115:4 . Ponder each word in that name. How do these words help us know who we are, what we believe, and how we should act?",
        "See also Russell M. Nelson, “ The Correct Name of the Church ,” Ensign or Liahona , Nov. 2018, 87–89; “Jesus Christ Declares the Name of His Church and His Doctrine” (video), Gospel Library.",
        "After explaining that His Church must be “built upon [His] gospel” ( 3 Nephi 27:10 ), the Savior described what His gospel is. How would you summarize what He said in 3 Nephi 27:13–22 ? Based on this definition, what does it mean for the Church—and for you—to be built on His gospel?",
        "What would you say if the Savior asked you, as He asked His disciples, “What is it that ye desire of me?” ( 3 Nephi 28:1 ). Think about this as you read 3 Nephi 28:1–11 . What do you learn about the desires of the disciples’ hearts from their answers to His question? How are your desires changing as you live the gospel of Jesus Christ?",
        "Hymns often express heartfelt desires—“ More Holiness Give Me ” is a good example ( Hymns , no. 131). Consider finding a hymn that reflects your desires.",
        "Think about signs that let you know something will happen. For example, how do you know that rain is coming or the seasons are changing? According to 3 Nephi 29:1–3 , how do you know God’s work of gathering His people “is already beginning to be fulfilled”? (see also 3 Nephi 21:1–7 ). You might also note, in 3 Nephi 29:4–9 , the things that people would deny in our day. How does the Book of Mormon strengthen your faith in these things?",
        "What would it have been like to live in the years following the Savior’s visit? As you study 4 Nephi 1:1–18 , consider listing the blessings the people received. You might also mark or note the choices they made that helped lead to this blessed life. What did Jesus teach them that could have inspired their righteous choices? Here are some examples, but you may find others: 3 Nephi 11:28–30 ; 12:8–9, 21–24, 40–44 ; 13:19–21, 28–33 ; 14:12 ; 18:22–25 .",
        "Ponder what you can do to help your family, ward, or community live in greater unity and happiness. What can you do to help overcome divisions and truly become “one” with other children of God? What teachings of Jesus Christ help you accomplish this goal?",
        "Sadly, the Zion society described in 4 Nephi eventually fell into wickedness. As you read 4 Nephi 1:19–49 , look for the attitudes and behaviors that ended their happiness and unity. What can you do to help eliminate these attitudes or behaviors?",

But what he did record in\nMormon 1–6\nis enough to remind us how far people who were once righteous can fall. Amid such pervasive wickedness, no one could blame Mormon for becoming weary and even discouraged. Yet through all that he saw and experienced, he never lost his sense of God’s great mercy and his conviction that repentance is the way to receive it. And although Mormon’s own people rejected his pleading invitations to repent, he knew that he had a larger audience to persuade. “Behold,” he declared, “I write unto all the ends of the earth.” In other words, he wrote to you (see\nMormon 3:17–20\n). And his message to you, today, is the same message that could have saved the Nephites in their day: “Believe the gospel of Jesus Christ. … Repent and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ” (\nMormon 3:21–22\n).\nSee also “Moroni Preserves the Record to Bring the House of Israel to Christ” (video), Gospel Library.\nMoroni Preserves the Record for the Latter Days | Moroni 10; Title Page\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMormon 1–6\nI can follow Jesus Christ regardless of what other people do.\nBy the time he was only about 10 years old, Mormon was remarkably different from the people around him.

Things may have seemed hopeless, but Moroni found hope in Jesus Christ and his testimony that “the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on” (\nMormon 8:22\n). And Moroni knew that a key part of those eternal purposes would be the Book of Mormon—the record he was now diligently completing, the record that would one day bring many people “to the knowledge of Christ” (\nMormon 8:16\n;\n9:36\n). Moroni’s faith in these promises made it possible for him to declare to the future readers of this book, “I speak unto you as if ye were present,” and “I know that ye shall have my words” (\nMormon 8:35\n;\n9:30\n). Now we do have his words, and the Lord’s work is rolling forth, in part because Mormon and Moroni stayed true to their mission, even when they were alone.\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMormon 7\n“Believe in Jesus Christ” and “lay hold upon [His] gospel.”\nAfter abridging the record of his people, Mormon gave his concluding message in\nMormon 7\n.

Then you could read phrases from\nMormon 9:11–13, 17\nthat describe some of God’s miracles, and your children could think of other miracles (pictures from the\nGospel Art Book\n, such as nos.\n26\n,\n40\n,\n41\n, and\n83\n, can help). Talk about miracles that God has done in your life.\nShow your children a recipe, and talk about what would happen if you left out an essential ingredient. Read together\nMormon 8:24\nand\n9:20–21\nto find the “ingredients” that can lead to miracles from God.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nMoroni Overlooking the Destruction of the Nephites\n, by Joseph Brickey\nOpen PDF"

Ether 1–5,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nThe Jaredites Leaving Babel\n, by Albin Veselka\nNovember 11–17: “Rend That Veil of Unbelief”\nEther 1–5\nWhile it is true that God’s ways are higher than ours and we should always submit to His will, He also encourages us to think and act for ourselves. That’s one lesson Jared and his brother learned. For example, the idea of traveling to a new land that was “choice above all the earth” seemed to start with Jared, and the Lord granted the request, saying to the brother of Jared, “Thus I will do unto thee because this long time ye have cried unto me” (see\nEther 1:38–43\n). And when the brother of Jared needed light inside the barges that would carry them to their promised land, the Lord asked a question that we usually ask\nHim\n: “What will ye that I should do?” (\nEther 2:23\n). He wants to hear our thoughts and ideas, and He will listen and give His confirmation or counsel us otherwise. Sometimes the only thing separating us from the blessings we seek is our own “veil of unbelief,” and if we can “rend that veil” (\nEther 4:15\n), we may be surprised by what the Lord is willing to do for us.\nSee also “The Lord Appears to the Brother of Jared” (video), Gospel Library.\nThe Lord Appears to the Brother of Jared\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEther 1:33–43\nAs I cry unto the Lord, He will have compassion on me.\nEther 1:33–43\ntells of three prayers of the brother of Jared. What do you learn from the Lord’s response to each prayer? Think about a time when you have experienced the Lord’s compassion as you cried unto Him in prayer. You may want to record this experience and share it with someone who may need to hear your testimony.\nSee also “\nSecret Prayer\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 144.\nEther 2\n;\n3:1–6\n;\n4:7–15\nI can receive revelation for my life.\nPresident Russell M.

You could mark in one color the questions or concerns the brother of Jared had and what he did about them, and in another color you could mark how the Lord helped him and made His will known.\nHere are some questions to ponder as you study:\nWhat impresses you about the way the Lord answered the brother of Jared’s questions in\nEther 2:18–25\n?\nHow might you use\nEther 3:1–5\nto help someone who is learning how to pray?\nWhat might prevent you from receiving revelation from the Lord? (see\nEther 4:8–10\n). How can you receive revelation from Him more often?

What do you learn from\nEther 2:14–15\nabout the Lord’s chastening? Think about how the Lord’s chastening and the brother of Jared’s response may have helped prepare him for his experiences in\nEther 3:1–20\n.\nEther 2:16–25\nThe Lord will prepare me to cross my “great deep.”\nSometimes, crossing the “great deep” is the only way to fulfill God’s will for us. Do you see similarities to your life in\nEther 2:16–25\n? How has the Lord prepared you for your challenges?

You could also share with each other how you know the Book of Mormon is true and how you can share your witness with others.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nSawest Thou More Than This?\n, by Marcus Alan Vincent\nOpen PDF"

        "You may find spiritual insights if you compare the Jaredites’ voyage across the ocean to your journey through life. For example, what has the Lord provided that lights your way like the stones in the Jaredites’ barges? What might the barges represent, or the winds that “blow towards the promised land”? ( Ether 6:8 ). What do you learn from the actions of the Jaredites before, during, and after the voyage? How is the Lord leading you toward your promised land?",

Pondering the following questions could help you learn from these examples: Why did these Jaredites humble themselves in these situations? How did they show their humility? How did God bless them as a result? Consider what you can do to willingly “walk humbly before the Lord” ( Ether 6:17 ) rather than being compelled to be humble (see Mosiah 4:11–12 ; Alma 32:14–18 ).",

Ether 6–11,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nI Will Bring You Up Again out of the Depths\n, by Jonathan Arthur Clarke\nNovember 18–24: “That Evil May Be Done Away”\nEther 6–11\nHundreds of years after the Jaredites were destroyed, the Nephites discovered the ruins of their ancient civilization. Among these ruins was a mysterious record—plates of “pure gold” that were “filled with engravings,” and the Nephites “were desirous beyond measure” to read it (\nMosiah 8:9\n;\n28:12\n). Today you have an abridgment of this record, and it’s called the book of Ether. When the Nephites read it, “they were filled with sorrow” to learn of the tragic fall of the Jaredites. “Nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice” (\nMosiah 28:18\n). You, too, may find sorrowful moments in this book. But you can also rejoice in this gift of knowledge. As Moroni wrote, “it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you … that evil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men” (\nEther 8:23\n,\n26\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEther 6:1–12\nThe Lord will guide me through my mortal journey.\nYou may find spiritual insights if you compare the Jaredites’ voyage across the ocean to your journey through life. For example, what has the Lord provided that lights your way like the stones in the Jaredites’ barges? What might the barges represent, or the winds that “blow towards the promised land”? (\nEther 6:8\n). What do you learn from the actions of the Jaredites before, during, and after the voyage? How is the Lord leading you toward your promised land?\n“Sing praises unto the Lord.”\nThe Jaredites expressed their gratitude and love for God through song and praise (see\nEther 6:9\n). You might look for or create opportunities to use music and heartfelt testimony to praise God at home and at church. For example, it might be appropriate to sing a hymn of praise like “\nPraise the Lord with Heart and Voice\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 73) when studying\nEther 6:1–12\n.\nThe Wind Did Never Cease to Blow\nBaby on Board\n, by Kendal Ray Johnson\nEther 6:5–18, 30\n;\n9:28–35\n;\n10:1–2\n“Walk humbly before the Lord.”\nAlthough pride and wickedness seem to dominate Jaredite history, there are also examples of humility in these chapters—especially in\nEther 6:5–18, 30\n;\n9:28–35\n; and\n10:1–2\n. Pondering the following questions could help you learn from these examples: Why did these Jaredites humble themselves in these situations? How did they show their humility? How did God bless them as a result? Consider what you can do to willingly “walk humbly before the Lord” (\nEther 6:17\n) rather than being compelled to be humble (see\nMosiah 4:11–12\n;\nAlma 32:14–18\n).\nSee also Dale G.

Consider sharing with each other some experiences when God helped you during difficult times in your life.\nEther 6:9, 12, 30\n;\n7:27\n;\n10:2\nRemembering what the Lord has done brings gratitude and peace.\nAfter arriving safely in the promised land, the Jaredites were so thankful that they “shed tears of joy” (\nEther 6:12\n). You might inspire your children to feel thankful for God’s blessings by helping them find phrases from\nEther 6:9, 12\nthat show how the Jaredites expressed their thanks to God. They may enjoy singing, like the Jaredites did, a song that expresses gratitude, like “\nMy Heavenly Father Loves Me\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 195). Ask your children to tell you about some things they are thankful for.\nPerhaps your children could read\nEther 6:30\n;\n7:27\n; and\n10:2\nand find what these righteous kings remembered. How did it affect the way they led their people? You and your children could discuss ways to remind yourselves of what God has done for you. For example, maybe they could write about it or draw pictures. You might suggest that they make a regular habit of writing down blessings they notice from God (see “O Remember, Remember” [video], Gospel Library).\nO, Remember, Remember\nEther 7:24–27\nI am blessed when I follow God’s prophet.\nPerhaps you and your children would enjoy acting out some things the prophet has taught us to do. You could even turn it into a game in which you guess what the actions represent. This could prepare your children to discuss why it is important to follow God’s prophet. You could then read\nEther 7:24–27\nto find out what happened when the people obeyed God’s prophet. How are we blessed by following the prophet today?\nEther 9:28–35\n;\n11:5–8\nThe Lord is merciful when I repent.\nLooking for patterns is a useful scripture study skill. The book of Ether contains a repeated pattern that emphasizes the Lord’s mercy. To help your children find this pattern, invite them to read\nEther 9:28–35\nand\nEther 11:5–8\n, looking for similarities between the two accounts. What do we learn from these stories? Perhaps they could look for pictures in the\nGospel Art Book\nof other people in the scriptures who repented and were forgiven.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nJaredite Barges\n, by Gary Ernest Smith\nOpen PDF"

Ether 12–15,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nEther Hiding in the Cavity of a Rock\n, by Gary Ernest Smith\nNovember 25–December 1: “By Faith All Things Are Fulfilled”\nEther 12–15\nEther’s prophecies to the Jaredites were “great and marvelous” (\nEther 12:5\n). He “told them of all things, from the beginning of man” (\nEther 13:2\n). He foresaw “the days of Christ” and the latter-day New Jerusalem (\nEther 13:4\n). And he spoke of “hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God” (\nEther 12:4\n). But the Jaredites rejected his words, for the same reason people often reject the prophecies of God’s servants today—“because they [see] them not” (\nEther 12:5\n). It takes faith to believe in promises or warnings about things we can’t see, just as it took faith for Ether to prophesy of “great and marvelous things” to an unbelieving people. It took faith for Moroni to trust that the Lord could take his “weakness in writing” and turn it into strength (see\nEther 12:23–27\n). It’s this kind of faith that makes us “sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God” (\nEther 12:4\n). And it’s this kind of faith by which “all things are fulfilled” (\nEther 12:3\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nEther 12\nFaith in Jesus Christ can lead to miracles.\nIt’s common today, as it was in Ether’s day, for people to want to see evidence before believing in God and His power. What do you learn from\nEther 12:5–6\nabout this idea?\nAs you read\nEther 12\n, you might make note of every time you find the word “faith.” Consider what each instance teaches about faith. Questions like these may help: What is faith? What does it mean to exercise faith? What are the fruits of faith in Jesus Christ? You could also record your thoughts about witnesses you have gained “after the trial of your faith” (\nEther 12:6\n).\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nChrist Is Risen; Faith in Him Will Move Mountains\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2021, 101–4.\nLet others share, and sometimes teach.\nPeople learn best when they have opportunities to share what they are learning or even teach in a formal setting. Whether at home or at church, consider allowing others, including youth, to teach a part of the lesson.\nEther 12:1–9, 28, 32\nJesus Christ gives us “a more excellent hope.”\nIn addition to profound insights about faith,\nEther 12\nalso has a lot to say about hope. Let these questions guide your study:\nWhat were the reasons that Ether had to “hope for a better world”? (see\nEther 12:2–5\n).\nWhat is the purpose of an anchor? What does hope do for your soul that’s similar to what an anchor does for a boat? (see\nEther 12:4\n).\nWhat should we hope for? (see\nEther 12:4\n;\nMoroni 7:41\n).\nHow has the gospel of Jesus Christ given you “a more excellent hope”? (\nEther 12:32\n).\nSee also\nMoroni 7:40–41\n; Jeffrey R. Holland, “\nA Perfect Brightness of Hope\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2020, 81–84.\nEther 12:23–29\nJesus Christ can turn my weakness into strength.\nWhen we read Moroni’s powerful writings, it’s easy to forget that he worried about his “weakness in writing” and feared that people would mock his words (see\nEther 12:23–25\n). If you have ever felt anxious about your own weakness, read about Moroni’s struggles—and the Savior’s response—in\nEther 12:23–29\n. You might also ponder times when Jesus Christ has helped you recognize your weakness and made you strong—even if He didn’t completely remove it. Also think about weaknesses you are currently struggling with. What do you need to do to receive the Savior’s promise to “make weak things become strong”? (\nEther 12:27\n).\nConsider searching the following passages to see how others in the scriptures gained strength through the grace of Jesus Christ:\nEnoch (\nMoses 6:31–34\n;\n7:13\n)\nMoses (\nExodus 4:10–12\n;\n14:31\n)\nGideon (\nJudges 6:12–16\n;\n8:22–23\n)\nPeter (\nLuke 5:8–10\n;\n22:55–62\n;\nActs 4:13–21\n)\nMoroni (\nEther 12:23–29\n)\nJoseph Smith (\nJoseph Smith—History 1:28\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 35:17\n;\n135:3\n)\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nGrace\n,” Gospel Library; “\nThe Lord Is My Light\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 89.\nEther 13:13–22\n;\n14–15\nRejecting the Lord’s prophets puts me in spiritual danger.\nBeing king of the Jaredites was, historically, a dangerous position. This was especially true for Coriantumr, as many “mighty men … sought to destroy him” (\nEther 13:15–16\n). In\nEther 13:15–22\n, notice what Coriantumr did to protect himself and what the prophet Ether counseled him to do instead. As you read the rest of the book of Ether, ponder the consequences of rejecting the prophets. What happens to people when “the Spirit of the Lord [ceases] striving with them”? (\nEther 15:19\n). What might the Lord want you to learn from these accounts? Consider what you will do to follow His prophets.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nEther 12:6–22\nFaith is believing in things I cannot see.\nConsider helping your children repeat with you “Faith is things which are hoped for and not seen” from\nEther 12:6\n. They might enjoy looking at pictures that show the examples of faith in\nEther 12:13–15, 19–21\n(see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n78\n,\n85\n, and\nthis week’s activity page\n). Let your children explain what they know about each story. Here are some questions to help you discuss these examples of faith:\nWhat did these people hope for?\nHow was their faith tested?\nWhat happened because of their faith?\nYou could also share your own experiences exercising faith.\nEther 12:4, 32\nHope is like an anchor to my soul.\nTo understand what\nEther 12:4\nteaches about hope, you and your children could look at a picture of a boat and an anchor. Why do boats need anchors? What would happen to a boat that does not have an anchor? As you read\nEther 12:4\ntogether, talk about how hope helps us the way an anchor helps a boat. Invite your children to draw pictures of a boat and anchor so they can teach others about hope.\nIf your children need a definition of\nhope\n, help them find one in Guide to the Scriptures, “\nHope\n” (Gospel Library). According to this definition and\nEther 12:4, 32\n, what should we hope for? (see also\nMoroni 7:40–42\n). Help your children think of other words for\nhope\n, along with words that mean the opposite of\nhope\n. You could also share with each other some gospel truths that give you hope.\nEther 12:23–29\nJesus Christ can help me become spiritually strong.\nChildren sometimes face situations in which they feel weak, just as Moroni did. Help your children find out why Moroni felt this way in\nEther 12:23–25\n, and ask them if they have ever had similar feelings. Then invite them to read\nverses 26–27\nto find out how the Lord helped Moroni.\nPerhaps your children could draw a picture of something weak and something strong. Then they could add to their drawing some words and phrases from\nEther 12:23–29\nthat teach them about how the Savior can turn our weakness into strength. Encourage your children to think about a weakness they have and then seek the Savior’s help to become strong. You could also share an experience when the Savior helped you become strong enough to do something hard.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nMarvelous Were the Prophecies of Ether\n, by Walter Rane\nOpen PDF"

What more was there to say about two nations that were utterly destroyed? But Moroni had seen our times (see\nMormon 8:35\n), and he was inspired to “write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth … in some future day” (\nMoroni 1:4\n). He knew that widespread apostasy was coming, bringing with it confusion about priesthood ordinances and about religion in general. This may be why he gave clarifying details about the sacrament, baptism, conferring the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the blessings of gathering with fellow believers to “keep [each other] in the right way, … relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of [our] faith” (\nMoroni 6:4\n).

Ponder how you can be faithful to Jesus Christ, even when you face trials and opposition.\nMoroni 2–6\nPriesthood ordinances must be administered as the Lord commands.\nMoroni was running for his life when he wrote these chapters. Why would he bother to write about administrative details like how to perform ordinances? Ponder this as you read\nMoroni 2–6\n. Why do you think these details are important to the Lord? Here are some questions that could guide your study:\nConfirmation (\nMoroni 2\n;\n6:4\n).\nWhat do the Savior’s instructions in\nMoroni 2:2\nteach you about the ordinance of confirmation? How would you explain what it means to be “wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost”? (\nMoroni 6:4\n).\nPriesthood ordination (\nMoroni 3\n).\nWhat do you find in this chapter that could help someone prepare to be ordained to the priesthood?

Did you notice anything about these prayers that you hadn’t noticed before?\nConsider including a sacrament hymn in your study, such as “\nIn Memory of the Crucified\n” (\nHymns\n, no. 190).\nMoroni 6:4–9\nDisciples of Jesus Christ care for each other’s souls.\nThe choice to follow Christ is an individual one, but fellow believers can help keep us “in the right way” (\nMoroni 6:4–5\n). What did Church members in Moroni’s time do to strengthen each other? As you read\nMoroni 6:4–9\n, ponder the blessings that come from being “numbered among the people of the church of Christ” (\nMoroni 6:4\n).\nYou might also think about the people who attend your ward or branch. Is there anyone who might have special need of your love—perhaps someone who is new or recently returning? How could you help make their experiences at church more like what Moroni described? (for ideas, see\nMy Covenant Path\nor the “\nStrengthening New Members\n” videos in the Gospel Library). You might find some inspiration in\nsection I\nof President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “\nThe Need for a Church\n” (\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 24–25).\nAs you ponder what it means to be “nourished by the good word of God” (\nMoroni 6:4\n), it might help to think about the nourishment that a seedling or a baby needs—and what happens if it is neglected. Search\nMoroni 6:4–9\nfor ideas about how you can help “nourish” others spiritually. How have fellow disciples helped to nourish you?\nIt’s not obvious to everyone why it’s important to be “numbered among the people of the church of Christ” and to “meet together oft” in Church meetings. How would you explain why you are thankful to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ? (see the other sections of President Oaks’s message “\nThe Need for a Church\n”).\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMoroni 2–6\nThe Holy Ghost is a sacred gift.\nThe Holy Ghost or the Spirit is mentioned several times in\nMoroni 2–6\n. Maybe you could ask your children to find every verse that mentions Him, read these verses, and list what your children learn about the Holy Ghost. You could also share with each other experiences when you felt the Spirit’s influence.\nMoroni 4–5\nI take the sacrament to show that I will always remember Jesus Christ.\nReading the sacrament prayers with your children could lead to a discussion about how to have more meaningful experiences with the sacrament. It might help for them to imagine that a friend is coming to sacrament meeting for the first time. How would we explain to our friend what the sacrament is and why it is sacred? Encourage your children to use something from\nMoroni 4\nor\n5\nin their explanations. Younger children could use this week’s activity page or\nGospel Art Book\n,\nno. 108\n.\nConsider singing a song together that helps your children think about the Savior (such as “\nReverently, Quietly\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 26). You could also practice sitting reverently during the sacrament.\nMoroni 6:1–3\nI can prepare to be baptized.\nWho can be baptized? Help your children find answers to this question in\nMoroni 6:1–3\n. What does it mean to have a “broken heart and a contrite spirit”? (\nMoroni 6:2\n). How does this help us prepare for baptism? Consider telling your children how you prepared to be baptized.\nSophia's Baptism Promises\nMoroni 6:4–6, 9\nWe go to church to take the sacrament and support each other.\nDo your children know why you like going to church? Reading\nMoroni 6:4–6, 9\ncan give you an opportunity to discuss together some of the things we do at church. Maybe they could draw pictures of themselves doing these things (such as praying, teaching, singing, and taking the sacrament).\nAfter reading\nMoroni 6:4\ntogether, you and your children could look at pictures or examples of nourishing foods and compare nourishing our bodies to being “nourished by the good word of God.” You could also watch the video “Children Sharing the Gospel” (Gospel Library).\nChildren Sharing the Gospel\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nMoroni in the Cave\n, by Jorge Cocco\nOpen PDF"

Brigham Young University Museum of Art, 1969\nDecember 9–15: “May Christ Lift Thee Up”\nMoroni 7–9\nBefore Moroni concluded the record we know today as the Book of Mormon with his own final words, he shared three messages from his father, Mormon: an address to “the peaceable followers of Christ” (\nMoroni 7:3\n) and two letters that Mormon had written to Moroni. Perhaps Moroni included these messages in the Book of Mormon because he foresaw similarities between the perils of his day and ours. When these words were written, the Nephite people were turning away from the Savior. Many of them had “lost their love, one towards another” and delighted in “everything save that which is good” (\nMoroni 9:5, 19\n). And yet Mormon still found cause for hope, teaching us that hope does not mean ignoring or being naive about the world’s problems. Hope means having faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, whose power is greater and more everlasting than these problems. It means “lay[ing] hold upon every good thing” (\nMoroni 7:19\n). It means letting the Atonement of Jesus Christ “and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind” (\nMoroni 9:25\n).\nMormon Teaches about Faith, Hope, and Charity\nIdeas for Learning at Home and at Church\nMoroni 7:12–20\nThe Light of Christ helps me know truth from error.\nMany people wonder, “How can I know if an impression comes from God or from my own thoughts?” or “With so much deception today, how can I know what is right or wrong?” Mormon’s words in\nMoroni 7\ngive us several principles we can use to answer these questions. Look for them especially in\nverses 12–20\n. You might use these truths to help you evaluate the messages you encounter and the experiences you have this week.\nSee also Guide to the Scriptures, “\nLight, Light of Christ\n,” Gospel Library; “Patterns of Light: Discerning Light” (video), Gospel Library.\nPatterns of Light: Discerning Light\nMoroni 7:20–48\nBecause of Jesus Christ, I can “lay hold upon every good thing.”\nMormon asked a question that seems especially important today: “How is it possible [to] lay hold upon every good thing?” (\nMoroni 7:20\n). He then taught about faith in Jesus Christ, hope, and charity. As you read\nverses 20–48\n, look for how each attribute helps you find and “lay hold” on the goodness that comes from Jesus Christ. Why are these attributes essential for a disciple of Jesus Christ?\nSee also “Mormon’s Teachings about Faith, Hope, and Charity” (video), Gospel Library.\nMoroni 7:44–48\n“Charity is the pure love of Christ.”\nMormon observed that our faith and hope in Jesus Christ lead us to have charity. But what is charity? You might write\nCharity is …\nand then read\nMoroni 7:44–48\n, looking for words or phrases that could complete the sentence. When you finish, consider replacing the word\nCharity\nwith the name\nJesus Christ\n. What does this teach you about the Savior? How has Jesus Christ demonstrated His pure love? Think of examples from the scriptures and your own life.\nPresident Dallin H. Oaks observed: “The reason charity never fails and the reason charity is greater than even the most significant acts of goodness … is that charity, ‘the pure love of Christ’ [\nMoroni 7:47\n], is not an act but a condition or state of being. … Charity is something one becomes” (“\nThe Challenge to Become\n,”\nEnsign\n, Nov. 2000, 34). With this statement in mind, you might read Elder Massimo De Feo’s message “\nPure Love: The True Sign of Every True Disciple of Jesus Christ\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2018, 81–83). How does charity affect your discipleship? How can you “cleave unto charity”? (\nverse 46\n).\nSee also\n1 Corinthians 13:1–13\n;\nEther 12:33–34\n; “\nLove One Another\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 308; “Charity: An Example of the Believers” (video), Gospel Library; Gospel Topics, “\nCharity\n,” Gospel Library.\nCharity: An Example of the Believers\nUse object lessons.\nPerhaps thinking of a three-legged stool can help you understand more about the relationship between faith, hope, and charity (see Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “\nThe Infinite Power of Hope\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2008, 21–24).\nMoroni 9:3–5\nAnger leads to sorrow and suffering.\nIn contrast to Mormon’s message of love in\nMoroni 7:44–48\n, Mormon’s second epistle to Moroni included warnings against something many struggle with today—anger. According to\nMoroni 9:3–5\n, what were some of the consequences of the Nephites’ anger? What warnings can we take from\nverses 3–5, 18–20, 23\n?\nSee also Gordon B. Hinckley, “\nSlow to Anger\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2007, 62–66.\nMoroni 9:25–26\nI can have hope in Christ regardless of my circumstances.\nAfter describing the wickedness he had seen, Mormon told his son not to grieve. What impresses you about Mormon’s message of hope? What does it mean to you for Christ to “lift [you] up”? What attributes of Christ and principles of His gospel “rest in your mind” and give you hope? (\nMoroni 9:25\n).\nSee also Russell M. Nelson, “\nJoy and Spiritual Survival\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2016, 81–84.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMoroni 7:33\nIf I have faith in Jesus Christ, I can do whatever He needs me to do.\nConsider looking at a few pictures together that show someone from the scriptures accomplishing something important (see, for example,\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n19\n,\n70\n,\n78\n,\n81\n). How did having faith in Christ make a difference in these examples? You and your children could then read\nMoroni 7:33\n, looking for what we can do when we have faith in Jesus Christ. You could also share experiences with each other when God blessed you with power to do His will.\nMoroni 7:41\nBelieving in Jesus Christ can give me hope.\nAs you read\nMoroni 7:41\nto your children, perhaps they could raise their hands when they hear something Mormon said we should hope for. Tell them about the hope you feel because of Jesus Christ.\nYou and your children could also think of someone who may be having a hard time with something. Maybe your children could draw a picture for the person that can remind him or her to have hope in Jesus Christ.\nMoroni 7:40–41\n;\n9:25–26\nI can have hope in Jesus Christ, even during difficult trials.\nTo teach your children about hope in Jesus Christ, you could fill a clear container with water and drop two objects into it—one that floats and one that sinks. As you read together\nMoroni 7:40–41\nand\n9:25–26\n, your children could look for what hope does for us. Then they could compare the floating object to a person who has hope in Christ. How does He “lift [us] up” when we face difficult trials? Help your children think of ways they can keep the Savior and His encouraging teachings “in [their] mind forever.”\nMoroni 7:45–48\n“Charity is the pure love of Christ.”\nA song about love, such as “\nLove One Another\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 136), may start a discussion about what charity is. You could read or summarize\nMoroni 7:47\nand invite your children to draw pictures of themselves showing love to someone. Suggest that they put their picture where it will remind them to love others as Jesus does.\nHow can you inspire your children to seek and develop the pure love of Christ in their lives? Perhaps you could help them think of ways that Jesus showed charity (see, for example,\nLuke 23:34\n;\nJohn 8:1–11\n;\nEther 12:33–34\n). How can we follow His example?\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nPortrait of Christ the Savior\n, by Heinrich Hofmann\nOpen PDF"

Moroni 10,”\nCome, Follow Me—For Home and Church: 2024\n(2023)\nThat Ye May Know\n, by Gary L. Kapp\nDecember 16–22: “Come unto Christ, and Be Perfected in Him”\nMoroni 10\nThe Book of Mormon opens with Nephi’s promise to show us that “the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith” (\n1 Nephi 1:20\n). The book closes with a parallel invitation from Moroni: “Remember how merciful the Lord hath been” (\nMoroni 10:2–3\n). What examples of the Lord’s mercy have you seen in the Book of Mormon? You might think of the merciful way God led Lehi’s family through the wilderness and across the great waters, the tender mercies He showed to Enos when his soul hungered for forgiveness, or the mercy He showed to Alma, a bitter enemy of the Church who became one of its fearless defenders. Or your thoughts might turn to the mercy the resurrected Savior showed to the people when He healed their sick and blessed their little children. Perhaps most important, all of this can remind you of “how merciful the Lord hath been” to you, for the Book of Mormon was written to invite each of us to receive God’s mercy—an invitation expressed simply in Moroni’s farewell words, “Come unto Christ, and be perfected in him” (\nMoroni 10:32\n).\nIdeas for Learning at Church and at Home\nMoroni 10:3–7\nI can know the truth of all things by the power of the Holy Ghost.\nThe promise in\nMoroni 10:3–7\nhas changed the lives of millions of people around the world. How has it changed yours? As you read\nMoroni 10:3–7\n, consider reading more carefully than you may have in the past. You could examine each phrase, asking yourself questions like these: What does this mean? How can I do this better? What experiences have I had with this?\nAs you ponder your personal search for spiritual truth, it might help to learn how others have found truth by the power of the Holy Ghost. Elder Mathias Held described his experience as a new member of the Church (see “\nSeeking Knowledge by the Spirit\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 31–33). Elder David F. Evans described his experience as one who was raised in the Church but still had questions (see “\nThe Truth of All Things\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2017, 68–70). Consider reading one or both of these messages and writing down anything you learn from their searches for truth that help you with your own.\nYou might also explore what God has taught about truth by reading some of the passages in Guide to the Scriptures, “\nTruth\n” (Gospel Library). Which scriptures seem especially insightful to you? Perhaps you could pick one to share with someone else who is also seeking truth by the Spirit.\nSee also Henry B. Eyring, “\nThe Faith to Ask and then to Act\n,”\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2021, 74–76; “\nLet the Holy Spirit Guide\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 143; Gospel Topics, “\nSeeking Truth and Avoiding Deception\n,” Gospel Library.\nRecord impressions.\nBeing converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ means both knowing and living the gospel. You’re more likely to act on what you learn if you write it down. If you are teaching, invite the people you teach to record their spiritual impressions.\nMoroni 10:8–25\nGod has given me spiritual gifts.\nThere are many ways a person might “deny … the gifts of God” (\nMoroni 10:8\n). Some people deny that these gifts even exist. Others deny their gifts by simply neglecting them or failing to develop them. As you read\nMoroni 10:8–25\n, look for truths that will help you discover your spiritual gifts and use them to bless God’s children. Questions like these may help: What are spiritual gifts? Who are they given to? Why are they given? How do we receive them? Can you think of examples of people using the gifts listed in\nMoroni 10:9–16\n?\nMoroni 10:30–33\nI can be perfected through the grace of Jesus Christ.\nMoroni’s counsel to “come unto Christ” involves more than learning of and thinking about Him. Rather, this is an invitation to come unto Christ in the most complete sense possible—to become as He is. As you read\nMoroni 10:30–33\n, notice phrases that help you understand what it means to come to Christ, how it is made possible, and the results for doing so.\nLook back on your study of the Book of Mormon this year, and ponder what you have felt and learned about Jesus Christ. For example, how has the Book of Mormon helped you come unto Him? How has it helped you rely more completely on His grace? How has it helped you to “deny not” the Savior’s power? Consider sharing your own witness of the Book of Mormon with someone who needs to hear it, including loved ones and friends who may not know of its message.\nSee also “Moroni Invites All to Come unto Christ” (video), Gospel Library.\nMoroni Invites All to Come unto Christ | Mormon 8–9; Moroni 1, 10; Title Page\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nMoroni 10:3–4\nI can know for myself that the Book of Mormon is true.\nHow can you help your children accept Moroni’s invitation to ask God if the Book of Mormon is true? Consider giving them slips of paper with the words\nRead\n,\nRemember\n,\nPonder\n, and\nAsk\nwritten on them. Your children could find these words in\nMoroni 10:3–4\n. What should we read, remember, ponder, and ask to gain or strengthen our testimonies of the Book of Mormon? Your children could also look for similarities between these verses and the song “\nSearch, Ponder, and Pray\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 109).\nYour children could use the picture at the end of this outline to talk about Moroni burying the gold plates (see also “\nChapter 54: The Promise of the Book of Mormon\n,”\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 156). Younger children may enjoy pretending to be Moroni writing on the plates and burying them. Share with each other your testimonies of the Book of Mormon.\nMoroni the Prophet\nMoroni 10:8–19\nHeavenly Father gives me spiritual gifts.\nTo teach your children about spiritual gifts, you could write the numbers 9 through 16 on separate pieces of paper and wrap each paper like a gift. Your children could take turns unwrapping the gifts, reading verses from\nMoroni 10:9–16\nthat correspond with the numbers, and identifying each spiritual gift. You could talk about how Heavenly Father wants us to use these gifts to bless His children. You could also help your children notice the gifts that Heavenly Father has given them.\nMoroni 10:32–33\nJesus Christ wants me to come unto Him.\nDo your children know what it means to “come unto Christ”? Maybe you could read\nMoroni 10:32\nand invite them to repeat the phrase with you. They could then close their eyes while you place a picture of Jesus somewhere in the room. Then let them open their eyes, find the picture, gather around it, and talk about ways that we can come unto Christ. Maybe it would help to write down the question\nWhat does it mean to come unto Christ?\nHelp them search\nMoroni 10:32–33\nto find possible answers (see also\nArticles of Faith 1:3–4\n). Work together to list what Christ wants us to do and what He promises to do for us.\nMaybe your children would enjoy making and decorating heart-shaped badges that say “I love God with all my might, mind, and strength” (see\nMoroni 10:32\n). As they do, talk with them about how we show God that we love Him.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nBefore burying the records, Moroni invited us to “remember how merciful the Lord hath been” (\nMoroni 10:3\n)\nOpen PDF"

One stood on a wall to proclaim the signs of His birth and His death, and another knelt before His resurrected body, touching the wounds in His hands, feet, and side. All of them knew this essential truth: “There is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who … cometh to redeem the world” (\nHelaman 5:9\n).\nSo during this Christmas season, as believers around the world celebrate the goodness and love of God in sending His Son, ponder how the Book of Mormon has strengthened your faith in Christ.

You might look at his list and ponder how each of these truths has changed—or could change—your life.\nSee also Gospel Topics, “\nBook of Mormon\n,” Gospel Library.\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issues of the\nLiahona\nand\nFor the Strength of Youth\nmagazines.\nIdeas for Teaching Children\nBecause this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “\nAppendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nJesus Christ is Heavenly Father’s gift to me.\nTo help your children focus on the gift Heavenly Father gave us by sending His Son, you could wrap a picture of Jesus Christ like a Christmas present. You and your children could talk about favorite Christmas gifts you have received or hope to receive. Then they could unwrap the picture of Christ and discuss how He has been a precious gift for us. A song like “\nHe Sent His Son\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 34–35) could add to this conversation. Help your children find phrases in the song that describe blessings we have because of Jesus’s birth.\nJesus Christ was born to be my Savior.\nYour children might enjoy sharing with you what they know about Jesus’s birth. The\nGospel Art Book\nhas several pictures that could help them tell the story (see nos.\n28\n,\n29\n,\n30\n,\n31\n). You could also look at pictures depicting the Savior’s life and atoning sacrifice. Why did Heavenly Father send Jesus Christ?\nYour children might also enjoy drawing their own pictures of Jesus’s birth and ministry. Maybe they could draw what is described in\n1 Nephi 11:13–23\n;\nMosiah 3:5–10\n;\nHelaman 14:1–13\n; and\n3 Nephi 1:4–22\n. Then they could share with you what their pictures teach about Jesus Christ.\nTo emphasize that the Bible and Book of Mormon both teach of Jesus’s birth, you could list the events described in\nLuke 2:4–14\n;\nMatthew 2:1–2\n; and\n3 Nephi 1:15, 19–21\n. Then your children could search these scriptures to determine which events happened in Bethlehem, the Americas, or both. Why are we thankful to have the Book of Mormon as a second witness of Jesus’s birth?\nChildren love stories.\nStories are one of the best ways to help children learn and remember truths. As you share the story of Jesus’s birth, consider also sharing stories from your life that have helped to strengthen your faith in the Savior.\nThe Book of Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ.\nAs you and your children conclude your study of the Book of Mormon this year, it might be a good time to share with each other your favorite stories or passages from this sacred book. Looking at some of the pictures in\nCome, Follow Me\nor\nBook of Mormon Stories\ncould help your children remember what they’ve been learning this year. Help them see what these stories teach us about Jesus Christ.\nYou could also give your children a picture of Jesus, or let them draw their own. Invite them to hold up their pictures each time they hear Christ’s name as you read\n2 Nephi 25:23, 26\n. Testify that the Book of Mormon was written to help us “believe in Christ” (\n2 Nephi 25:23\n).\nFor more ideas, see this month’s issue of the\nFriend\nmagazine.\nNephi’s Vision of the Virgin Mary\n, by Judith A.

This includes helping them prepare to make and keep sacred covenants, such as the covenant of baptism and the covenants made in the temple. Through these covenants, your children will bind themselves to the Savior, Jesus Christ.\nThere are many ways to prepare your children for this journey on the covenant path, and Heavenly Father will help you discover the best way to help them. As you seek inspiration, keep in mind that not all learning happens during scheduled lessons. In fact, part of what makes learning at home so powerful is the opportunity to learn by example and through small, simple moments—the kind that occur naturally in the flow of daily living. Just as following the covenant path is a consistent, lifelong process, so is learning about the covenant path. (See “\nHome and Family\n,”\nTeaching in the Savior’s Way\n[2022], 30–31.)\nThere are many ways to prepare your children for their journey on God’s covenant path.\nBelow are some ideas that may lead to further inspiration. You can find additional ideas for teaching Primary-age children in “\nAppendix B: For Primary—Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path\n.”\nBaptism and Confirmation\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” (\n2 Nephi 31:17\n). Your efforts to help your children prepare for baptism and confirmation can set their feet firmly on that path. These efforts begin with teaching about faith in Jesus Christ and repentance. They also include teaching about how we renew our baptismal covenants by partaking of the sacrament each week.\nHere are some resources that can help you:\n2 Nephi 31\n;\nspecial issue\nof the\nFriend\nmagazine about baptism; Gospel Topics, “\nBaptism\n,” Gospel Library.\nWhenever you have an experience that strengthens your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, share it with your child. Help them understand that faith is something that can grow stronger and stronger throughout life. What are some things your child can do to develop stronger faith in Christ before they are baptized?\nWhen your child makes a wrong choice, speak joyfully about the gift of repentance. And when you make a wrong choice, share the joy that comes when you repent. Testify that because Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, He gave us power to change. When your child seeks forgiveness, forgive freely and joyfully.\nTell your child about your baptism. Show pictures and share memories. Talk about how you felt, how your baptismal covenants have helped you come to know Jesus Christ better, and how they continue to bless your life. Encourage your child to ask questions.\nWhen there is a baptism in your family or your ward, take your child to see it. Talk together about what you and your child saw and felt. If possible, talk to the person being baptized and ask questions like the following: “How did you make this decision? How did you prepare?”\nWhenever you notice your child doing something they promised to do, give sincere praise. Point out that keeping commitments helps us prepare to keep the covenants we make when we are baptized. What do we promise God when we are baptized? What does He promise us? (see\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n).\nWhen you and your child have a sacred experience together (such as at church, while reading the scriptures, or while serving someone), tell them about the spiritual feelings or impressions you have. Invite your child to share how they feel. Note the variety of ways the Spirit can speak to people, including ways He speaks to you personally. Help your child recognize moments when they may be experiencing the influence of the Holy Ghost.\nWatch together a few of the videos in the Gospel Library collection titled “\nHear Him!\n” Talk together about the different ways the Lord’s servants hear His voice. Invite your child to draw a picture or make a video about how they hear the Savior’s voice.\nTalk about how becoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has blessed you. How have you come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ as you have served others and as others have served you? Help your child think of ways to serve and strengthen others as a member of the Church.\nMake the sacrament a sacred and joyful event in your family. Help your child plan ways to focus on Jesus Christ during the sacrament. How will we show that the sacrament is sacred to us?\nMany issues of the\nFriend\nmagazine include articles, stories, and activities to help children prepare for baptism and confirmation. Let your child choose some to read and enjoy with you. (See also the collection “\nPreparing for Baptism\n” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library.)\nNephi taught that “the gate by which [we] enter” the covenant path “is repentance and baptism by water” (\n2 Nephi 31:17\n).\nPriesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nThe priesthood is the authority and power of God by which He blesses His children. God’s priesthood is on the earth today in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All Church members who keep their covenants—including children—are blessed with God’s priesthood power in their homes to strengthen themselves and their families (see\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n3.5\n, Gospel Library). This power will assist members in doing God’s work of salvation and exaltation in their personal lives and families (see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n2.2\n).\nWe receive ordinances by the authority of the priesthood. When men and women serve in Church callings, they do so with priesthood authority, under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys. All of Heavenly Father’s children—His sons and His daughters—will be blessed as they come to better understand the priesthood.\nTo learn more about the priesthood, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; Russell M. Nelson, “\nThe Price of Priesthood Power\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 66–69; “\nPriesthood Principles\n,” chapter 3 in\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nMake priesthood ordinances a consistent part of your family life. For example, help your child prepare spiritually for the sacrament each week. Encourage your child to seek priesthood blessings when they are sick or need comfort or direction. Make it a habit to point out ways the Lord is blessing your family through priesthood power.\nAs you read the scriptures together, watch for opportunities to discuss how God blesses people through His power. Share your own experiences of when God has blessed you through His priesthood. For examples of blessings we receive from God through the priesthood, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.2\n,\n3.5\n.\nLearn the priesthood line of authority of someone in your family. (Melchizedek Priesthood holders can receive a copy of their line of authority by sending an email to\nLineofAuthority@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n; see also “\nRequest a Priesthood Line of Authority\n” in the Help Center on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.) Talk about why it’s important to know that priesthood authority comes from Jesus Christ Himself. Why does He share it with us?\nTeach your child that after baptism, they can receive priesthood power by keeping the baptismal covenant. Review together President Russell M. Nelson’s message “\nSpiritual Treasures\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79). Tell your child how priesthood ordinances have brought God’s power into your life. For a list of some of the ways we are blessed by priesthood power, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.5\n.\nDiscuss the question “What is a servant of the Lord like?” Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:36–42\n, and look for answers. Whenever you notice your child (or someone else) applying one of the principles or attributes in these verses, point it out.\nWhen you or your child uses keys to unlock a door or start a car, take a moment to compare those keys to the keys that priesthood leaders hold. (For a definition of priesthood keys, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n3.4.1\n). What do priesthood keys “unlock” or “start” for us? See also Gary E. Stevenson, “\nWhere Are the Keys and Authority of the Priesthood?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 29–32; “\nWhere Are the Keys?\n” (video), Gospel Library.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nWhen you are set apart for a calling, invite your child to be present, if possible. Let your child see you fulfilling your calling. You might even look for appropriate ways they can help you. Describe how you feel the Lord’s power in your calling.\nGoing to the Temple—Baptisms and Confirmations for the Dead\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Heavenly Father as we participate in sacred ordinances, all of which point to Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father has provided a way for all His children to make covenants and participate in ordinances, including people who did not receive them in this life. At the beginning of the year they turn 12, your child is old enough to be baptized and confirmed in the temple for deceased ancestors.\nAttend the temple as often as your circumstances allow. Talk to your child about why you are going and how the temple helps you feel closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nReview and discuss the\ntemple recommend questions\ntogether. Talk to your child about what happens in a temple recommend interview. Share why having a temple recommend is important to you.\nRead together\nMalachi 4:6\n. Talk about how your hearts could turn to your ancestors. Learn more about your ancestors by exploring your family history together on\nFamilySearch.org\n. Look for ancestors who need to be baptized and confirmed. A ward temple and family history consultant can help you.\nReview together some of the resources in the collection titled “\nTemple\n” in the children’s section of the Gospel Library. (See also “\nPreparing Your Child for Temple Baptisms and Confirmations\n” on\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.)\nReceiving a Patriarchal Blessing\nA patriarchal blessing can be a source of guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It contains personal counsel from Heavenly Father to us and helps us understand our eternal identity and purpose. Help your child prepare to receive a patriarchal blessing by teaching them the significance and sacred nature of patriarchal blessings.\nTo learn more, see Gospel Topics, “\nPatriarchal Blessings\n,” Gospel Library.\nShare with your child your experience of receiving a patriarchal blessing. You could share things like how you prepared to receive it, how it has helped you come closer to God, and how you use the blessing in your life. You could also invite your child to talk to other family members who have received their patriarchal blessings.\nTake time to review together some of the resources in Gospel Topics, “\nPatriarchal Blessings\n.” To learn about the process of receiving a patriarchal blessing, see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n18.17\n.\nIf you have ancestors who received patriarchal blessings, it might be inspiring to read some of them with your child. To request the blessings of ancestors who have died, log in to\nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, click the account icon at the top right corner of the screen, and select “Patriarchal Blessing.”\nAfter your child has received a patriarchal blessing, invite any family members who were present to record their feelings and to share them with your child.\nGoing to the Temple—the Endowment\nGod wants to endow, or bless, all His children with “power from on high” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 95:8\n). We go to the temple to receive our own endowment only once, but the covenants we make with God and the spiritual power He gives us as part of the endowment can bless us every day of our lives.\nDisplay a picture of the temple in your home. Tell your child about the feelings you experience in the temple. Talk often about your love for the Lord and His house and the covenants you have made there.\nExplore together\ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Read together articles like “\nAbout the Temple Endowment\n” and “\nPrepare for the House of the Lord\n.” Let your child ask any questions they have about the temple. For guidance about what you can talk about outside the temple, see Elder David A. Bednar’s message “\nPrepared to Obtain Every Needful Thing\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 101–4; see especially the section titled “\nHome-Centered and Church-Supported Learning and Temple Preparation\n”).\nAs you and your child participate in or witness other ordinances (such as the sacrament or a blessing of healing), take a moment to discuss the symbolism involved in the ordinance. What do the symbols represent? How do they testify of Jesus Christ? This can help your child prepare to ponder the symbolic meaning of temple ordinances, which also testify of Jesus Christ.\nHelp your child notice how they are keeping the baptismal covenant described in\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n. Also help your child notice how the Lord is blessing them. Build your child’s confidence in their ability to keep covenants.\nTalk openly and frequently about how your temple covenants guide your choices and help you grow closer to Jesus Christ. You could use\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n27.2\n, to review the covenants we make in the temple.\nServing a Mission\nElder David A. Bednar taught: “The single most important thing you can do to prepare for a call to serve is to\nbecome\na missionary long before you\ngo\non a mission. … The issue is not going on a mission; rather, the issue is becoming a missionary and serving throughout our entire life with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength. … You are preparing for a lifetime of missionary work” (“\nBecoming a Missionary\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2005, 45–46). The experiences your child has\nbecoming\na missionary will bless them eternally, not just for the period of time they may serve as a missionary.\nTo learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nPreaching the Gospel of Peace\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 6–7; M. Russell Ballard, “\nMissionary Service Blessed My Life Forever\n,”\nLiahona\n, May 2022, 8–10;\nMissionary Preparation: Adjusting to Missionary Life\n, Gospel Library.\nModel how to share the gospel in natural ways. Always be alert to opportunities to share with others your feelings about Heavenly Father and the Savior and the blessings you receive as a member of His Church. Invite others to join your family in Church- and family-related activities.\nLook for opportunities for your family to interact with missionaries. Invite them to teach your friends, or offer to let them teach people in your home. Ask the missionaries about the experiences they’re having and how missionary service is helping them draw closer to Jesus Christ. Also ask what they did (or wish they had done) to prepare to be missionaries.\nIf you served a mission, talk openly and often about your experiences. Or invite friends or family members who served missions to talk about theirs. You could also talk about ways you’ve shared the gospel with others throughout your life. Help your child think of ways they can share the gospel.\nGive your child opportunities to teach your family principles of the gospel. Your child could also practice sharing their beliefs with others. For example, you could discuss questions like “How would we introduce the Book of Mormon to someone who has never heard of it?” or “How would we describe the need for the Savior to someone who is not a Christian?”\nHelp your child become comfortable talking to people. What are some good ways to start a conversation? Encourage your child to learn how to listen to what others say, understand what is in their hearts, and share truths of the gospel that could bless their lives.\nLook for opportunities for your child to learn about other cultures and faiths. Help them recognize and respect the good and true principles in others’ beliefs.\nGoing to the Temple—Sealing\nIn the temple, a husband and wife can be married for eternity. This occurs in an ordinance called sealing. Even though this ordinance may be many years away for your daughter or son, the small, simple, consistent things you do together during those years can help them prepare for this wonderful blessing.\nRead together “\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n” in Gospel Library. What does this proclamation teach about happiness in family life and about successful marriages? With your child, choose one of the principles listed in the proclamation to study. You could look up scriptures related to that principle in the\nGuide to the Scriptures\n. You could also set goals to apply that principle more fully in your family. As you work on your goals, discuss together the effect that living that principle has on family life.\nWith your child, read President Dieter F. Uchtdorf’s message “\nIn Praise of Those Who Save\n” (\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2016, 77–80). When you get to the section titled “\nA Society of Disposables\n,” you might look for things in your home that are disposable and other things that are not. Talk about how you treat things differently when you want them to last a long time. What does this suggest about how we should treat marriage and family relationships? What else do we learn from President Uchtdorf’s message about how the Savior can help us build strong marriages and families?\nIf you are married, be open with your child about the things you feel you’re doing well as a couple, the things you’re learning, and the ways you’re trying to improve. If you and your spouse have been sealed in the temple, show your child by example how you strive to keep your covenants with each other and with the Lord. Tell your child how you strive to make Heavenly Father and the Savior the center of your relationship and how They are helping you.\nWhen family decisions need to be made, hold family councils and discussions. Make sure that all family members’ opinions are heard and valued. Use these discussions as an opportunity to model healthy communication and kindness in family relationships, even when not everyone sees things the same way.\nWhen there is disagreement or conflict in the family, demonstrate patience and compassion. Help your child see how handling conflict in Christlike ways can help them prepare for a happy marriage. Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 121:41–42\n, and talk about how the principles in these verses can be applied to marriage."

He said that we can enter the kingdom of God if we have faith, repent, are baptized, receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end (see\n3 Nephi 11:31–40\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:29\n). The activities below can help you teach the children that these principles and ordinances will help us draw closer to the Savior throughout our lives.\nTo learn more about the doctrine of Christ, see\n2 Nephi 31\n.\nPossible Activities\nGive the children pictures that represent faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, and confirmation (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n1\n,\n111\n,\n103\n, and\n105\n). Read or recite with the children the\nfourth article of faith\n, and ask them to hold up their pictures when that principle or ordinance is mentioned. Help the children understand how each of these principles and ordinances helps us become more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.\nHow can you help the children understand that faith, repentance, baptism, and confirmation are not one-time events but influence our spiritual growth throughout our lives? For instance, you could show them a picture of a seed and a large tree (or draw these things on the board). Help them think of things that help the seed grow into a large tree, such as water, soil, and sunlight. Help them see that these are like the things we do to grow closer to God throughout our lives—building our faith in Jesus Christ, repenting each day, living our baptismal covenants, and listening to the Holy Ghost.\nShare with the children the story about the firecracker from Elder Dale G. Renlund’s message “\nHow Can Repenting Help Me Feel Happy?\n” (\nFriend\n, Dec. 2017, 12–13, or\nLiahona\n, Dec. 2017, 70–71; see also the video “Repentance: A Joyful Choice” [Gospel Library]).\nRepentance: A Joyful Choice\nAt various points during the story, invite the children to think about how Elder Renlund might have felt. Why do we feel joy when we repent? Share with the children the joy and love you have felt when you have asked Heavenly Father to forgive you.\nBaptism\nJesus Christ set an example for me when He was baptized.\nEven though Jesus was without sin, He was baptized to set a perfect example of obedience to Heavenly Father (see\n2 Nephi 31:6–10\n).\nTo learn more about baptism, see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n; Gospel Topics, “\nBaptism\n,” Gospel Library.\nPossible Activities\nShow a picture of the Savior’s baptism and another person’s baptism (or see\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n35\nand either no.\n103\nor no.\n104\n). Ask the children to share what is different and what is the same between the two pictures. Read together\nMatthew 3:13–17\nor “\nChapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized\n” in\nNew Testament Stories\n, 26–29, or watch the corresponding video on Gospel Library.\nChapter 10: Jesus Is Baptized\nLet the children point to things in the pictures that are mentioned in the reading or the video. Tell the children about your love for the Savior and your desire to follow Him.\nListen to or sing a song about baptism, such as “\nWhen Jesus Christ Was Baptized\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 102). What do we learn about baptism from the song? Read\n2 Nephi 31:9–10\n, and invite the children to listen for why Jesus Christ was baptized. Invite them to draw a picture of themselves on their baptism day.\nI can choose to make a covenant with God and be baptized.\nPreparing for baptism means much more than preparing for an event. It means preparing to make a covenant and then keeping that covenant for a lifetime. Ponder how you can help the children understand the covenant they will make with Heavenly Father when they are baptized, which includes the promises He makes to them and the promises they make to Him.\nPossible Activities\nExplain that a covenant is a promise between a person and Heavenly Father. As we strive to keep our promises to God, God promises to bless us. Write on the board\nMy Promises to God\nand\nGod’s Promises to Me\n. Read together\nMosiah 18:10, 13\nand\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:37\n, and help the children make a list of the promises they find under the appropriate headings (see also Dallin H. Oaks, “\nYour Baptism Covenant\n,”\nFriend\n, Feb. 2021, 2–3). Share how Heavenly Father has blessed you as you strive to keep your baptismal covenant.\nShow the children pictures of things Jesus Christ did during His ministry (for some examples, see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n33–49\n). Let the children talk about what Jesus is doing in each picture. Read\nMosiah 18:8–10, 13\n, and invite the children to listen for things they promise to do when they are baptized (see also “\nThe Baptism Covenant\n,”\nFriend\n, Feb. 2019, 7;\nLiahona\n, Feb. 2019, F3). How will these promises influence our actions every day? Invite the children to draw a picture of themselves helping someone the way Jesus would. Or you could make the children a simple badge to wear with the Savior’s name on it.\nWhen we are baptized, we make promises to God and He makes promises to us.\nConfirmation\nWhen I am confirmed, I become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nBecoming a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints brings many blessings, including opportunities for the children to be active participants in God’s work.\nTo learn more about confirmation and the gift of the Holy Ghost, see Gary E. Stevenson, “\nHow Does the Holy Ghost Help You?\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2017, 117–20; Gospel Topics, “\nHoly Ghost\n,” Gospel Library.\nPossible Activities\nInvite someone who was recently baptized and confirmed to come to class and share what it was like to be confirmed. What does it mean to this person to become a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? Help the children think of ways they can keep their baptismal covenant as members of the Church (such as serving others, inviting others to learn more about Jesus, saying prayers in meetings, and so on). Share how doing these things has helped you feel the joy of being a member of Christ’s Church.\nShow a picture of the people at the Waters of Mormon (see\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n76\n), and ask the children to describe what they see in the picture. Tell the story of Alma and his people being baptized there (see\nMosiah 18:1–17\n; “\nChapter 15: Alma Teaches and Baptizes\n,”\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 43–44, or the corresponding video in Gospel Library).\nChapter 15: Alma Teaches and Baptizes\nReview\nMosiah 18:8–9\nand invite the children to do actions to help them remember the things the people were willing to do as members of Christ’s Church. Share an experience when you have witnessed members of the Church serving in these ways.\nWhen I am confirmed, I receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nWhen we are baptized and confirmed, Heavenly Father promises that we “may always have his Spirit to be with [us]” (\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77\n). This wonderful gift from God is called the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nPossible Activities\nRead\nDoctrine and Covenants 33:15\n, and ask the children to listen for the special gift that Heavenly Father gives us when we are baptized and confirmed. To help them learn more about how the gift of the Holy Ghost will help them, review together\nJohn 14:26\n;\nGalatians 5:22–23\n;\n2 Nephi 32:5\n;\n3 Nephi 27:20\n. You could also review the article “\nThe Holy Ghost Is …\n” (\nFriend\n, June 2019, 24–25;\nLiahona\n, June 2019, F12–F13).\nBefore class, ask the parents of one or more of the children to share how they have been blessed because they have the gift of the Holy Ghost. How does He help them? How do they hear His voice?\nSing together a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “\nThe Holy Ghost\n” (\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 105). Help the children understand what the song teaches us about how the Holy Ghost can help us.\nThe Holy Ghost can speak to me in many ways.\nChildren who can recognize the voice of the Spirit will be prepared to receive personal revelation to guide them throughout their lives. Teach them that there are many ways the Holy Ghost can speak to us.\nPossible Activities\nHelp the children think of different ways we could talk to a friend who lives far away, such as writing a letter, sending an email, or talking on the phone. Teach them that Heavenly Father can speak to us through the Holy Ghost. Use President Dallin H. Oaks’s message “\nHow Does Heavenly Father Speak to Us?\n” to help the children understand the different ways the Holy Ghost can speak to our minds and hearts (\nFriend\n, Mar. 2020, 2–3;\nLiahona\n, Mar. 2020, F2–F3).\nShare an experience when the Holy Ghost communicated with you, either through thoughts in your mind or through a feeling in your heart (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 6:22–23\n;\n8:2–3\n; see also Henry B. Eyring, “\nOpen Your Heart to the Holy Ghost\n,”\nFriend\n, Aug. 2019, 2–3;\nLiahona\n, Aug. 2019, F2–F3). Testify to the children that the Holy Ghost can help them in similar ways.\nHelp the children think of times they may have felt the Spirit—for example, when singing a song about the Savior or when doing something kind for others. Help them recognize the spiritual feelings that the Holy Ghost brings. Why do you think the Holy Ghost gives us these feelings? Help the children think of things that we need to do to hear the Holy Ghost speak to us. Talk about what you do to hear the Spirit more clearly.\nThe Sacrament\nWhen I take the sacrament, I remember the Savior’s sacrifice and renew my covenants.\nThe Savior gave us the sacrament to help us remember His sacrifice for us and renew our covenants. Because of this weekly ordinance, we can continue to enjoy the blessings of our baptism throughout our lives.\nTo learn more, see\nMatthew 26:26–30\n;\n3 Nephi 18:1–12\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n.\nPossible Activities\nInvite the children to color “\nJesus Introduced the Sacrament to the Nephites\n” in\nScripture Stories Coloring Book: Book of Mormon\n(2019), 26. Ask them to point to what the people are thinking about in the picture. Read to the children portions of\n3 Nephi 18:1–12\nor “\nChapter 45: Jesus Christ Teaches about the Sacrament and Prayer\n,”\nBook of Mormon Stories\n, 126–27, or watch the corresponding video on Gospel Library. What can we do to remember Jesus Christ during the sacrament?\nChapter 45: Jesus Christ Teaches About The Sacrament And Prayer\nAsk the children to tell you some things they should always remember to do, such as tying their shoes or washing their hands before they eat. Why is it important to remember these things? Read\nMoroni 4:3\nto the children, and invite them to listen for what we promise to always remember when we take the sacrament. Why is it important to remember Jesus Christ? Help the children understand how the bread and water of the sacrament help us remember what Jesus has done for us (see\nMoroni 4:3\n;\n5:2\n).\nWrite on the board “I promise to …” Read the sacrament prayers to the children (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n). When they hear a promise we make to God, pause and help them complete the sentence on the board with the promise they heard. Help them understand that when we take the sacrament, we are making the same promises we made at baptism.\nWhat does it mean to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ? To help the children answer this question, share an example of something that we put our names on. Why do we put our names on these things? Why would Jesus Christ want to put His name upon us? Consider sharing this explanation from President Russell M. Nelson: “Taking the Savior’s name upon us includes declaring and witnessing to others—through our actions and our words—that Jesus is the Christ” (“\nThe Correct Name of the Church\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2018, 88).\nPriesthood Power, Authority, and Keys\nGod blesses His children through priesthood power.\nAll of God’s children—female and male, young and old—receive God’s power as they keep the covenants they have made with Him. We make these covenants when we receive priesthood ordinances such as baptism (see\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n3.5\n, Gospel Library). To learn more, see Russell M. Nelson, “\nSpiritual Treasures\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 76–79; “\nPriesthood Principles\n,” chapter 3 in\nGeneral Handbook\n.\nPossible Activities\nHelp the children notice the blessings they receive because of the priesthood. To give them some ideas, you could show the video “Blessings of the Priesthood” (Gospel Library).\nBlessings of the Priesthood\nConsider listing these blessings on the board. Why are these blessings important to us? Testify that these blessings come to us because of Jesus Christ and His priesthood power.\nWrite the following headings on the board:\nGod’s power\nand\nGod’s power and authority given to men on earth\n. Ask the children to place pictures under the first heading that help us understand how God has used His power to bless us, such as by creating the world, guiding and directing us, showing us that He loves and knows us, and hearing and answering our prayers (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n3\n,\n68\n,\n90\n,\n111\n). Ask them to place pictures under the second heading that help us understand how worthy men on earth use God’s power and authority to bless us, such as by blessing the sick, baptizing, confirming, administering the sacrament, and sealing families (see\nGospel Art Book\n, nos.\n46\n,\n104\n,\n105\n,\n107\n,\n120\n). Share why you are grateful for the priesthood and the blessings it brings.\nOne of the main ways we receive the blessings of God’s power in our lives is through priesthood ordinances (see\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:20\n). To help the children learn this truth, you could list the following scriptures on the board:\n3 Nephi 11:21–26, 33\n(baptism);\nMoroni 2\n(confirmation);\nMoroni 4–5\n(sacrament). The children could each choose one of these passages and identify the ordinance it describes. Invite the children to share how they have been personally blessed by receiving priesthood ordinances.\nHelp the children understand that they will receive power from God as they are baptized and keep their baptismal covenant. Ask the children how this power could help them.\nGod’s work is directed by priesthood keys and accomplished by priesthood authority.\nWorthy male Church members can be ordained to an office in the priesthood. In addition, whenever a person is set apart for a calling or assigned to help in God’s work, they can exercise delegated priesthood authority. The use of all priesthood authority in the Church is directed by individuals who hold priesthood keys, such as the stake president, the bishop, and quorum presidents. Priesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood in doing the work of the Lord.\nPossible Activities\nRead with the children\nMark 3:14–15\n, and show them a picture of the event described there (such as\nGospel Art Book\n, no.\n38\n). Ask the children if they have ever seen someone be ordained to a priesthood office or get set apart for a calling (or tell them about experiences you have had). How is that similar to what the Savior did with His Apostles? Help the children list on the board priesthood offices or callings that can be given to members of the Church, such as a teacher or leader in an organization. Next to each office or calling, you could write what someone with that office or calling has the authority to do. Tell the children how being set apart by someone with the direction of priesthood keys has helped you serve.\nInvite the children to think of something that you need a key for, such as a car or a door. What happens if you don’t have the key? Read together\nDoctrine and Covenants 65:2\n, and share your testimony about the importance of having priesthood keys. You could also watch the video “Where Are the Keys?” (Gospel Library) and look for what Elder Stevenson teaches about priesthood keys.\nWhere Are the Keys?\nAsk someone in the ward who holds keys to come to class and share with the children what it means to hold priesthood keys. Invite him to describe his responsibilities. What parts of the Lord’s work does he lead? How does the Savior help him?\nThe Temple and the Plan of Happiness\nThe temple is the house of the Lord.\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children. In temples, we make sacred covenants with Him, are endowed with priesthood power, receive revelation, perform ordinances for our deceased ancestors, and are sealed to our families for eternity. All of this is possible because of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.\nHow can you help the children you teach recognize the sacredness of the Lord’s house and prepare themselves to be worthy to participate in temple ordinances? Consider reviewing these resources:\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:15–17\n; Russell M. Nelson, “\nClosing Remarks\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, Nov. 2019, 120–22; “\nWhy Latter-day Saints Build Temples\n,” temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\nTemples are a part of Heavenly Father’s plan for His children.\nPossible Activities\nDisplay one or more pictures of temples. Ask the children what makes the temple a special place. Point out that on each temple is this inscription: “Holiness to the Lord: The House of the Lord.” Ask the children what they think “Holiness to the Lord” might mean. Why is the temple called the house of the Lord? What does this teach us about the temple? If any of the children have been to a temple, they could also share how they felt when they were there. If you have been to the temple, share how you have felt the Lord’s presence there, and talk about why the temple is a sacred place to you.\nRead together\nDoctrine and Covenants 97:15–17\n. Ask the children to look for what the Lord expects of people who enter His holy house. Why do we need to be worthy to enter His house? As part of this conversation, talk to the children about temple recommends, including how to receive one. You could invite a member of the bishopric to share with them what a temple recommend interview is like and the questions that are asked in one.\nIn the temple, we make covenants with God.\nPresident Russell M. Nelson taught, “Jesus Christ invites us to take the covenant path back home to our Heavenly Parents and be with those we love” (“\nCome, Follow Me\n,”\nEnsign\nor\nLiahona\n, May 2019, 91). Help the children understand that the covenant path includes baptism, confirmation, and the temple endowment and sealing.\nPossible Activities\nAsk the children to help you review the covenant that we make with God when we are baptized and that we renew when we partake of the sacrament (see\nMosiah 18:10\n;\nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79\n). Show a picture of the temple and explain that Heavenly Father has more blessings He wants to give us in the temple.\nDraw a gate leading to a path. Ask the children why they think it is helpful to have a path to walk on. Read together\n2 Nephi 31:17–20\n, where Nephi compares the covenant of baptism to a gate and invites us to continue on the path after baptism. There are more covenants to make after baptism, including covenants made in the temple. Explain that President Nelson has called this path the “covenant path.”\nIn the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed for ancestors who have died.\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for all of God’s children to return to live with Him, even if they die without knowing the gospel. In the temple, we can be baptized and confirmed members of the Church of Jesus Christ on their behalf.\nPossible Activities\nTalk about a time when someone did something for you that you could not do for yourself. Invite the children to share similar experiences. Explain that when we go to the temple, we can receive sacred ordinances such as baptism for others who have died. How are we being like Jesus when we are doing work for the dead? What has He done for us that we couldn’t do for ourselves?\nInvite one or more youth who have been baptized for their ancestors to share their experience. Ask them what it was like in the temple. Encourage them to share how they felt doing this work for their ancestors.\nDraw a tree on the board, including the roots and branches. Ask the children to think of how a family is like a tree. Label the roots\nAncestors\n, label the branches\nDescendants\n, and label the trunk of the tree\nYou\n. Read together this sentence from\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\n: “For we without them [our ancestors] cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.” Ask questions like the following: “Why do we need our ancestors? Why do our descendants need us? How have our parents, grandparents, and other ancestors helped us?” Invite the children to search the rest of\nDoctrine and Covenants 128:18\nfor a phrase that describes how we can help our ancestors.\nConsider working with the parents of each child to find an ancestor’s name for the child to take to the temple (see\nFamilySearch.org\n)."

        "The presentation should allow the children to present what they and their families have learned from the Book of Mormon at home and in Primary, including the Primary songs they have sung during the year. As you plan the presentation, think of ways it can help the congregation focus on the Savior and His teachings.",
        "Units with small numbers of children may consider ways in which family members can participate with their children. A member of the bishopric may conclude the meeting with brief remarks.",
        "As you prepare the presentation, remember the following guidelines:",
        "See General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , 12.2.1.2 .",
        "5 minutes (Primary presidency): Opening prayer, scripture or article of faith, and one talk",
        "20 minutes (music leader): Singing time",
        "The Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. A list of songs that reinforce these principles is included in this guide.",
        "As you teach songs to the children, invite them to share what they have already learned about the stories and doctrinal principles the songs teach. Invite the children to share their thoughts and feelings about the truths found in the songs.",
        "The Children’s Songbook is the basic resource for music in Primary. Hymns from the hymnbook and songs from the Friend are also appropriate. The use of any other music in Primary must be approved by the bishopric (see General Handbook , 12.3.4 ).",
        "Singing time is intended to help the children learn the truths of the gospel. The following ideas can inspire you as you plan ways to teach the gospel principles found in hymns and Primary songs.",
        "Read related scriptures. For many of the songs in the Children’s Songbook and the hymnbook, references to related scriptures are listed. Help the children read some of these passages, and talk about how the scriptures are related to the song. You could also list a few scripture references on the board and invite the children to match each reference to a song or a verse from a song.",
        "Fill in the blank. Write a verse of the song on the board with several key words missing. Then ask the children to sing the song, listening for the words that fill in the blanks. As they fill in each blank, discuss what gospel principles you learn from the missing words.",
        "Testify. Bear brief testimony to the children of gospel truths found in the Primary song. Help the children understand that singing is one way they can bear testimony and feel the Spirit.",
        "Stand as a witness. Invite children to take turns standing and sharing what they learn from the song they are singing or how they feel about the truths taught in the song. Ask them how they feel as they sing the song, and help them identify the influence of the Holy Ghost.",
        "Use pictures. Ask the children to help you find or create pictures that go with important words or phrases in the song. Invite them to share how the pictures relate to the song and what the song teaches. For example, if you are teaching the song “ The Iron Rod ” ( Hymns , no. 274), you could put pictures throughout the room or under chairs depicting important words from the song (such as iron rod , word of God , guide , temptation , and heaven ). Ask the children to gather the pictures and hold them up in the correct order as you sing the song together.",
        "Share an object lesson. You could use an object to inspire discussion about a song. For example, the song “ Faith ” ( Children’s Songbook , 96–97) mentions a little seed. You could show the children a seed and talk about how we show faith when we plant a seed; this could lead to a discussion about ways we show faith in Jesus Christ, as described in the song.",
        "Invite sharing of personal experiences. Help the children connect the principles taught in the song with experiences they have had with these principles. For example, before singing “ I Love to See the Temple ” ( Children’s Songbook , 95), you could ask the children to raise their hands if they have seen a temple. Invite them, as they sing, to think about how they feel when they see a temple.",
        "Ask questions. There are many questions you can ask as you sing songs. For example, you can ask the children what they learn from each verse in the song. You can also ask them to think of questions that the song answers. This can lead to a discussion about the truths taught in the song.",
        "Use simple hand actions. Invite the children to think of simple hand actions to help them remember the words and messages of a song. For example, when you sing the second verse of “ My Heavenly Father Loves Me ” ( Children’s Songbook , 228–29), you could invite the children to point to their eyes, act like butterflies, and cup their hands behind their ears. Ask them to place their hands on their hearts as they sing “Yes, I know Heavenly Father loves me.”"

As children sing about gospel principles, the Holy Ghost will testify of their truthfulness. The words and music will stay in the children’s minds and hearts throughout their lives.\nSeek the help of the Spirit as you prepare to teach the gospel through music. Share your testimony of the truths you sing about. Help the children see how the music relates to what they are learning and experiencing at home and in Primary classes.\nGuidelines for the Sacrament Meeting Presentation\nWith the direction of the bishop, the children’s sacrament meeting presentation is normally held during the fourth quarter of the year. As the Primary presidency and music leader, work with the counselor in the bishopric who oversees Primary to plan the presentation.\nThe presentation should allow the children to present what they and their families have learned from the Book of Mormon at home and in Primary, including the Primary songs they have sung during the year. As you plan the presentation, think of ways it can help the congregation focus on the Savior and His teachings.\nUnits with small numbers of children may consider ways in which family members can participate with their children. A member of the bishopric may conclude the meeting with brief remarks.\nAs you prepare the presentation, remember the following guidelines:\nPractices should not take unnecessary time away from Primary classes or families.\nVisuals, costumes, and media presentations are not appropriate for sacrament meeting.\nSee\nGeneral Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n,\n12.2.1.2\n.\nInstructions for Singing Time\n5 minutes (Primary presidency): Opening prayer, scripture or article of faith, and one talk\n20 minutes (music leader): Singing time\nThe Primary presidency and music leader select songs for each month to reinforce principles the children are learning in their classes and at home. A list of songs that reinforce these principles is included in this guide.\nAs you teach songs to the children, invite them to share what they have already learned about the stories and doctrinal principles the songs teach. Invite the children to share their thoughts and feelings about the truths found in the songs.\nThe\nChildren’s Songbook\nis the basic resource for music in Primary. Hymns from the hymnbook and songs from the\nFriend\nare also appropriate. The use of any other music in Primary must be approved by the bishopric (see\nGeneral Handbook\n,\n12.3.4\n).\nMusic for Singing Time\nJanuary\n“\nBook of Mormon Stories\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 118–19\n“\nKeep the Commandments\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 146–47\n“\nThe Iron Rod\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 274\nFebruary\n“\nNephi’s Courage\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 120–21\n“\nI Feel My Savior’s Love\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 74–75\n“\nChoose the Right\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 239\nMarch\n“\nI Love to See the Temple\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 95\n“\nWhen I Am Baptized\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 103\n“\nEaster Hosanna\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 68–69\nApril\n“\nA Child’s Prayer\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 12–13\n“\nHave I Done Any Good?\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 223\nMay\n“\nLove One Another\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 136–37\n“\nI Will Be Valiant\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 162\n“\nHelp Me, Dear Father\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 99\nJune\n“\nTestimony\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 137\n“\nWe’ll Bring the World His Truth\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 172–73\n“\nFollow the Prophet\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 110–11\nJuly\n“\nI Want to Be a Missionary Now\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 168\n“\nMy Heavenly Father Loves Me\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 228–29\n“\nFaith\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 96–97\nAugust\n“\nAs I Search the Holy Scriptures\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 277\n“\nHome Can Be a Heaven on Earth\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 298\nSeptember\n“\nThe Still Small Voice\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 106–7\n“\nSamuel Tells of the Baby Jesus\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 36\n“\nI’m Trying to Be like Jesus\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 78–79\nOctober\n“\nFamilies Can Be Together Forever\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 188\n“\nThe Church of Jesus Christ\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 77\nNovember\n“\nDare to Do Right\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 158\n“\nI Believe in Christ\n,”\nHymns\n, no. 134\nDecember\n“\nSearch, Ponder, and Pray\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 109\n“\nAway in a Manger\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 42–43\n“\nHe Sent His Son\n,”\nChildren’s Songbook\n, 34–35\nUsing Music to Teach Doctrine\nSinging time is intended to help the children learn the truths of the gospel.
