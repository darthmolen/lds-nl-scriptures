2 CHRONICLES 36:22–EZRA 1:9 634



the mouth of Jeremiah, until the
land had enjoyed her sabbaths: _for_
as long as she lay desolate she kept
_**a**_ sabbath, to fulfil _**b**_ threescore and
ten years.
22 ¶ Now in the first year of Cyrus
king of Persia, that the word of the
LORD _spoken_ by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the
LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus
king of Persia, that he made a



proclamation throughout all his
kingdom, and _put it_ also in writing, saying,
23 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia,
All the kingdoms of the earth hath
the LORD God of heaven given me;
and he hath charged me to build
him an _**[a ]**_ house in Jerusalem, which
_is_ in Judah. Who _is there_ among you
of all his people? The LORD his God
_be_ with him, and let him go up.

|4 Then said we unto them after<br>this manner, What are the names of<br>the men that make this building?<br>5 But the eye of their God was<br>upon the elders of the Jews, that<br>they could not cause them to cease,<br>till the matter came to Darius: and<br>then they returned answer by letter<br>concerning this matter.<br>6 ¶ The copy of the letter that Tat-<br>nai, governor on this side the river,<br>and Shethar-boznai, and his com-<br>panions the Apharsachites, which<br>were on this side the river, sent unto<br>Darius the king:<br>7 They sent a letter unto him,<br>wherein was written thus; Unto<br>Darius the king, all peace.<br>8 Be it known unto the a king, that<br>we went into the province of Ju-<br>dea, to the house of the great God,<br>which is builded with great stones,<br>and timber is laid in the walls, and<br>this work goeth fast on, and pros-<br>pereth in their hands.<br>9 Then asked we those elders, and<br>said unto them thus, Who com-<br>manded you to build this house,<br>and to make up these walls?<br>10 We asked their names also, to<br>certify thee, that we might write<br>the names of the men that were the<br>chief of them.<br>11 And thus they returned us an-<br>swer, saying, We are the servants of<br>the God of heaven and earth, and<br>build the house that was builded<br>these many years ago, which a great<br>king of Israel builded and set up.<br>12 But after that our fathers had<br>provoked the God of heaven unto<br>wrath, he gave them into the hand<br>of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Bab-<br>ylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed<br>this house, and carried the people<br>away into Babylon.<br>13 But in the first year of Cyrus<br>the king of Babylon the same king<br>a Cyrus made a decree to build this<br>house of God.<br>14 And the vessels also of gold and<br>silver of the house of God, which<br>Nebuchadnezzar took out of the|Col2|temple that was in Jerusalem, and<br>brought them into the temple of<br>Babylon, those did Cyrus the king<br>take out of the temple of Babylon,<br>and they were delivered unto one,<br>whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom<br>he had made governor;<br>15 And said unto him, Take these<br>vessels, go, carry them into the temple<br>that is in Jerusalem, and let the house<br>of God be builded in his place.<br>16 Then came the same Sheshbaz-<br>zar, and laid the foundation of the<br>house of God which is in Jerusalem:<br>and since that time even until now<br>hath it been in building, and yet it<br>is not finished.<br>17 Now therefore, if it seem good to<br>the king, let there be search made<br>in the king’s treasure house, which<br>is there at Babylon, whether it be<br>so, that a decree was made of Cyrus<br>the king to build this house of God<br>at Jerusalem, and let the king send<br>his pleasure to us concerning this<br>matter.<br>CHAPTER 6<br>Darius renews the decree of Cyrus to<br>build the temple—It is finished and<br>dedicated, and sacrifices and feasts<br>commence again.<br>THEN Darius the king made a decree,<br>and search was made in the house<br>of the a rolls, where the treasures<br>were laid up in Babylon.<br>2 And there was found at Achmetha,<br>in the palace that is in the province<br>of the Medes, a a roll, and therein<br>was a record thus written:<br>3 In the first year of Cyrus the king<br>the same Cyrus the king made a de-<br>cree concerning the house of God at<br>Jerusalem, Let the a house be builded,<br>the place where they offered sacri-<br>fices, and let the foundations thereof<br>be strongly laid; the height thereof<br>threescore cubits, and the breadth<br>thereof threescore cubits;<br>4 With three rows of great stones,<br>and a row of new timber: and let<br>the expenses be given out of the<br>king’s house:|Col4|

|the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem,<br>in the chambers of the house of<br>the LORD.<br>30 So took the priests and the Lev-<br>ites the weight of the silver, and the<br>gold, and the vessels, to bring them to<br>Jerusalem unto the house of our God.<br>31 ¶ Then we departed from the<br>river of Ahava on the twelfth day<br>of the first month, to go unto Je-<br>rusalem: and the hand of our God<br>was upon us, and he delivered us<br>from the hand of the enemy, and<br>of such as lay in wait by the way.<br>32 And we came to Jerusalem, and<br>abode there three days.<br>33 ¶ Now on the fourth day was the<br>silver and the gold and the vessels<br>weighed in the house of our God<br>by the hand of Meremoth the son<br>of Uriah the priest; and with him<br>was Eleazar the son of Phinehas;<br>and with them was Jozabad the son<br>of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of<br>Binnui, Levites;<br>34 By number and by weight of<br>every one: and all the weight was<br>written at that time.<br>35 Also the children of those that<br>had been carried away, which were<br>come out of the captivity, offered<br>burnt offerings unto the God of Is-<br>rael, twelve bullocks for all Israel,<br>ninety and six rams, seventy and<br>seven lambs, twelve he goats for a<br>sin offering: all this was a burnt of-<br>fering unto the LORD.<br>36 ¶ And they delivered the king’s<br>commissions unto the king’s lieuten-<br>ants, and to the governors a on this<br>side the river: and they b furthered<br>the people, and the house of God.<br>CHAPTER 9<br>Many Jews intermarry with the Ca-<br>naanites and others and follow their<br>abominations—Ezra prays and con-<br>fesses the sins of all the people.<br>NOW when these things were done,|Col2|the a princes came to me, saying, The<br>people of Israel, and the priests,<br>and the Levites, have not b sepa-<br>rated themselves from the people<br>of the lands, doing according to<br>their c abominations, even of the<br>Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizz-<br>ites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites,<br>the Moabites, the Egyptians, and<br>the Amorites.<br>2 For they have taken of their<br>a daughters for themselves, and for<br>their sons: so that the b holy seed<br>have mingled themselves with the<br>people of those lands: yea, the hand<br>of the princes and rulers hath been<br>chief in this trespass.<br>3 And when I heard this thing, I<br>a rent my garment and my mantle,<br>and plucked off the hair of my head<br>and of my beard, and sat down as-<br>tonied.<br>4 Then were assembled unto me<br>every one that a trembled at the<br>words of the God of Israel, because<br>of the transgression of those that<br>had been carried away; and I sat<br>astonied until the evening sacrifice.<br>5 ¶ And at the evening sacrifice I<br>arose up from my heaviness; and hav-<br>ing rent my garment and my mantle,<br>I fell upon my knees, and spread out<br>my hands unto the LORD my God,<br>6 And said, O my God, I am ashamed<br>and blush to lift up my face to thee,<br>my God: for our iniquities are in-<br>creased over our head, and our tres-<br>pass is grown up unto the heavens.<br>7 Since the days of our fathers have<br>we been in a great trespass unto this<br>day; and for our iniquities have we,<br>our kings, and our priests, been de-<br>livered into the hand of the kings of<br>the lands, to the sword, to captivity,<br>and to a spoil, and to a confusion of<br>face, as it is this day.<br>8 And now for a little space a grace<br>hath been shewed from the LORD our<br>God, to leave us a remnant to escape,<br>and to give us a b nail in his holy|Col4|
