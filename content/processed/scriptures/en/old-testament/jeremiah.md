THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET
JEREMIAH












|CHAPTER 1<br>Jeremiah was foreordained to be a<br>prophet unto the nations—He is called as<br>a mortal to declare the word of the Lord.<br>T<br>HE words of Jeremiah the son<br>of Hilkiah, of the priests that<br>were in aA nathoth in the land<br>of Benjamin:<br>2 To whom the word of the LORD<br>came in the days of Josiah the son<br>of Amon king of Judah, in the thir-<br>teenth a year of his reign.<br>3 It came also in the days of Je-<br>hoiakim the son of Josiah king of<br>Judah, unto the end of the eleventh<br>year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah<br>king of Judah, unto the a carrying<br>away of Jerusalem captive in the<br>fifth month.<br>4 Then the word of the LORD came<br>unto me, saying,<br>5 Before I a formed thee in the belly<br>I b knew thee; and before thou cam-<br>est forth out of the womb I c sanc-<br>tified thee, and I d ordained thee a<br>prophet unto the e nations.<br>6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! be-<br>hold, I cannot a speak: for I am a<br>b child.<br>7 ¶ But the LORD said unto me,<br>Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt<br>go to all that I shall a send thee, and|Col2|whatsoever I b command thee thou<br>shalt c speak.<br>8 Be not a afraid of their faces: for<br>I am with thee to deliver thee, saith<br>the LORD.<br>9 Then the LORD put forth his<br>hand, and touched my a mouth. And<br>the LORD said unto me, Behold, I<br>have put my b words in thy c mouth.<br>10 See, I have this day a set thee over<br>the nations and over the kingdoms,<br>to root out, and to b pull down, and<br>to destroy, and to c throw down, to<br>d build, and to plant.<br>11 ¶ Moreover the word of the LORD<br>came unto me, saying, Jeremiah,<br>what a seest thou? And I said, I see<br>a rod of an almond tree.<br>12 Then said the LORD unto me,<br>Thou hast well seen: for I will has-<br>ten my word to perform it.<br>13 And the word of the LORD came<br>unto me the second time, saying,<br>What seest thou? And I said, I see a<br>a seething b pot; and the face thereof<br>is toward the north.<br>14 Then the LORD said unto me,<br>Out of the a north an evil shall break<br>forth upon all the inhabitants of<br>the land.<br>15 For, lo, I will call all the families<br>of the kingdoms of the north, saith<br>the LORD; and they shall come, and|Col4|

|11 ¶ When Michaiah the son of<br>Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had<br>heard out of the book all the words<br>of the LORD,<br>12 Then he went down into the<br>king’s house, into the scribe’s cham-<br>ber: and, lo, all the a princes sat there,<br>even Elishama the scribe, and Del-<br>aiah the son of Shemaiah, and b El-<br>nathan the son of Achbor, and<br>Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and<br>Zedekiah the son of Hananiah,<br>and all the princes.<br>13 Then Michaiah declared unto<br>them all the words that he had<br>heard, when Baruch read the book<br>in the ears of the people.<br>14 Therefore all the princes sent<br>Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the<br>son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi,<br>unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine<br>hand the roll wherein thou hast<br>read in the ears of the people, and<br>come.

|16 ¶ When Jeremiah was entered<br>into the dungeon, and into the a cab-<br>ins, and Jeremiah had remained<br>there many days;<br>17 Then Zedekiah the king sent,<br>and took him out: and the king asked<br>him secretly in his house, and said,<br>Is there any word from the LORD?<br>And Jeremiah said, There is: for,<br>said he, thou shalt be delivered into<br>the hand of the king of Babylon.<br>18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto<br>king Zedekiah, What have I offended<br>against thee, or against thy servants,<br>or against this people, that ye have<br>put me in prison?<br>19 Where are now your prophets<br>which prophesied unto you, saying,<br>The king of Babylon shall not come<br>against you, nor against this land?<br>20 Therefore hear now, I pray thee,<br>O my lord the king: let my suppli-<br>cation, I pray thee, be accepted be-<br>fore thee; that thou cause me not<br>to return to the house of Jonathan<br>the scribe, lest I die there.<br>21 Then Zedekiah the king com-<br>manded that they should commit<br>Jeremiah into the court of the<br>prison, and that they should give<br>him daily a piece of a bread out of<br>the bakers’ street, until all the bread<br>in the city were spent. Thus Jere-<br>miah remained in the court of the<br>prison.<br>CHAPTER 38<br>The rulers cast Jeremiah into a muddy<br>dungeon—He is freed by Ebed-melech,<br>an Ethiopian, and put in the court of<br>the prison—Jeremiah counsels Zedekiah<br>concerning the war.<br>THEN Shephatiah the son of Mattan,<br>and Gedaliah the son of a Pashur,<br>and Jucal the son of Shelemiah,<br>and b Pashur the son of Malchiah,<br>heard the words that Jeremiah had<br>spoken unto all the people, saying,<br>2 Thus saith the LORD, He that|Col2|remaineth in this city shall die by<br>the sword, by the famine, and by the<br>pestilence: but he that goeth forth<br>to the Chaldeans shall live; for he<br>shall have his life for a prey, and<br>shall live.<br>3 Thus saith the LORD, This city<br>shall surely be given into the hand<br>of the king of a Babylon’s army,<br>which shall take it.<br>4 Therefore the a princes said unto<br>the king, We beseech thee, let this<br>man be put to death: for thus he<br>weakeneth the hands of the men<br>of war that remain in this city,<br>and the hands of all the people, in<br>speaking such words unto them: for<br>this man seeketh not the b welfare<br>of this people, but the hurt.<br>5 Then Zedekiah the king said,<br>Behold, he is in your hand: for the<br>king a is not he that can do any thing<br>against you.<br>6 Then took they Jeremiah, and<br>cast him into the dungeon of Mal-<br>chiah the son of a Hammelech, that<br>was in the court of the prison: and<br>they let down Jeremiah with cords.<br>And in the dungeon there was no<br>water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk<br>in the mire.<br>7 ¶ Now when Ebed-melech the<br>Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which<br>was in the king’s house, heard that<br>they had put Jeremiah in the dun-<br>geon; the king then sitting in the<br>gate of Benjamin;<br>8 Ebed-melech went forth out of<br>the king’s house, and spake to the<br>king, saying,<br>9 My lord the king, these men have<br>done evil in all that they have done<br>to Jeremiah the prophet, whom<br>they have cast into the dungeon;<br>and he is like to die for hunger in<br>the place where he is: for there is<br>no more a bread in the city.<br>10 Then the king commanded<br>Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,<br>Take from hence thirty men with|Col4|

And Jeremiah did so.<br>13 So they drew up Jeremiah with<br>cords, and took him up out of the<br>dungeon: and Jeremiah remained<br>in the court of the prison.<br>14 ¶ Then Zedekiah the king sent,<br>and took Jeremiah the prophet unto<br>him into the third entry that is in<br>the house of the LORD: and the king<br>said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee<br>a thing; hide nothing from me.<br>15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zede-<br>kiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt<br>thou not surely put me to death?<br>and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou<br>not hearken unto me?<br>16 So Zedekiah the king sware se-<br>cretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the<br>LORD liveth, that made us this soul,<br>I will not put thee to death, neither<br>will I give thee into the hand of<br>these men that seek thy life.<br>17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zede-<br>kiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God<br>of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou<br>wilt assuredly go forth unto the<br>king of Babylon’s princes, then thy<br>soul shall live, and this city shall<br>not be burned with fire; and thou<br>shalt live, and thine house:<br>18 But if thou wilt not go forth to<br>the king of Babylon’s princes, then<br>shall this city be given into the<br>hand of the Chaldeans, and they<br>shall burn it with fire, and thou<br>shalt not escape out of their hand.<br>19 And Zedekiah the king said unto<br>Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews|Col2|that a are fallen to the Chaldeans,<br>lest they deliver me into their hand,<br>and they b mock me.<br>20 But Jeremiah said, They shall<br>not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech<br>thee, the voice of the LORD, which<br>I speak unto thee: so it shall be well<br>unto thee, and thy soul shall live.<br>21 But if thou refuse to go forth,<br>this is the word that the LORD hath<br>shewed me:<br>22 And, behold, all the women that<br>are left in the king of Judah’s house<br>shall be brought forth to the king of<br>Babylon’s princes, and those women<br>shall say, Thy friends have set thee<br>on, and have prevailed against thee:<br>thy feet are sunk in the mire, and<br>they are turned away back.<br>23 So they shall bring out all thy<br>wives and thy a children to the Chal-<br>deans: and thou shalt not escape out<br>of their hand, but shalt be taken by<br>the hand of the king of Babylon:<br>and thou shalt cause this city to be<br>burned with fire.<br>24 ¶ Then said Zedekiah unto Jere-<br>miah, Let no man know of these<br>words, and thou shalt not die.<br>25 But if the princes hear that I<br>have talked with thee, and they<br>come unto thee, and say unto thee,<br>Declare unto us now what thou hast<br>said unto the king, hide it not from<br>us, and we will not put thee to death;<br>also what the king said unto thee:<br>26 Then thou shalt say unto them,<br>I presented my supplication before<br>the king, that he would not cause<br>me to return to Jonathan’s house,<br>to die there.<br>27 Then came all the princes unto<br>Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told<br>them according to all these words<br>that the king had commanded.

So the captain of the guard|Col2|gave him b victuals and a reward,<br>and let him go.<br>6 Then went Jeremiah unto Geda-<br>liah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;<br>and dwelt with him among the<br>people that were left in the land.<br>7 ¶ Now when all the captains of<br>the forces which were in the fields,<br>even they and their men, heard that<br>the king of Babylon had made Geda-<br>liah the son of Ahikam governor<br>in the land, and had committed<br>unto him men, and women, and<br>children, and of the a poor of the<br>land, of them that were not carried<br>away captive to Babylon;<br>8 Then they came to Gedaliah to<br>Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of<br>Nethaniah, and aJ ohanan and Jona-<br>than the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah<br>the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons<br>of Ephai the Netophathite, and<br>Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite,<br>they and their men.<br>9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam<br>the son of Shaphan sware unto them<br>and to their men, saying, Fear not<br>to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the<br>land, and serve the king of Babylon,<br>and it shall be well with you.<br>10 As for me, behold, I will dwell<br>at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans,<br>which will come unto us: but ye,<br>gather ye wine, and summer fruits,<br>and oil, and put them in your ves-<br>sels, and dwell in your cities that<br>ye have taken.<br>11 Likewise when all the Jews that<br>were in Moab, and among the Am-<br>monites, and in Edom, and that were<br>in all the countries, heard that the<br>king of Babylon had left a remnant<br>of Judah, and that he had set over<br>them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam<br>the son of Shaphan;<br>12 Even all the Jews returned out<br>of all places whither they were<br>driven, and came to the land of Ju-<br>dah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and<br>gathered wine and summer fruits<br>very much.<br>13 ¶ Moreover Johanan the son of|Col4|

Also thou<br>shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the<br>sword shall pursue thee.<br>3 A voice of crying shall be from<br>a Horonaim, spoiling and great de-<br>struction.<br>4 a Moab is destroyed; her little<br>ones have caused a cry to be heard.<br>5 For in the going up of Luhith con-<br>tinual weeping shall go up; for in the<br>going down of Horonaim the enemies<br>have heard a cry of destruction.<br>6 Flee, save your lives, and be like<br>the a heath in the wilderness.<br>7 ¶ For because thou hast trusted<br>in thy a works and in thy treasures,<br>thou shalt also be taken: and Che-<br>mosh shall go forth into b captivity<br>with his priests and his princes to-<br>gether.<br>8 And the spoiler shall come upon<br>every city, and no city shall escape:<br>the valley also shall perish, and<br>the plain shall be destroyed, as the<br>LORD hath spoken.<br>9 Give wings unto Moab, that it<br>may flee and get away: for the cities<br>thereof shall be desolate, without<br>any to dwell therein.<br>10 a Cursed be he that doeth the<br>work of the LORD deceitfully, and<br>cursed be he that keepeth back his<br>sword from blood.<br>11 ¶ Moab hath been at ease from<br>his youth, and he hath a settled on<br>his b lees, and hath not been emptied<br>from vessel to vessel, neither hath<br>he gone into captivity: therefore<br>his taste remained in him, and his<br>scent is not changed.<br>12 Therefore, behold, the days<br>come, saith the LORD, that I will<br>send unto him a wanderers, that<br>shall cause him to wander, and shall<br>empty his vessels, and break their<br>bottles.|Col2|13 And Moab shall be a ashamed<br>of Chemosh, as the house of Israel<br>was ashamed of Beth-el their con-<br>fidence.<br>14 ¶ How say ye, We are mighty<br>and strong men for the war?<br>15 Moab is spoiled, and gone up out<br>of her cities, and his chosen young<br>men are gone down to the slaugh-<br>ter, saith the King, whose name is<br>the LORD of hosts.<br>16 The calamity of Moab is near to<br>come, and his affliction hasteth fast.<br>17 All ye that are about him, be-<br>moan him; and all ye that know his<br>name, say, How is the strong staff<br>broken, and the beautiful rod!<br>18 Thou daughter that dost inhabit<br>Dibon, come down from thy glory,<br>and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of<br>Moab shall come upon thee, and<br>he shall destroy thy strong holds.<br>19 O inhabitant of aA roer, stand<br>by the way, and espy; ask him that<br>fleeth, and her that escapeth, and<br>say, What is done?<br>20 Moab is confounded; for it is<br>broken down: a howl and cry; tell<br>ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,<br>21 And judgment is come upon<br>the plain country; upon Holon, and<br>upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,<br>22 And upon Dibon, and upon<br>Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,<br>23 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon<br>Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,<br>24 And upon a Kerioth, and upon<br>b Bozrah, and upon all the cities of<br>the land of Moab, far or near.<br>25 The a horn of Moab is cut off, and<br>his arm is broken, saith the LORD.<br>26 ¶ Make ye him a drunken: for he<br>magnified himself against the LORD:<br>Moab also shall wallow in his vomit,<br>and he also shall be in derision.<br>27 For was not Israel a derision<br>unto thee? was he found among<br>thieves? for since thou spakest of<br>him, thou skippedst for joy.|Col4|

|28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave<br>the cities, and dwell in the rock, and<br>be like the dove that maketh her<br>nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.<br>29 We have heard the a pride of<br>Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his<br>loftiness, and his arrogancy, and<br>his pride, and the haughtiness of<br>his heart.<br>30 I know his wrath, saith the<br>LORD; but it shall not be so; his lies<br>shall not so effect it.<br>31 Therefore will I howl for Moab,<br>and I will cry out for all Moab; mine<br>heart shall mourn for the men of<br>Kir-heres.<br>32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep<br>for thee with the weeping of Jazer:<br>thy a plants are gone over the sea,<br>they reach even to the sea of Jazer:<br>the spoiler is fallen upon thy sum-<br>mer fruits and upon thy vintage.<br>33 And joy and a gladness is taken<br>from the plentiful field, and from<br>the land of Moab; and I have caused<br>wine to fail from the winepresses:<br>none shall tread with shouting; their<br>b shouting shall be no shouting.<br>34 From the cry of a Heshbon even<br>unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz,<br>have they uttered their voice, from<br>Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an<br>heifer of three years old: for the<br>waters also of Nimrim shall be<br>desolate.<br>35 Moreover I will cause to cease<br>in Moab, saith the LORD, him that<br>offereth in the high places, and him<br>that burneth incense to his gods.<br>36 Therefore mine a heart shall<br>sound for Moab like pipes, and<br>mine heart shall sound like b pipes<br>for the men of Kir-heres: because<br>the c riches that he hath gotten are<br>perished.<br>37 For every head shall be a bald,<br>and every beard clipped: upon all|Col2|the hands shall be cuttings, and upon<br>the loins sackcloth.<br>38 There shall be lamentation gener-<br>ally upon all the housetops of Moab,<br>and in the streets thereof: for I have<br>broken Moab like a a vessel wherein<br>is no pleasure, saith the LORD.<br>39 They shall howl, saying, How<br>is it broken down! how hath Moab<br>turned the back with shame! so shall<br>Moab be a derision and a dismaying<br>to all them about him.<br>40 For thus saith the LORD; Behold,<br>he shall fly as an a eagle, and shall<br>spread his wings over Moab.<br>41 a Kerioth is taken, and the strong<br>holds are b surprised, and the mighty<br>men’s hearts in Moab at that day<br>shall be as the heart of a woman in<br>her pangs.<br>42 And Moab shall be destroyed<br>from being a people, because he hath<br>a magnified himself against the LORD.<br>43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare,<br>shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of<br>Moab, saith the LORD.<br>44 He that fleeth from the fear<br>shall fall into the pit; and he that<br>getteth up out of the pit shall be<br>taken in the snare: for I will bring<br>upon it, even upon Moab, the year<br>of their visitation, saith the LORD.<br>45 They that fled stood under the<br>shadow of Heshbon because of the<br>force: but a fire shall come forth out<br>of a Heshbon, and a flame from the<br>midst of Sihon, and shall devour the<br>corner of b Moab, and the crown of<br>the head of the tumultuous ones.<br>46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the<br>people of Chemosh perisheth: for<br>thy sons are taken captives, and thy<br>daughters captives.<br>47 ¶ Yet will I a bring again the<br>captivity of b Moab in the latter<br>days, saith the LORD.

|CHAPTER 49<br>Judgment and destruction will come<br>upon the people of Ammon, Edom, Ke-<br>dar, Hazor, and Elam.<br>CONCERNING the Ammonites, thus<br>saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons?<br>hath he no heir? why then doth their<br>king inherit Gad, and his people<br>dwell in his cities?<br>2 Therefore, behold, the days come,<br>saith the LORD, that I will cause an<br>alarm of war to be heard in a Rabbah<br>of the bA mmonites; and it shall be<br>a desolate heap, and her c daughters<br>shall be burned with fire: then shall<br>Israel be heir unto them that were<br>his heirs, saith the LORD.<br>3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is<br>spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rab-<br>bah, gird you with sackcloth; la-<br>ment, and run to and fro by the<br>hedges; for their king shall go into<br>a captivity, and his priests and his<br>princes together.<br>4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the<br>valleys, thy flowing valley, O back-<br>sliding daughter? that trusted in<br>her a treasures, saying, Who shall<br>come unto me?<br>5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon<br>thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts,<br>from all those that be about thee;<br>and ye shall be driven out every man<br>right forth; and none shall gather<br>up him that wandereth.<br>6 And afterward I will a bring<br>again the captivity of the children<br>of Ammon, saith the LORD.<br>7 ¶ Concerning a Edom, thus saith<br>the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no<br>more in Teman? is counsel perished<br>from the b prudent? is their wisdom<br>vanished?<br>8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep,<br>O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will|Col2|bring the calamity of Esau upon<br>him, the time that I will visit him.<br>9 If grapegatherers come to thee,<br>would they not leave some gleaning<br>grapes? if a thieves by night, they<br>will destroy till they have enough.<br>10 But I have made a Esau bare, I<br>have uncovered his secret places, and<br>he shall not be able to hide himself:<br>his b seed is spoiled, and his brethren,<br>and his neighbours, and he is not.<br>11 Leave thy fatherless children,<br>I will preserve them alive; and let<br>thy a widows trust in me.<br>12 For thus saith the LORD; Behold,<br>they whose judgment was not to<br>a drink of the cup have assuredly<br>drunken; and art thou he that shall<br>altogether go unpunished? thou<br>shalt not go unpunished, but thou<br>shalt surely drink of it.<br>13 For I have sworn by myself,<br>saith the LORD, that a Bozrah shall<br>become a desolation, a reproach, a<br>waste, and a curse; and all the b cities<br>thereof shall be perpetual wastes.<br>14 I have heard a a rumour from<br>the LORD, and an ambassador is sent<br>unto the b heathen, saying, Gather<br>ye together, and come against her,<br>and rise up to the battle.<br>15 For, lo, I will make thee small<br>among the heathen, and despised<br>among men.<br>16 Thy terribleness hath deceived<br>thee, and the a pride of thine heart,<br>O thou that dwellest in the clefts<br>of the rock, that holdest the height<br>of the hill: though thou shouldest<br>make thy nest as high as the eagle,<br>I will bring thee down from thence,<br>saith the LORD.<br>17 Also a Edom shall be a deso-<br>lation: every one that goeth by it<br>shall be astonished, and shall hiss<br>at all the plagues thereof.|Col4|

|16 But Nebuzar-adan the captain<br>of the guard left certain of the<br>poor of the land for vinedressers<br>and for husbandmen.<br>17 Also the a pillars of brass that<br>were in the house of the LORD, and<br>the bases, and the brasen b sea that<br>was in the house of the LORD, the<br>Chaldeans brake, and carried all<br>the brass of them to Babylon.<br>18 The a caldrons also, and the<br>shovels, and the b snuffers, and the<br>bowls, and the spoons, and all the<br>vessels of brass wherewith they<br>ministered, took they away.<br>19 And the basins, and the firepans,<br>and the bowls, and the caldrons, and<br>the candlesticks, and the spoons, and<br>the cups; that which was of gold in<br>gold, and that which was of silver<br>in silver, took the captain of the<br>guard away.<br>20 The two pillars, one a sea, and<br>b twelve brasen c bulls that were un-<br>der the bases, which king Solomon<br>had made in the house of the LORD:<br>the brass of all these vessels was<br>without weight.<br>21 And concerning the pillars, the<br>height of one pillar was eighteen cu-<br>bits; and a a fillet of twelve b cubits did<br>compass it; and the thickness thereof<br>was four fingers: it was hollow.<br>22 And a a chapiter of brass was<br>upon it; and the height of one chap-<br>iter was five cubits, with network<br>and pomegranates upon the chap-<br>iters round about, all of brass. The<br>second pillar also and the pome-<br>granates were like unto these.<br>23 And there were a ninety and six<br>pomegranates on a side; and all the<br>pomegranates upon the network<br>were an hundred round about.<br>24 ¶ And the captain of the guard<br>took Seraiah the chief priest, and<br>Zephaniah the second priest, and<br>the three keepers of the door:|Col2|25 He took also out of the city an<br>a eunuch, which had the charge of<br>the men of war; and seven b men<br>of them that were near the king’s<br>person, which were found in the<br>city; and the principal scribe of the<br>host, who mustered the people of<br>the land; and threescore men of the<br>people of the land, that were found<br>in the midst of the city.<br>26 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of<br>the guard took them, and brought<br>them to the king of Babylon to<br>Riblah.<br>27 And the king of Babylon smote<br>them, and put them to death in Ri-<br>blah in the land of Hamath.
