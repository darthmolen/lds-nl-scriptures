THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET
EZEKIEL












|CHAPTER 1<br>Ezekiel sees in vision four living crea-<br>tures, four wheels, and the glory of God<br>on His throne.<br>N<br>OW it came to pass in the<br>thirtieth year, in the fourth<br>month, in the fifth day of the<br>month, as I was among the a captives<br>by the river of b Chebar, that the<br>heavens were c opened, and I saw<br>d visions of God.<br>2 In the fifth day of the month,<br>which was the a fifth year of king<br>bJ ehoiachin’s captivity,<br>3 The word of the LORD came<br>expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,<br>the son of Buzi, in the land of the<br>Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and<br>the a hand of the LORD was there<br>upon him.<br>4 ¶ And I looked, and, behold, a<br>a whirlwind came out of the north,<br>a great cloud, and a b fire infolding<br>itself, and a brightness was about it,<br>and out of the midst thereof as the<br>colour of amber, out of the midst<br>of the fire.<br>5 Also out of the midst thereof<br>came the likeness of four living<br>a creatures. And this was their ap-<br>pearance; they had the likeness of<br>a man.<br>6 And every one had four faces,<br>and every one had four wings.<br>7 And their feet were straight feet;<br>and the sole of their feet was like<br>the sole of a calf’s foot: and they<br>sparkled like the colour of bur-<br>nished a brass.|Col2|8 And they had the hands of a man<br>under their wings on their four<br>sides; and they four had their faces<br>and their wings.<br>9 Their wings were joined one to<br>another; they turned not when they<br>went; they went every one a straight<br>forward.<br>10 As for the likeness of their<br>faces, they four had the face of a<br>man, and the face of a lion, on the<br>right side: and they four had the<br>face of an ox on the left side; they<br>four also had the face of an eagle.<br>11 Thus were their faces: and their<br>a wings were stretched upward; two<br>wings of every one were joined one<br>to another, and two covered their<br>bodies.<br>12 And they went every one<br>straight forward: whither the spirit<br>was to go, they went; and they turned<br>not when they went.<br>13 As for the likeness of the living<br>creatures, their appearance was like<br>burning coals of fire, and like the<br>appearance of a lamps: it went up<br>and down among the living crea-<br>tures; and the fire was bright, and<br>out of the fire went forth lightning.<br>14 And the living creatures ran<br>and returned as the appearance of<br>a flash of lightning.<br>15 ¶ Now as I beheld the living<br>creatures, behold one a wheel upon<br>the earth by the living creatures,<br>with his four faces.<br>16 The appearance of the a wheels<br>and their work was like unto the<br>colour of a beryl: and they four|Col4|

|to a b rebellious nation that hath re-<br>belled against me: they and their<br>fathers have transgressed against<br>me, even unto this very day.<br>4 For they are impudent children<br>and a stiffhearted. I do b send thee<br>unto them; and thou shalt say unto<br>them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.<br>5 And they, whether they will hear,<br>or whether they will forbear, (for<br>they are a a rebellious house,) b yet<br>shall know that there hath been a<br>prophet among them.<br>6 ¶ And thou, son of man, a be not<br>b afraid of them, neither be afraid<br>of their words, though briers and<br>thorns be with thee, and thou dost<br>c dwell among scorpions: be not<br>afraid of their words, nor be dis-<br>mayed at their looks, though they<br>be a rebellious house.<br>7 And thou shalt a speak my words<br>unto them, whether they will hear,<br>or whether they will forbear: for<br>they are most rebellious.<br>8 But thou, son of man, hear what<br>I say unto thee; Be not thou rebel-<br>lious like that rebellious house: open<br>thy mouth, and a eat that I give thee.<br>9 ¶ And when I looked, behold, an<br>hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a<br>a roll of a b book was therein;<br>10 And he spread it before me;<br>and it was written a within and with-<br>out: and there was written therein<br>lamentations, and mourning, and<br>woe.<br>CHAPTER 3<br>Ezekiel is made a watchman unto the<br>house of Israel—The blood of Israel is<br>required at his hand unless he raises<br>the warning voice.<br>MOREOVER he said unto me, Son of<br>man, eat that thou findest; eat this|Col2|a roll, and go speak unto the house<br>of Israel.<br>2 So I opened my mouth, and he<br>caused me to eat that roll.<br>3 And he said unto me, Son of man,<br>cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy<br>bowels with this roll that I give thee.<br>Then did I a eat it; and it was in my<br>mouth as honey for sweetness.<br>4 ¶ And he said unto me, Son of<br>man, go, get thee unto the house<br>of Israel, and speak with my words<br>unto them.<br>5 For thou art not sent to a people<br>of a strange speech and of an hard<br>language, but to the house of Israel;<br>6 Not to many people of a strange<br>speech and of an hard language,<br>whose words thou canst not un-<br>derstand.

And he went in in my sight.<br>3 Now the cherubims stood on the<br>right side of the house, when the<br>man went in; and the cloud filled<br>the inner court.<br>4 Then the glory of the LORD went<br>up from the cherub, and stood over<br>the threshold of the house; and the<br>house was filled with the a cloud, and<br>the court was full of the brightness<br>of the LORD’s glory.|Col2|5 And the sound of the cherubims’<br>wings was heard even to the outer<br>court, as the voice of the Almighty<br>God when he speaketh.<br>6 And it came to pass, that when he<br>had commanded the man clothed<br>with linen, saying, Take fire from<br>between the wheels, from between<br>the cherubims; then he went in, and<br>stood beside the wheels.<br>7 And one cherub stretched forth<br>his hand from between the cheru-<br>bims unto the fire that was between<br>the cherubims, and took thereof, and<br>put it into the hands of him that was<br>clothed with linen: who took it, and<br>went out.<br>8 ¶ And there appeared in the<br>cherubims the form of a man’s hand<br>under their wings.<br>9 And when I looked, behold the<br>four wheels by the cherubims, one<br>wheel by one cherub, and another<br>wheel by another cherub: and the<br>appearance of the a wheels was as<br>the colour of a beryl stone.<br>10 And as for their appearances,<br>they four had one likeness, as if a<br>wheel had been in the midst of<br>a wheel.<br>11 When they a went, they went<br>b upon their four sides; they turned<br>not as they went, but to the place<br>whither the c head looked they fol-<br>lowed it; they turned not as they<br>went.<br>12 And their whole body, and their<br>backs, and their hands, and their<br>wings, and the wheels, were full of<br>eyes round about, even the wheels<br>that they four had.<br>13 As for the wheels, it was cried<br>unto them in my hearing, O wheel.<br>14 And every one had four faces:<br>the first face was the face of a<br>a cherub, and the second face was the<br>face of a man, and the third the face<br>of a lion, and the fourth the face of<br>an eagle.<br>15 And the cherubims a were lifted|Col4|

|13 ¶ And it came to pass, when I<br>prophesied, that Pelatiah the son<br>of Benaiah died. Then fell I down<br>upon my face, and cried with a loud<br>voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt<br>thou make a full end of the rem-<br>nant of Israel?<br>14 Again the word of the LORD<br>came unto me, saying,<br>15 Son of man, thy brethren, even<br>thy brethren, a the men of thy kin-<br>dred, and all the house of Israel<br>wholly, are they unto whom the<br>inhabitants of Jerusalem have said,<br>Get you far from the LORD: unto<br>us is this land given in possession.<br>16 Therefore say, Thus saith the<br>Lord GOD; Although I have cast<br>them far off among the heathen,<br>and although I have scattered them<br>among the countries, yet will I be<br>to them as a little a sanctuary in the<br>countries where they shall come.<br>17 Therefore say, Thus saith the<br>Lord GOD; I will even a gather you<br>from the b people, and assemble you<br>out of the countries where ye have<br>been scattered, and I will give you<br>the c land of Israel.<br>18 And they shall come thither,<br>and they shall take away all the de-<br>testable things thereof and all the<br>abominations thereof from thence.<br>19 And I will a give them one b heart,<br>and I will put a c new d spirit within<br>you; and I will take the stony heart<br>out of their flesh, and will give them<br>an e heart of flesh:<br>20 That they may a walk in my stat-<br>utes, and keep mine b ordinances,<br>and do them: and they shall be my<br>c people, and I will be their God.<br>21 But as for them whose heart<br>a walketh after the heart of their<br>detestable things and their abomi-<br>nations, I will b recompense their|Col2|way upon their own heads, saith<br>the Lord GOD.<br>22 ¶ Then did the cherubims lift<br>up their wings, and the wheels<br>beside them; and the a glory of the<br>God of Israel was over them above.<br>23 And the a glory of the LORD went<br>up from the midst of the city, and<br>stood upon the mountain which is<br>on the east side of the city.<br>24 ¶ Afterwards the a spirit took me<br>up, and brought me in a vision by<br>the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to<br>them of the captivity.

Will ye hunt the<br>souls of my people, and will ye save<br>the souls alive that come unto you?<br>19 And will ye pollute me among<br>my people for handfuls of barley<br>and for a pieces of bread, to slay<br>the souls that should not die, and<br>to save the souls alive that should<br>not live, by your lying to my peo-<br>ple that hear your lies?<br>20 Wherefore thus saith the Lord<br>GOD; Behold, I am against your a pil-<br>lows, wherewith ye there hunt the<br>souls to make them fly, and I will<br>tear them from your arms, and will<br>let the souls go, even the souls that<br>ye hunt to make them b fly.<br>21 Your kerchiefs also will I tear,<br>and deliver my people out of your<br>hand, and they shall be no more<br>in your hand to be hunted; and ye<br>shall know that I am the LORD.<br>22 Because with a lies ye have<br>made the heart of the righteous<br>sad, whom I have not made sad;<br>and strengthened the hands of the<br>wicked, that he should not return<br>from his wicked way, b by promis-<br>ing him life:<br>23 Therefore ye shall see no more<br>vanity, nor a divine b divinations:<br>for I will deliver my people out of<br>your hand: and ye shall know that<br>I am the LORD.|Col2|CHAPTER 14<br>The Lord will not answer those who<br>worship false gods and work iniquity<br>—Ezekiel preaches repentance—The<br>people would not be saved though Noah,<br>Daniel, and Job ministered among<br>them.<br>THEN came certain of the a elders of<br>Israel unto me, and sat before me.<br>2 And the word of the LORD came<br>unto me, saying,<br>3 Son of man, these men have set<br>up their idols in their heart, and<br>put the stumblingblock of their<br>a iniquity before their face: should<br>I be b inquired of at all by c them?<br>4 Therefore speak unto them, and<br>say unto them, Thus saith the Lord<br>GOD; Every man of the house of<br>Israel that setteth up his idols in<br>his heart, and putteth the a stum-<br>blingblock of his iniquity before<br>his face, and cometh to the prophet;<br>I the LORD will answer him that<br>cometh according to the multitude<br>of his idols;<br>5 That I may take the house of Is-<br>rael in their own heart, because they<br>are all estranged from me through<br>their idols.<br>6 ¶ Therefore say unto the house<br>of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD;<br>Repent, and turn yourselves from<br>your idols; and turn away your<br>faces from all your abominations.<br>7 For every one of the house of<br>Israel, or of the stranger that so-<br>journeth in Israel, which separateth<br>himself from me, and setteth up<br>his idols in his heart, and putteth<br>the stumblingblock of his iniquity<br>before his face, and cometh to a<br>prophet to inquire of him concern-<br>ing me; I the LORD will answer him<br>by myself:<br>8 And I will set my a face against<br>that man, and will make him a b sign|Col4|
