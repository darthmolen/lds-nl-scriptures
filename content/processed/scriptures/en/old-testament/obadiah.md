AMOS 9:14–OBADIAH 1:12 1146



14 And I will bring again the _**[a ]**_ captivity of my people of _**[b ]**_ Israel, and
they shall _**[c ]**_ build the _**[d ]**_ waste cities,
and inhabit _them;_ and they shall
plant vineyards, and drink the
wine thereof; they shall also make
gardens, and eat the fruit of them.



15 And I will _**[a ]**_ plant them upon
their _**[b ]**_ land, and they shall _**[c ]**_ no more
be pulled up out of their land which
I have given them, saith the LORD
thy God.



OBADIAH












|Obadiah prophesies the downfall of<br>Edom—Saviors will stand upon Mount<br>Zion.<br>T<br>HE vision of Obadiah. Thus<br>saith the Lord GOD concern-<br>ing a Edom; We have heard a<br>rumour from the LORD, and an am-<br>bassador is sent among the heathen,<br>Arise ye, and let us rise up against<br>her in battle.<br>2 Behold, I have made thee small<br>among the heathen: thou art greatly<br>despised.<br>3 ¶ The a pride of thine b heart hath<br>deceived thee, thou that dwellest<br>in the clefts of the rock, whose<br>habitation is high; that saith in his<br>heart, Who shall bring me down to<br>the ground?<br>4 Though thou exalt thyself as the<br>eagle, and though thou set thy nest<br>among the stars, thence will I bring<br>thee down, saith the LORD.<br>5 If a thieves came to thee, if rob-<br>bers by night, (how art thou cut off!)<br>would they not have stolen till they<br>had enough? if the grapegatherers<br>came to thee, would they not leave<br>some grapes?<br>6 How are the things of Esau|Col2|searched out! how are his hidden<br>things sought up!<br>7 All the men of thy confederacy<br>have brought thee even to the bor-<br>der: the men that were at peace<br>with thee have deceived thee, and<br>prevailed against thee; they that eat<br>thy bread have laid a wound under<br>thee: there is none understanding<br>in him.<br>8 Shall I not in a that day, saith the<br>LORD, even destroy the wise men out<br>of Edom, and understanding out of<br>the mount of Esau?<br>9 And thy mighty men, O a Teman,<br>shall be dismayed, to the end that<br>every one of the mount of Esau may<br>be b cut off by slaughter.<br>10 ¶ For thy violence against thy<br>brother Jacob shame shall cover thee,<br>and thou shalt be cut off for ever.<br>11 In the day that thou stoodest<br>on the other side, in the day that<br>the strangers carried away captive<br>his forces, and foreigners entered<br>into his gates, and cast lots upon<br>Jerusalem, even thou wast as a one<br>of them.<br>12 But thou shouldest not have<br>looked on the day of thy brother in<br>the day that he became a stranger;|Col4|
