Why ?|Col2|saith the LORD of hosts. Because<br>of mine house that is waste, and<br>ye run every man unto his own<br>house.<br>10 Therefore the heaven over you<br>is stayed from dew, and the earth is<br>stayed from her a fruit.<br>11 And I called for a a drought<br>upon the land, and upon the moun-<br>tains, and upon the b corn, and upon<br>the new wine, and upon the oil,<br>and upon that which the ground<br>bringeth forth, and upon men, and<br>upon cattle, and upon all the labour<br>of the hands.<br>12 ¶ Then Zerubbabel the son of<br>Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jo-<br>sedech, the high priest, with all the<br>remnant of the people, obeyed the<br>voice of the LORD their God, and<br>the words of Haggai the prophet, as<br>the LORD their God had a sent him,<br>and the people did fear before the<br>LORD.<br>13 Then spake Haggai the LORD’s<br>messenger in the LORD’s message<br>unto the people, saying, I am with<br>you, saith the LORD.<br>14 And the LORD stirred up the<br>spirit of Zerubbabel the son of<br>Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the<br>spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech,<br>the high priest, and the spirit of all<br>the remnant of the people; and they<br>came and did work in the house of<br>the LORD of hosts, their God,<br>15 In the four and twentieth day<br>of the sixth month, in the second<br>year of Darius the king.|Col4|

And the priests answered<br>and said, No.<br>13 Then said Haggai, If one that is<br>unclean by a dead body touch any<br>of these, shall it be unclean? And<br>the priests answered and said, It<br>shall be unclean.<br>14 Then answered Haggai, and<br>said, So is this people, and so is this<br>nation before me, saith the LORD;<br>and so is every work of their hands;<br>and that which they offer there is<br>unclean.<br>15 And now, I pray you, consider<br>from this day and upward, from be-<br>fore a stone was laid upon a stone<br>in the temple of the LORD:<br>16 Since those days were, when one<br>came to an heap of twenty measures,<br>there were but ten: when one came<br>to the a pressfat for to draw out fifty<br>vessels out of the press, there were<br>but twenty.<br>17 I a smote you with b blasting and<br>with mildew and with hail in all<br>the labours of your hands; yet ye<br>c turned not to me, saith the LORD.<br>18 a Consider now from this day<br>and upward, from the four and<br>twentieth day of the ninth month,<br>even from the day that the founda-<br>tion of the LORD’s temple was laid,<br>consider it.<br>19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea,<br>as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and<br>the pomegranate, and the olive tree,<br>hath not brought forth: from this<br>day will I bless you.<br>20 ¶ And again the word of the|Col4|
