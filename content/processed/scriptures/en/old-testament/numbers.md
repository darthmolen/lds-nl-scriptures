LEVITICUS 27:26–NUMBERS 1:3 190



26 ¶ Only the _**[a ]**_ firstling of the
beasts, which should be the LORD’s
firstling, no man shall sanctify it;
whether _it be_ ox, or sheep: it _is_ the
LORD’s.
27 And if _it be_ of an unclean beast,
then he shall redeem _it_ according
to thine estimation, and shall add
a fifth _part_ of it thereto: or if it be
not redeemed, then it shall be sold
according to thy estimation.
28 Notwithstanding no devoted
thing, that a man shall devote unto
the LORD of all that he hath, _both_
of man and beast, and of the field
of his possession, shall be _**[a ]**_ sold or
redeemed: every devoted thing _is_
most holy unto the LORD.
29 None devoted, which shall be
devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
_but_ shall surely be put to death.



30 And all the _**[a ]**_ tithe of the land,
_whether_ of the seed of the land, _or_ of
the fruit of the tree, _is_ the LORD’s:
_it is_ holy unto the LORD.
31 And if a man will at all redeem _ought_ of his tithes, he shall
add thereto the fifth _part_ thereof.
32 And concerning the tithe of the
herd, or of the flock, _even_ of whatsoever passeth under the _**[a ]**_ rod, the
tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
33 He shall not search whether
it be good or bad, neither shall he
change it: and if he change it at
all, then both it and the change
thereof shall be holy; it shall not
be redeemed.
34 These _are_ the commandments,
which the LORD commanded Moses
for the children of Israel in mount
Sinai.

And Balak the son of Zippor<br>was king of the Moabites at that time.<br>5 He sent messengers therefore<br>unto a Balaam the son of Beor to<br>Pethor, which is by the river of the<br>land of the children of his people, to<br>call him, saying, Behold, there is a<br>people come out from Egypt: behold,<br>they cover the face of the earth, and<br>they abide over against me:<br>6 Come now therefore, I pray thee,<br>curse me this people; for they are<br>too mighty for me: peradventure<br>I shall prevail, that we may smite<br>them, and that I may drive them<br>out of the land: for I a wot that he<br>whom thou blessest is blessed, and<br>he whom thou cursest is cursed.<br>7 And the elders of Moab and the<br>elders of Midian departed with the<br>a rewards of b divination in their<br>hand; and they came unto Balaam,<br>and spake unto him the words of<br>Balak.<br>8 And he said unto them, Lodge<br>here this night, and I will bring<br>you word again, as the LORD shall<br>speak unto me: and the a princes of<br>Moab abode with Balaam.<br>9 And God came unto Balaam, and<br>said, What men are these with thee?<br>10 And Balaam said unto God,<br>Balak the son of Zippor, king of<br>Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,<br>11 Behold, there is a people come<br>out of Egypt, which covereth the<br>face of the earth: come now, curse<br>me them; peradventure I shall be<br>able to overcome them, and drive<br>them out.|Col2|12 And God said unto Balaam,<br>Thou shalt not go with them; thou<br>shalt not curse the people: for they<br>are blessed.<br>13 And Balaam rose up in the<br>morning, and said unto the princes<br>of Balak, Get you into your land: for<br>the LORD refuseth to give me leave<br>to go with you.<br>14 And the princes of Moab rose<br>up, and they went unto Balak,<br>and said, Balaam refuseth to come<br>with us.<br>15 ¶ And Balak sent yet again<br>princes, more, and more honour-<br>able than they.<br>16 And they came to Balaam, and<br>said to him, Thus saith Balak the son<br>of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee,<br>hinder thee from coming unto me:<br>17 For I will promote thee unto<br>very great honour, and I will do<br>whatsoever thou sayest unto me:<br>come therefore, I pray thee, curse<br>me this people.<br>18 And Balaam answered and said<br>unto the servants of Balak, If Balak<br>would give me his house full of sil-<br>ver and gold, I cannot go beyond<br>the word of the LORD my God, to<br>do less or more.<br>19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry<br>ye also here this night, that I may<br>know what the LORD will say unto<br>me more.<br>20 And God came unto Balaam<br>at night, and said unto him, If the<br>men come to call thee, rise up, and<br>go with them; but yet the word<br>which I shall say unto thee, that<br>shalt thou do.<br>21 And Balaam rose up in the<br>morning, and saddled his ass, and<br>went with the princes of Moab.<br>22 ¶ And God’s anger was kindled<br>because he went: and the angel of<br>the LORD stood in the way for an<br>adversary against him.
