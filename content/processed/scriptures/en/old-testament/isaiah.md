861 SONG OF SOLOMON 8:6–ISAIAH 1:4



apple tree: there thy mother brought
thee forth: there she brought thee
forth _that_ bare thee.
6 ¶ Set me as a seal upon thine
heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for
love _is_ strong as death; jealousy _is_
_**a**_ cruel as the grave: the coals thereof
_are_ coals of fire, _which hath_ a most
vehement flame.
7 Many waters cannot quench love,
neither can the floods drown it: if
a man would give all the substance
of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
8 ¶ We have a little sister, and she
hath no breasts: what shall we do
for our sister in the day when she
shall be spoken for?
9 If she _be_ a wall, we will build
upon her a palace of silver: and if



she _be_ a door, we will inclose her
with boards of cedar.
10 I _am_ a wall, and my breasts like
towers: then was I in his eyes as one
that found favour.
11 Solomon had a vineyard at
Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for
the fruit thereof was to bring a
thousand _pieces_ of silver.
12 My vineyard, which _is_ mine, _is_
before me: thou, O Solomon, _must_
_have_ a thousand, and those that
keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to
thy voice: cause me to hear _it._
14 ¶ Make haste, my beloved, and
be thou like to a roe or to a young
_**a**_ hart upon the mountains of spices.

I<br>am the LORD, and there is none else.<br>7 I form the a light, and create<br>darkness: I make peace, and create<br>b evil: I the LORD do all these things.<br>8 Drop down, ye heavens, from<br>above, and let the skies pour down<br>a righteousness: let the earth open,<br>and let b them bring forth c salvation,<br>and let righteousness spring up to-<br>gether; I the LORD have created it.<br>9 Woe unto him that a striveth with<br>his b Maker! Let the potsherd strive<br>with the potsherds of the earth.<br>Shall the c clay say to him that fash-<br>ioneth it, What makest thou? or thy<br>work, He hath no hands?<br>10 Woe unto him that saith unto<br>his father, What begettest thou?<br>or to a the woman, What hast thou<br>brought forth?|Col2|11 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy<br>One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask<br>me of things to come concerning my<br>a sons, and concerning the b work of<br>my hands c command ye me.<br>12 I have a made the earth, and<br>b created man upon it: I, even my<br>hands, have stretched out the<br>heavens, and all their c host have I<br>commanded.<br>13 I have raised a him up in righ-<br>teousness, and I will direct all his<br>ways: he shall b build my city, and<br>he shall let go my captives, not for<br>c price nor reward, saith the LORD<br>of hosts.<br>14 Thus saith the LORD, The la-<br>bour of a Egypt, and merchandise of<br>Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of<br>stature, shall come over unto thee,<br>and they shall be thine: they shall<br>come b after thee; in chains they shall<br>come over, and they shall fall down<br>unto thee, they shall make suppli-<br>cation unto thee, saying, Surely God<br>is in thee; and there is c none else,<br>there is no God.<br>15 Verily thou art a God that a hid-<br>est thyself, O God of Israel, the<br>b Saviour.<br>16 They shall be ashamed, and<br>also confounded, all of them: they<br>shall go to confusion together that<br>are makers of a idols.<br>17 But Israel shall be a saved in the<br>b LORD with an everlasting c salva-<br>tion: ye shall not be ashamed nor<br>confounded world without end.|Col4|

|14 And when ye see this, your heart<br>shall rejoice, and your bones shall<br>flourish like an herb: and the a hand<br>of the LORD shall be known toward<br>his servants, and his b indignation<br>toward his enemies.<br>15 For, behold, the LORD will come<br>with a fire, and with his b chariots<br>like a whirlwind, to render his an-<br>ger with fury, and his rebuke with<br>flames of fire.<br>16 For by fire and by his a sword<br>will b the LORD c plead with all flesh:<br>and the d slain of the LORD shall be<br>many.<br>17 They that sanctify themselves,<br>and purify themselves in the gar-<br>dens behind one tree in the midst,<br>eating swine’s flesh, and the a abomi-<br>nation, and the b mouse, shall be<br>consumed together, saith the LORD.<br>18 For I a know their b works and<br>their thoughts: it shall come, that I<br>will gather c all nations and tongues;<br>and they shall come, and see my<br>glory.<br>19 And I will set a a sign among<br>them, and I will send those that<br>escape of them unto the nations, to<br>Tarshish, Pul, and b Lud, that draw<br>the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the<br>isles afar off, that have not heard|Col2|my fame, neither have seen my<br>glory; and they shall c declare my<br>glory among the d Gentiles.<br>20 And they shall bring all your<br>brethren for an a offering unto the<br>LORD out of all nations upon horses,<br>and in chariots, and in litters, and<br>upon mules, and upon swift beasts,<br>to my holy mountain Jerusalem,<br>saith the LORD, as the children of<br>Israel bring an offering in a clean<br>vessel into the house of the LORD.<br>21 And I will also take of them<br>for a priests and for Levites, saith<br>the LORD.<br>22 For as the a new heavens and<br>the new earth, which I will make,<br>shall remain before me, saith the<br>LORD, so shall your b seed and your<br>name remain.<br>23 And it shall come to pass, that<br>from one new moon to another, and<br>from one sabbath to another, shall<br>all flesh come to a worship before<br>me, saith the LORD.<br>24 And they shall go forth, and<br>look upon the carcases of the men<br>that have transgressed against me:<br>for their a worm shall not die, nei-<br>ther shall their b fire be quenched;<br>and they shall be an abhorring unto<br>all flesh.|Col4|
