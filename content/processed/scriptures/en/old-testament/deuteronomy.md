NUMBERS 36:9–DEUTERONOMY 1:7 252



possesseth an inheritance in any
tribe of the children of Israel, shall
be wife unto one of the family of
the tribe of her father, that the
children of Israel may enjoy every
man the inheritance of his fathers.
9 Neither shall the inheritance
remove from _one_ tribe to another
tribe; but every one of the tribes
of the children of Israel shall keep
himself to his own inheritance.
10 Even as the LORD commanded
Moses, so did the daughters of
Zelophehad:
11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah,



and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married
unto their father’s brothers’ sons:
12 _And_ they were married into the
families of the sons of Manasseh the
son of Joseph, and their inheritance
remained in the tribe of the family
of their father.
13 These _are_ the commandments
and the judgments, which the LORD
commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in
the plains of Moab by Jordan _near_
Jericho.

|Moses had made an end of writing<br>the words of this law in a book, un-<br>til they were finished,<br>25 That Moses commanded the<br>Levites, which bare the ark of the<br>covenant of the LORD, saying,<br>26 Take this a book of the b law, and<br>put it in the side of the c ark of the<br>covenant of the LORD your God,<br>that it may be there for a d witness<br>against thee.<br>27 For I know thy a rebellion, and<br>thy b stiff neck: behold, while I am<br>yet alive with you this day, ye have<br>been rebellious against the LORD;<br>and how much more after my death?<br>28 ¶ Gather unto me all the elders<br>of your tribes, and your officers, that<br>I may speak these words in their<br>ears, and call heaven and earth to<br>record against them.<br>29 For I know that after my death<br>ye will utterly a corrupt yourselves,<br>and turn aside from the way which<br>I have commanded you; and evil<br>will befall you in the b latter days;<br>because ye will do evil in the sight<br>of the LORD, to provoke him to an-<br>ger through the work of your hands.<br>30 And Moses spake in the ears<br>of all the congregation of Israel<br>the words of this song, until they<br>were ended.<br>CHAPTER 32<br>Israel will sing the song of Moses and<br>acclaim: God speaks to heaven and<br>earth; the children of Israel were known<br>in the premortal life; God chose them<br>in this life; they forgot the Rock of their<br>salvation; He sent terror, a sword, and|Col2|vengeance upon them; there is no God<br>beside Him—Moses will be gathered<br>to his people.<br>a GIVE ear, O ye heavens, and I will<br>speak; and b hear, O earth, the c words<br>of my mouth.<br>2 My doctrine shall drop as the<br>a rain, my b speech shall distil as<br>the c dew, as the small rain upon<br>the tender herb, and as the showers<br>upon the grass:<br>3 Because I will a publish the name<br>of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness<br>unto our God.<br>4 He is the a Rock, his work is b per-<br>fect: for all his ways are c judgment:<br>a God of truth and without iniquity,<br>d just and right is he.<br>5 They have corrupted themselves,<br>a their spot is not the spot of his<br>b children: they are a c perverse and<br>crooked d generation.<br>6 Do ye thus a requite the LORD, O<br>foolish people and unwise? is not<br>he thy b father that hath c bought<br>thee? hath he not d made thee, and<br>established thee?<br>7 ¶ a Remember the days of old,<br>consider the years of many genera-<br>tions: b ask thy father, and he will<br>shew thee; thy elders, and they will<br>tell thee.<br>8 When the most High divided<br>to the a nations their b inheritance,<br>when he separated the sons of<br>Adam, he set the c bounds of the<br>people according to the number of<br>the children of Israel.<br>9 For the LORD’s portion is his<br>people; Jacob is the lot of his a in-<br>heritance.|Col4|

|of the LORD be his b land, for the<br>c precious things of heaven, for the<br>dew, and for the deep that coucheth<br>beneath,<br>14 And for the precious fruits brought<br>forth by the sun, and for the precious<br>things put forth by the moon,<br>15 And for the chief things of the<br>ancient mountains, and for the pre-<br>cious things of the lasting a hills,<br>16 And for the precious things of<br>the earth and fulness thereof, and<br>for the good will of him that dwelt<br>in the a bush: let the b blessing come<br>upon the head of Joseph, and upon<br>the top of the head of him that was<br>separated from his brethren.<br>17 His a glory is like the firstling of<br>his bullock, and his horns are like<br>the horns of b unicorns: with them<br>he shall c push the people together<br>to the ends of the earth: and they<br>are the ten thousands of d Ephraim,<br>and they are the thousands of Ma-<br>nasseh.<br>18 ¶ And of a Zebulun he said, Re-<br>joice, Zebulun, in thy going out;<br>and, b Issachar, in thy tents.<br>19 They shall call the people unto<br>the mountain; there they shall offer<br>sacrifices of righteousness: for they<br>shall suck of the abundance of the<br>seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.<br>20 ¶ And of a Gad he said, Blessed<br>be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwell-<br>eth as a lion, and teareth the arm<br>b with the crown of the head.<br>21 And he provided the a first part<br>for himself, because there, in a por-<br>tion of the lawgiver, was he seated;<br>and he came b with the heads of the<br>people, he executed the justice of|Col2|the LORD, and his judgments with<br>Israel.<br>22 ¶ And of a Dan he said, Dan is<br>a b lion’s whelp: he shall leap from<br>Bashan.<br>23 ¶ And of a Naphtali he said, O<br>Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and<br>full with the blessing of the LORD:<br>possess thou the b west and the south.<br>24 ¶ And of aA sher he said, Let<br>Asher be blessed with children; let<br>him be acceptable to his brethren,<br>and let him dip his foot in oil.<br>25 Thy a shoes shall be iron and<br>brass; and as thy days, so shall thy<br>strength be.<br>26 ¶ There is none like unto the<br>God of aJ eshurun, who rideth upon<br>the heaven in thy help, and in his<br>b excellency on the sky.<br>27 The a eternal God is thy b refuge,<br>and underneath are the everlasting<br>arms: and he shall thrust out the<br>c enemy from before thee; and shall<br>say, Destroy them.<br>28 a Israel then shall dwell in b safety<br>alone: the c fountain of Jacob shall be<br>upon a land of corn and wine; also<br>his d heavens shall drop down dew.<br>29 a Happy art thou, O Israel: who<br>is like unto thee, O people saved by<br>the LORD, the b shield of thy help,<br>and who is the sword of thy c ex-<br>cellency! and thine enemies shall<br>d be found liars unto thee; and thou<br>shalt tread upon their e high places.<br>CHAPTER 34<br>Moses sees the promised land and is<br>taken by the Lord—Joshua leads Israel—<br>Moses was Israel’s greatest prophet.|Col4|
