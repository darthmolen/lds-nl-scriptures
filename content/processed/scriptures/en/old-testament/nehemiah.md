And it came<br>to pass in the month a Chisleu,<br>in the twentieth year, as I was in<br>b Shushan the palace,<br>2 That a Hanani, one of my breth-<br>ren, came, he and certain men of Ju-<br>dah; and I asked them concerning<br>the Jews that had escaped, which<br>were left of the captivity, and con-<br>cerning Jerusalem.<br>3 And they said unto me, The a rem-<br>nant that are left of the captivity<br>there in the province are in great<br>affliction and reproach: the wall<br>of Jerusalem also is broken down,<br>and the gates thereof are burned<br>with fire.<br>4 ¶ And it came to pass, when I<br>heard these words, that I sat down|Col2|and wept, and mourned certain days,<br>and a fasted, and prayed before the<br>God of heaven,<br>5 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD<br>God of heaven, a the great and ter-<br>rible God, that b keepeth covenant<br>and mercy for them that love him<br>and observe his commandments:<br>6 Let thine ear now be attentive,<br>and thine eyes open, that thou may-<br>est hear the prayer of thy servant,<br>which I pray before thee now, day<br>and night, for the children of Israel<br>thy servants, and a confess the sins<br>of the children of Israel, which we<br>have sinned against thee: both I<br>and my father’s house have sinned.<br>7 We have dealt very corruptly<br>against thee, and have not kept the<br>commandments, nor the statutes,<br>nor the judgments, which thou<br>commandedst thy servant Moses.<br>8 Remember, I beseech thee, the<br>word that thou commandedst thy|Col4|

Now I<br>had not been beforetime sad in his<br>presence.<br>2 Wherefore the king said unto<br>me, Why is thy countenance sad,<br>seeing thou art not sick? this is noth-<br>ing else but sorrow of heart. Then I<br>was very sore afraid,<br>3 And said unto the king, Let the<br>king live for ever: why should not<br>my countenance be a sad, when the<br>city, the place of my fathers’ sep-<br>ulchres, lieth waste, and the gates<br>thereof are consumed with fire?|Col2|4 Then the king said unto me, For<br>what dost thou make request? So I<br>prayed to the God of heaven.<br>5 And I said unto the king, If it<br>please the king, and if thy servant<br>have found favour in thy sight, that<br>thou wouldest send me unto Judah,<br>unto the city of my fathers’ sepul-<br>chres, that I may build it.<br>6 And the king said unto me, (the<br>queen also sitting by him,) For how<br>long shall thy journey be? and when<br>wilt thou return?

|9 Then I commanded, and they<br>cleansed the chambers: and thither<br>brought I again the vessels of the<br>house of God, with the meat offer-<br>ing and the frankincense.<br>10 ¶ And I perceived that the por-<br>tions of the Levites had not been<br>given them: for the Levites and the<br>singers, that did the work, were fled<br>every one to his field.<br>11 Then contended I with the rul-<br>ers, and said, Why is the house of<br>God forsaken? And I gathered them<br>together, and set them in their place.<br>12 Then brought all Judah the<br>a tithe of the corn and the new wine<br>and the oil unto the b treasuries.<br>13 And I made treasurers over the<br>treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and<br>Zadok the scribe, and of the Lev-<br>ites, Pedaiah: and next to them was<br>Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of<br>Mattaniah: for they were counted<br>faithful, and their office was to dis-<br>tribute unto their brethren.<br>14 Remember me, O my God, con-<br>cerning this, and wipe not out my<br>good deeds that I have done for<br>the house of my God, and for the<br>offices thereof.<br>15 ¶ In those days saw I in Judah<br>some treading wine presses on the<br>a sabbath, and bringing in sheaves,<br>and lading asses; as also wine,<br>grapes, and figs, and all manner of<br>burdens, which they brought into<br>Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and<br>I testified against them in the day<br>wherein they sold b victuals.<br>16 There dwelt men of Tyre also<br>therein, which brought fish, and<br>all manner of ware, and sold on<br>the sabbath unto the children of<br>Judah, and in Jerusalem.<br>17 Then I contended with the no-<br>bles of Judah, and said unto them,<br>What evil thing is this that ye do,<br>and profane the sabbath day ?<br>18 Did not your fathers thus, and<br>did not our God bring all this evil<br>upon us, and upon this city ? yet|Col2|ye bring more wrath upon Israel<br>by profaning the sabbath.<br>19 And it came to pass, that when<br>the gates of Jerusalem began to be<br>dark before the sabbath, I com-<br>manded that the gates should be<br>shut, and charged that they should<br>not be opened till after the sabbath:<br>and some of my servants set I at the<br>gates, that there should no burden<br>be brought in on the sabbath day.<br>20 So the merchants and sellers<br>of all kind of ware lodged a without<br>Jerusalem once or twice.<br>21 Then I testified against them,<br>and said unto them, Why lodge ye<br>about the wall? if ye do so again, I<br>will lay hands on you. From that<br>time forth came they no more on<br>the sabbath.<br>22 And I commanded the Levites<br>that they should cleanse them-<br>selves, and that they should come<br>and keep the gates, to sanctify the<br>sabbath day. Remember me, O my<br>God, concerning this also, and spare<br>me according to the greatness of<br>thy mercy.<br>23 ¶ In those days also saw I Jews<br>that had married wives of Ashdod,<br>of Ammon, and of Moab:<br>24 And their children spake half<br>in the speech of Ashdod, and could<br>not speak in the Jews’ a language,<br>but according to the language of<br>each people.<br>25 And I contended with them, and<br>cursed them, and smote certain of<br>them, and plucked off their hair, and<br>made them swear by God, saying, Ye<br>shall not a give your daughters unto<br>b their sons, nor take their daughters<br>unto your sons, or for yourselves.<br>26 Did not a Solomon king of Israel<br>sin by these things? yet among many<br>nations was there no king like him,<br>who was beloved of his God, and<br>God made him king over all Israel:<br>nevertheless even him did outland-<br>ish women cause to sin.<br>27 Shall we then hearken unto you|Col4|
