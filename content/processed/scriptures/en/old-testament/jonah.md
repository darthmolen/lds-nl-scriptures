1147 OBADIAH 1:13–JONAH 1:2



neither shouldest thou have _**[a ]**_ rejoiced over the children of Judah in
the day of their destruction; neither
shouldest thou have spoken proudly
in the day of distress.
13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
the day of their calamity; yea, thou
shouldest not have looked on their
affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid _hands_ on their substance in the day of their calamity;
14 Neither shouldest thou have
stood in the crossway, to cut off
those of his that did escape; neither
shouldest thou have delivered up
those of his that did remain in the
day of distress.
15 For the _**[a ]**_ day of the LORD _is_ near
upon all the _**[b ]**_ heathen: as thou hast
_**c**_ done, it shall be done unto thee:
thy _**[d ]**_ reward shall return upon thine
own head.
16 For as ye have _**[a ]**_ drunk upon my
holy mountain, _so_ shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they
shall drink, and they shall swallow
down, and they shall be as though
they had not been.



17 ¶ But upon mount _**[a ]**_ Zion shall
be _**[b ]**_ deliverance, and there shall be
holiness; and the house of Jacob
shall _**[c ]**_ possess their possessions.
18 And the house of Jacob shall
be a _**[a ]**_ fire, and the house of Joseph
a flame, and the house of _**[b ]**_ Esau for
stubble, and they shall kindle in
them, and devour them; and there
shall not be _any_ remaining of the
house of Esau; for the LORD hath
spoken _it._
19 And _they of_ the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and _they of_
the plain the _**[a ]**_ Philistines: and they
shall possess the fields of Ephraim,
and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin _shall possess_ Gilead.
20 And the captivity of this host
of the children of Israel _shall pos-_
_sess_ that of the Canaanites, _even_
unto Zarephath; and the captivity
of Jerusalem, which _is_ in Sepharad,
shall possess the cities of the south.
21 And _**[a ]**_ saviours shall come up on
_**b**_ mount Zion to _**c**_ judge the mount
of Esau; and the _**[d ]**_ kingdom shall be
the LORD’s.

JONAH 1:3–2:6 1148












|3 But Jonah rose up to a flee unto<br>Tarshish from the b presence of the<br>LORD, and went down to Joppa; and<br>he found a ship going to Tarshish:<br>so he paid the fare thereof, and<br>went down into it, to go with them<br>unto Tarshish from the presence of<br>the LORD.<br>4 ¶ But the LORD sent out a great<br>wind into the sea, and there was a<br>mighty a tempest in the sea, so that<br>the ship was like to be broken.<br>5 Then the mariners were afraid,<br>and cried every man unto his god,<br>and cast forth the wares that were<br>in the ship into the sea, to lighten it<br>of them. But Jonah was gone down<br>into the sides of the ship; and he<br>lay, and was fast asleep.<br>6 So the shipmaster came to him,<br>and said unto him, What meanest<br>thou, O sleeper? arise, a call upon<br>thy God, if so be that God will think<br>upon us, that we perish not.<br>7 And they said every one to his<br>fellow, Come, and let us cast lots,<br>that we may know for whose cause<br>this evil is upon us. So they cast lots,<br>and the lot fell upon Jonah.<br>8 Then said they unto him, Tell<br>us, we pray thee, for whose cause<br>this evil is upon us; What is thine<br>occupation? and whence comest<br>thou? what is thy country ? and of<br>what people art thou?<br>9 And he said unto them, I am an<br>Hebrew; and I fear the a LORD, the<br>God of heaven, which hath made<br>the sea and the dry land.<br>10 Then were the men exceedingly<br>afraid, and said unto him, Why hast<br>thou done this? For the men knew<br>that he fled from the presence of<br>the LORD, because he had told them.<br>11 ¶ Then said they unto him,<br>What shall we do unto thee, that the<br>sea may be calm unto us? for the sea<br>wrought, and was tempestuous.<br>12 And he said unto them, Take|Col2|me up, and cast me forth into the<br>sea; so shall the sea be calm unto<br>you: for I know that for my sake this<br>great tempest is upon you.<br>13 Nevertheless the men rowed<br>hard to bring it to the land; but<br>they could not: for the sea wrought,<br>and was tempestuous against them.<br>14 Wherefore they cried unto the<br>LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O<br>LORD, we beseech thee, let us not<br>perish for this man’s life, and lay not<br>upon us innocent blood: for thou, O<br>LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.<br>15 So they took up Jonah, and cast<br>him forth into the sea: and the sea<br>ceased from her raging.<br>16 Then the men feared the LORD<br>exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice<br>unto the LORD, and made vows.<br>17 ¶ Now the LORD had prepared<br>a great fish to swallow up Jonah.<br>And Jonah was in the belly of the<br>fish a three days and three nights.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>Jonah prays to the Lord, and the fish<br>vomits him out on dry ground.<br>THEN Jonah prayed unto the LORD<br>his God out of the fish’s belly,<br>2 And said, I cried by reason of<br>mine a affliction unto the LORD, and<br>he heard me; out of the belly of b hell<br>cried I, and thou heardest my voice.<br>3 For thou hadst cast me into the<br>deep, in the midst of the seas; and<br>the floods compassed me about: all<br>thy billows and thy waves passed<br>over me.<br>4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy<br>sight; yet I will look again toward<br>thy holy a temple.<br>5 The waters compassed me about,<br>a even to the soul: the depth closed<br>me round about, the weeds were<br>wrapped about my head.<br>6 I went down to the bottoms of the<br>mountains; the earth with her bars|Col4|

Therefore I fled before<br>unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou<br>art a gracious God, and a merciful,<br>slow to anger, and of great kindness,<br>and b repentest thee of the evil.<br>3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I<br>beseech thee, my life from me; for<br>it is better for me to die than to live.|Col4|
