1137 JOEL 3:14–AMOS 1:4



14 Multitudes, _**[a ]**_ multitudes in the
valley of decision: for the _**[b ]**_ day of
the LORD _is_ near in the valley of
decision.
15 The _**[a ]**_ sun and the moon shall
be _**[b ]**_ darkened, and the stars shall
withdraw their shining.
16 The _**[a ]**_ LORD also shall _**[b ]**_ roar out
of _**[c ]**_ Zion, and _**[d ]**_ utter his voice from
Jerusalem; and the heavens and the
earth shall _**[e ]**_ shake: but the LORD _will_
_be_ the _**[f ]**_ hope of his people, and the
strength of the children of Israel.
17 So shall ye know that I _am_ the
LORD your God _**[a ]**_ dwelling in Zion,
my holy _**[b ]**_ mountain: then shall _**[c ]**_ Jerusalem be holy, and there shall
no _**[d ]**_ strangers pass through her any
more.



18 ¶ And it shall come to pass in
that day, _that_ the _**[a ]**_ mountains shall
drop down new wine, and the hills
shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters,
and a _**[b ]**_ fountain shall come forth of
the house of the LORD, and shall
water the valley of Shittim.
19 _**[a ]**_ Egypt shall be a desolation,
and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence _against_ the
children of Judah, because they have
shed innocent blood in their land.
20 But Judah shall dwell for ever,
and Jerusalem from generation to
generation.
21 For I will cleanse their blood
_that_ I have not cleansed: for the
LORD dwelleth in _**[a ]**_ Zion.
