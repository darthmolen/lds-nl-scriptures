to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying
_**a**_ strange wives?
28 And _one_ of the sons of Joiada,
the son of Eliashib the high priest,
_was_ son in law to Sanballat the
Horonite: therefore I chased him
from me.
29 Remember them, O my God,
because they have defiled the



_**a**_ priesthood, and the _**b**_ covenant of
the priesthood, and of the Levites.
30 Thus cleansed I them from all
_**a**_ strangers, and appointed the wards
of the priests and the Levites, every
one in his business;
31 And for the _**[a ]**_ wood offering, at
times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God,
for good.

|10 ¶ On the seventh day, when<br>the heart of the king was merry<br>with wine, he commanded Mehu-<br>man, Biztha, a Harbona, Bigtha, and<br>Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the<br>seven chamberlains that served<br>in the presence of Ahasuerus the<br>king,<br>11 To bring Vashti the queen before<br>the king with the crown royal, to<br>shew the people and the princes her<br>beauty: for she was fair to look on.<br>12 But the queen Vashti refused to<br>come at the king’s commandment<br>by his chamberlains: therefore was<br>the king very a wroth, and his anger<br>burned in him.<br>13 ¶ Then the king said to the a wise<br>men, which knew the b times, (for<br>so was the king’s manner toward<br>all that knew law and judgment:<br>14 And the next unto him was<br>Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tar-<br>shish, Meres, Marsena, and Me-<br>mucan, the seven princes of Persia<br>and Media, which saw the king’s<br>face, and which sat the first in the<br>kingdom;)<br>15 What shall we do unto the queen<br>Vashti according to law, because<br>she hath not performed the com-<br>mandment of the king Ahasuerus<br>by the chamberlains?<br>16 And Memucan answered before<br>the king and the princes, Vashti the<br>queen hath not done wrong to the<br>king only, but also to all the princes,<br>and to all the people that are in all<br>the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.<br>17 For this deed of the queen shall<br>come abroad unto all women, so<br>that they shall despise their hus-<br>bands in their eyes, when it shall<br>be reported, The king Ahasuerus<br>commanded Vashti the queen to<br>be brought in before him, but she<br>came not.<br>18 Likewise shall the ladies of Per-<br>sia and Media say this day unto all<br>the king’s princes, which have heard<br>of the deed of the queen. Thus shall|Col2|there arise too much contempt and<br>wrath.<br>19 If it please the king, let there<br>go a royal commandment from him,<br>and let it be written among the<br>laws of the Persians and the Medes,<br>that it be not a altered, That Vashti<br>come no more before king Ahasu-<br>erus; and let the king give her royal<br>estate unto another that is better<br>than she.<br>20 And when the king’s decree<br>which he shall make shall be pub-<br>lished throughout all his empire,<br>(for it is great,) all the a wives shall<br>give to their husbands honour, both<br>to great and small.<br>21 And the saying pleased the king<br>and the princes; and the king did<br>according to the word of Memucan:<br>22 For he sent letters into all the<br>king’s provinces, into every province<br>according to the writing thereof,<br>and to every people after their a lan-<br>guage, that every man should bear<br>b rule in his own house, and that it<br>should be published according to<br>the language of every people.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>Ahasuerus seeks a new queen—Morde-<br>cai presents Esther—Esther pleases the<br>king and is chosen as queen—Mordecai<br>exposes a plot against the king.<br>AFTER these things, when the wrath<br>of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he<br>remembered Vashti, and what she<br>had done, and what was decreed<br>against her.<br>2 Then said the king’s servants<br>that ministered unto him, Let there<br>be fair young virgins sought for<br>the king:<br>3 And let the king appoint officers<br>in all the provinces of his kingdom,<br>that they may gather together all<br>the fair young virgins unto Shushan<br>the palace, to the house of the<br>women, unto the custody of Hege the<br>king’s chamberlain, keeper of the|Col4|

And the thing pleased the<br>king; and he did so.<br>5 ¶ Now in Shushan the palace<br>there was a certain Jew, whose<br>name was Mordecai, the son of Jair,<br>the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,<br>a Benjamite;<br>6 Who had been a carried away<br>from b Jerusalem with the captiv-<br>ity which had been carried away<br>with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom<br>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Bab-<br>ylon had carried away.<br>7 And he brought up Hadassah,<br>that is, Esther, his uncle’s daugh-<br>ter: for she had neither father nor<br>mother, and the maid was fair and<br>beautiful; whom Mordecai, when<br>her father and mother were dead,<br>took for his own daughter.<br>8 ¶ So it came to pass, when the<br>king’s commandment and his de-<br>cree was heard, and when many<br>maidens were gathered together<br>unto Shushan the palace, to the<br>custody of Hegai, that Esther was<br>brought also unto the king’s house,<br>to the custody of Hegai, keeper of<br>the women.<br>9 And the maiden pleased him, and<br>she obtained kindness of him;<br>and he speedily gave her her things<br>for purification, with such things as<br>belonged to her, and seven maid-<br>ens, which were meet to be given her,<br>out of the king’s house: and he pre-<br>ferred her and her maids unto the<br>best place of the house of the women.<br>10 Esther had not shewed her peo-<br>ple nor her kindred: for Mordecai<br>had a charged her that she should<br>not shew it.<br>11 And Mordecai walked every<br>day before the court of the women’s<br>house, to know how Esther did, and<br>what should become of her.<br>12 ¶ Now when every maid’s turn<br>was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,|Col2|after that she had been twelve<br>months, according to the manner of<br>the women, (for so were the days of<br>their a purifications accomplished,<br>to wit, six months with oil of myrrh,<br>and six months with sweet odours,<br>and with other things for the puri-<br>fying of the women;)<br>13 Then thus came every maiden<br>unto the king; whatsoever she de-<br>sired was given her to go with her<br>out of the house of the women unto<br>the king’s house.<br>14 In the evening she went, and<br>on the morrow she returned into<br>the second house of the women, to<br>the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s<br>chamberlain, which kept the a con-<br>cubines: she came in unto the king<br>no more, except the king delighted<br>in her, and that she were called<br>by name.<br>15 ¶ Now when the turn of Esther,<br>the a daughter of Abihail the uncle<br>of Mordecai, who had taken her<br>for his daughter, was come to go in<br>unto the king, she required nothing<br>but what Hegai the king’s cham-<br>berlain, the keeper of the women,<br>appointed. And Esther obtained<br>favour in the sight of all them that<br>looked upon her.<br>16 So Esther was taken unto king<br>Ahasuerus into his house royal<br>in the tenth month, which is the<br>month Tebeth, in the seventh year<br>of his reign.<br>17 And the king loved Esther above<br>all the women, and she obtained<br>grace and favour in his sight more<br>than all the virgins; so that he set<br>the royal crown upon her head, and<br>made her queen instead of Vashti.<br>18 Then the king made a great<br>feast unto all his princes and his<br>servants, even Esther’s feast; and he<br>made a release to the provinces, and<br>gave gifts, according to the state of<br>the king.<br>19 And when the virgins were<br>gathered together the second time,<br>then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.|Col4|

|20 Esther had not yet shewed her<br>kindred nor her people; as Mordecai<br>had charged her: for Esther did the<br>commandment of Mordecai, like as<br>when she was brought up with him.<br>21 ¶ In those days, while Morde-<br>cai sat in the king’s gate, two of the<br>king’s chamberlains, a Bigthan and<br>Teresh, of those which kept the<br>door, were wroth, and sought to<br>b lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.<br>22 And the thing was known to<br>a Mordecai, who told it unto Esther<br>the queen; and Esther certified the<br>king thereof in Mordecai’s name.<br>23 And when inquisition was made<br>of the matter, it was found out;<br>therefore they were both hanged<br>on a tree: and it was written in<br>the a book of the chronicles before<br>the king.<br>CHAPTER 3<br>Mordecai, the Jew, refuses to bow to<br>Haman—Haman arranges a decree to<br>kill all the Jews in the kingdom.<br>AFTER these things did king Ahas-<br>uerus a promote Haman the son of<br>b Hammedatha the Agagite, and ad-<br>vanced him, and set his seat above<br>all the princes that were with him.<br>2 And all the king’s servants, that<br>were in the king’s gate, a bowed, and<br>reverenced Haman: for the king had<br>so commanded concerning him.<br>But Mordecai bowed not, nor did<br>him reverence.<br>3 Then the king’s servants, which<br>were in the king’s gate, said unto<br>Mordecai, Why transgressest thou<br>the king’s commandment?<br>4 Now it came to pass, when they<br>spake daily unto him, and he heark-<br>ened not unto them, that they told<br>Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s<br>matters would stand: for he had<br>told them that he was a Jew.<br>5 And when Haman saw that<br>Mordecai a bowed not, nor did him|Col2|reverence, then was Haman full of<br>b wrath.<br>6 And he thought scorn to lay<br>hands on Mordecai alone; for they<br>had shewed him the people of Mor-<br>decai: wherefore Haman sought<br>to a destroy all the Jews that were<br>throughout the whole kingdom<br>of Ahasuerus, even the people of<br>Mordecai.<br>7 ¶ In the first month, that is, the<br>month Nisan, in the twelfth year of<br>king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that<br>is, the lot, before Haman from day<br>to day, and from month to month,<br>to the twelfth month, that is, the<br>month aA dar.<br>8 ¶ And Haman said unto king<br>Ahasuerus, There is a certain peo-<br>ple scattered abroad and dispersed<br>among the people in all the prov-<br>inces of thy kingdom; and their laws<br>are diverse from all people; neither<br>keep they the king’s laws: there-<br>fore it is not for the king’s profit to<br>suffer them.<br>9 If it please the king, let it be<br>written that they may be a destroyed:<br>and I will b pay ten thousand talents<br>of silver to the hands of those that<br>have the charge of the business, to<br>bring it into the king’s treasuries.<br>10 And the king took his a ring from<br>his hand, and gave it unto Haman<br>the son of Hammedatha the Aga-<br>gite, the Jews’ enemy.<br>11 And the king said unto Haman,<br>The silver is given to thee, the people<br>also, to do with them as it seemeth<br>good to thee.<br>12 Then were the king’s scribes<br>called on the thirteenth day of the<br>first month, and there was written<br>according to all that Haman had<br>commanded unto the king’s lieuten-<br>ants, and to the governors that were<br>over every province, and to the rul-<br>ers of every people of every province<br>according to the writing thereof,<br>and to every people after their|Col4|
