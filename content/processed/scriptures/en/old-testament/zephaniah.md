HABAKKUK 3:13–ZEPHANIAH 1:7 1162



13 Thou wentest forth for the
_**a**_ salvation of thy people, _even_ for
salvation with thine anointed; thou
_**b**_ woundedst the head out of the
house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck.
Selah.
14 Thou didst strike through with
his staves the head of his villages:
they came out as a whirlwind to
scatter me: their rejoicing _was_ as to
devour the poor secretly.
15 Thou didst walk through the sea
with thine horses, _through_ the _**[a ]**_ heap
of great waters.
16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:
rottenness entered into my bones,



and I trembled in myself, that I might
rest in the day of trouble: when he
cometh up unto the people, he will
invade them with his troops.
17 ¶ Although the fig tree shall
not blossom, neither _shall_ fruit _be_
in the vines; the labour of the olive
shall fail, and the fields shall yield
no meat; the flock shall be cut off
from the fold, and _there shall be_ no
herd in the stalls:
18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I
will joy in the God of my salvation.
19 The LORD God _is_ my _**[a ]**_ strength,
and he will make my feet like hinds’
_feet,_ and he will make me to walk
upon mine _**[b ]**_ high places. To the chief
singer on my stringed instruments.
