|CHAPTER 1<br>Jeremiah laments the miserable condi-<br>tion of Jerusalem—Jerusalem herself<br>complains of her deep sorrow.<br>H<br>OW doth the city sit solitary,<br>that was full of people! how is<br>she become as a a widow! she<br>that was great among the nations,<br>and b princess among the provinces,<br>how is she become tributary!<br>2 a She weepeth sore in the night,<br>and her tears are on her cheeks:<br>among all her b lovers she hath none<br>to c comfort her: all her friends have<br>dealt treacherously with her, they<br>are become her enemies.<br>3 Judah is gone into a captivity<br>because of affliction, and because<br>of great servitude: she dwelleth<br>among the heathen, she findeth no<br>b rest: all her persecutors overtook<br>her between the straits.<br>4 The ways of Zion do a mourn,<br>because none come to the b solemn<br>feasts: all her gates are desolate:|Col2|her priests sigh, her virgins are<br>afflicted, and she is in bitterness.<br>5 Her adversaries are the chief, her<br>enemies prosper; for the LORD hath<br>a afflicted her for the multitude of<br>her b transgressions: her children<br>are gone into captivity before the<br>enemy.<br>6 And from the daughter of Zion<br>all her a beauty is departed: her<br>princes are become like harts that<br>find no pasture, and they are gone<br>without strength before the pursuer.<br>7 Jerusalem remembered in the<br>days of her affliction and of her<br>miseries all her pleasant things that<br>she had in the days of old, when<br>her people fell into the hand of the<br>enemy, and none did help her: the<br>adversaries saw her, and did a mock<br>at her sabbaths.<br>8 a Jerusalem hath grievously<br>sinned; therefore she is b removed:<br>all that honoured her despise her,<br>because they have seen her c naked-<br>ness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth<br>backward.|Col4|
