JOB 42:10–PSALM 1:6 714



10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he _**[a ]**_ prayed for
his _**[b ]**_ friends: also the LORD gave Job
twice as much as he had before.
11 Then came there unto him all
his brethren, and all his sisters,
and all they that had been of his
acquaintance before, and did eat
bread with him in his house: and
they bemoaned him, and comforted
him over all the evil that the LORD
had brought upon him: every man
also gave him a piece of money, and
every one an earring of gold.
12 So the LORD _**[a ]**_ blessed the latter
end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand
sheep, and six thousand camels,



and a thousand yoke of oxen, and
a thousand she asses.
13 He had also seven sons and
three daughters.
14 And he called the name of the
first, Jemima; and the name of
the second, Kezia; and the name
of the third, Keren-happuch.
15 And in all the land were no
women found _so_ fair as the daughters
of Job: and their father gave them
inheritance among their brethren.
16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
sons, and his sons’ sons, _even_ four
generations.
17 So Job died, _being_ old and full
of days.
