2 KINGS 25:25–1 CHRONICLES 1:15 548



them, Fear not to be the servants
of the Chaldees: dwell in the land,
and serve the king of Babylon; and
it shall be well with you.
25 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of
the seed royal, came, and ten men
with him, and smote Gedaliah, that
he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
26 And all the people, both small
and great, and the captains of the
armies, arose, and came to Egypt:
for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
27 ¶ And it came to pass in the
seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah,



in the twelfth month, on the seven
and twentieth _day_ of the month, _that_
Evil-merodach king of Babylon in
the year that he began to reign did
lift up the head of Jehoiachin king
of Judah out of prison;
28 And he spake _**[a ]**_ kindly to him,
and set his throne above the throne
of the kings that _were_ with him in
Babylon;
29 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of
his life.
30 And his allowance _was_ a continual allowance given him of the
king, a daily rate for every day, all
the days of his life.

|done? let thine hand, I pray thee,<br>O LORD my God, be on me, and on<br>my father’s house; but not on thy<br>people, that they should be plagued.<br>18 ¶ Then the a angel of the LORD<br>commanded Gad to say to David, that<br>David should go up, and set up an<br>altar unto the LORD in the b thresh-<br>ingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.<br>19 And David went up at the say-<br>ing of Gad, which he spake in the<br>name of the LORD.<br>20 And Ornan turned back, and<br>saw the angel; and his four sons<br>with him hid themselves. Now Or-<br>nan was threshing wheat.<br>21 And as David came to Ornan,<br>Ornan looked and saw David, and<br>went out of the threshingfloor, and<br>bowed himself to David with his<br>face to the ground.<br>22 Then David said to Ornan,<br>Grant me the place of this thresh-<br>ingfloor, that I may build an altar<br>therein unto the LORD: thou shalt<br>grant it me for the full price: that<br>the plague may be stayed from the<br>people.<br>23 And Ornan said unto David,<br>Take it to thee, and let my lord the<br>king do that which is good in his<br>eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for<br>burnt offerings, and the threshing<br>instruments for wood, and the wheat<br>for the meat offering; I give it all.<br>24 And king David said to Ornan,<br>Nay; but I will verily buy it for the<br>full price: for I will not take that<br>which is thine for the LORD, nor<br>offer burnt offerings without cost.<br>25 So David gave to Ornan for the<br>place a six hundred shekels of gold<br>by b weight.<br>26 And David built there an a altar<br>unto the LORD, and offered burnt<br>offerings and peace offerings, and<br>called upon the LORD; and he an-<br>swered him from heaven by b fire<br>upon the altar of burnt offering.|Col2|27 And the LORD commanded the<br>angel; and he put up his sword again<br>into the sheath thereof.<br>28 ¶ At that time when David saw<br>that the LORD had answered him<br>in the threshingfloor of Ornan the<br>Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.<br>29 For the a tabernacle of the LORD,<br>which Moses made in the wilder-<br>ness, and the altar of the burnt<br>offering, were at that season in the<br>high place at b Gibeon.<br>30 But David could not go before it<br>to inquire of God: for he was afraid<br>because of the sword of the angel<br>of the LORD.<br>CHAPTER 22<br>David prepares gold, silver, brass, iron,<br>stone, and cedar wood for the temple—<br>He charges Solomon to do the work of<br>building it.<br>THEN David said, This is the a house<br>of the LORD God, and this is the b al-<br>tar of the burnt offering for Israel.<br>2 And David commanded to gather<br>together the a strangers that were in<br>the b land of Israel; and he set ma-<br>sons to hew wrought stones to build<br>the house of God.<br>3 And David prepared iron in<br>abundance for the nails for the<br>doors of the gates, and for the join-<br>ings; and brass in abundance with-<br>out weight;<br>4 Also cedar trees in abundance:<br>for the Zidonians and they of Tyre<br>brought much a cedar wood to<br>David.<br>5 And David said, Solomon my<br>son is a young and tender, and the<br>house that is to be builded for the<br>LORD must be exceeding magnifical,<br>of fame and of glory throughout all<br>countries: I will therefore now make<br>preparation for it.
