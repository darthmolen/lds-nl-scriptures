587 1 CHRONICLES 29:23–2 CHRONICLES 1:6



23 Then _**[a ]**_ Solomon sat on the throne
of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and
all Israel obeyed him.
24 And all the princes, and the
mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.
25 And the LORD _**[a ]**_ magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
Israel, and bestowed upon him _such_
royal majesty as had not been on
any king before him in Israel.
26 ¶ Thus David the son of Jesse
reigned over all Israel.
27 And the time that he _**[a ]**_ reigned
over Israel _was_ forty years; seven



years reigned he in Hebron, and
thirty and three _years_ reigned he
in Jerusalem.
28 And he died in a good old age,
full of days, riches, and honour: and
Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
29 Now the acts of David the king,
first and last, behold, they _are_ written in the book of Samuel the seer,
and in the book of _**[a ]**_ Nathan the
prophet, and in the book of Gad
the _**[b ]**_ seer,
30 With all his reign and his might,
and the times that went over him,
and over Israel, and over all the
kingdoms of the countries.

|CHAPTER 1<br>The Lord honors Solomon before all<br>Israel—The Lord appears to him—Solo-<br>mon chooses and is given wisdom—<br>His kingdom is blessed with splendor<br>and riches.<br>A<br>ND Solomon the son of David<br>was strengthened in his king-<br>dom, and the LORD his God<br>was with him, and magnified him<br>exceedingly.<br>2 Then Solomon spake unto all Is-<br>rael, to the captains of thousands<br>and of hundreds, and to the judges,<br>and to every governor in all Israel,<br>the chief of the fathers.<br>3 So Solomon, and all the congre-<br>gation with him, went to the a high<br>place that was at Gibeon; for there|Col2|was the b tabernacle of the congre-<br>gation of God, which Moses the<br>servant of the LORD had made in<br>the wilderness.<br>4 But the a ark of God had David<br>brought up from Kirjath-jearim to<br>the place which David had prepared<br>for it: for he had pitched a tent for<br>it at Jerusalem.<br>5 Moreover the a brasen altar, that<br>Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of<br>Hur, had made, he put before the<br>tabernacle of the LORD: and Solo-<br>mon and the congregation sought<br>unto b it.<br>6 And Solomon went up thither to<br>the brasen altar before the LORD,<br>which was at the tabernacle of the<br>congregation, and offered a thou-<br>sand burnt offerings upon it.|Col4|

father, and his heavy yoke that
he put upon us, and we will serve
thee.
5 And he said unto them, Come
again unto me after three days.
And the people departed.
6 ¶ And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
before Solomon his father while
he yet lived, saying, What counsel
give ye _me_ to return answer to this
people?
7 And they spake unto him, saying,
If thou be kind to this people, and
please them, and speak good words
to them, they will be thy servants
for ever.
8 But he forsook the counsel which
the old men gave him, and took
counsel with the young men that
were brought up with him, that
stood before him.
9 And he said unto them, What
advice give ye that we may return
answer to this people, which have
spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did
put upon us?
10 And the young men that were
brought up with him spake unto
him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer
the people that spake unto thee,
saying, Thy father made our yoke
heavy, but make thou _it_ somewhat
lighter for us; thus shalt thou say
unto them, My little _finger_ shall be
thicker than my father’s loins.
11 For whereas my father put a
heavy yoke upon you, I will put
more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I _will_
_chastise you_ with scorpions.
12 So Jeroboam and all the people
came to Rehoboam on the third day,


**11** 1 _a_ 1 Kgs. 12:21 (21–33).



as the king bade, saying, Come again
to me on the third day.
13 And the king answered them
roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
14 And answered them after the
advice of the young men, saying,
My father made your yoke heavy,
but I will add thereto: my father
chastised you with whips, but I _will_
_chastise you_ with scorpions.
15 So the king hearkened not unto
the people: for the cause was of God,
that the LORD might perform his
word, which he spake by the hand
of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam
the son of Nebat.
16 ¶ And when all Israel _saw_ that
the king would not hearken unto
them, the people answered the king,
saying, What portion have we in David? and _we have_ none inheritance
in the son of Jesse: every man to
your tents, O Israel: _and_ now, David, see to thine own house. So all
Israel went to their tents.
17 But _as for_ the children of Israel
that dwelt in the cities of Judah,
Rehoboam reigned over them.
18 Then king Rehoboam sent
Hadoram that _was_ over the tribute;
and the children of Israel stoned
him with stones, that he died. But
king Rehoboam made speed to get
him up to _his_ chariot, to flee to
Jerusalem.
19 And Israel rebelled against the
house of David unto this day.


CHAPTER 11


_Rehoboam strengthens the kingdom_
_of Judah but is forbidden to subdue_
_Israel—Jeroboam leads the kingdom_
_of Israel into idolatry—Rehoboam takes_
_many wives and concubines._


AND when _**[a ]**_ Rehoboam was come to
Jerusalem, he gathered of the house
of Judah and Benjamin an hundred
and fourscore thousand chosen
_men,_ which were warriors, to fight
against Israel, that he might bring
the kingdom again to Rehoboam.


2 CHRONICLES 11:2–12:1 600












|2 But the word of the LORD came<br>to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,<br>3 Speak unto Rehoboam the son<br>of Solomon, king of Judah, and to<br>all Israel in Judah and Benjamin,<br>saying,<br>4 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall<br>not go up, nor fight against your<br>brethren: return every man to his<br>house: for this thing is done of me.<br>And they obeyed the words of the<br>LORD, and returned from going<br>against Jeroboam.<br>5 ¶ And Rehoboam dwelt in Jeru-<br>salem, and built cities for a defence<br>in Judah.<br>6 He built even Beth-lehem, and<br>Etam, and Tekoa,<br>7 And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and<br>Adullam,<br>8 And Gath, and Mareshah, and<br>Ziph,<br>9 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and<br>Azekah,<br>10 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and<br>Hebron, which are in Judah and in<br>Benjamin fenced cities.<br>11 And he fortified the strong<br>holds, and put captains in them, and<br>store of victual, and of oil and wine.<br>12 And in every several city he put<br>shields and spears, and made them<br>exceeding strong, having Judah and<br>Benjamin on his side.<br>13 ¶ And the priests and the Lev-<br>ites that were in all Israel a resorted<br>to him out of all their b coasts.<br>14 For the Levites left their a sub-<br>urbs and their b possession, and<br>came to Judah and Jerusalem: for<br>Jeroboam and his sons had c cast<br>them off from executing the priest’s<br>office unto the LORD:<br>15 And he ordained him a priests<br>for the high places, and for the<br>b devils, and for the calves which he<br>had made.<br>16 And after them out of all the<br>tribes of Israel such as set their|Col2|hearts to seek the LORD God of<br>Israel came to Jerusalem, to sac-<br>rifice unto the LORD God of their<br>fathers.<br>17 So they strengthened the king-<br>dom of Judah, and made Rehoboam<br>the son of Solomon strong, three<br>years: for three years they walked<br>in the way of David and Solomon.<br>18 ¶ And Rehoboam took him Ma-<br>halath the daughter of Jerimoth the<br>son of David to wife, and Abihail the<br>daughter of a Eliab the son of Jesse;<br>19 Which bare him children; Jeush,<br>and Shamariah, and Zaham.<br>20 And after her he took a Maachah<br>the daughter of Absalom; which<br>bare him Abijah, and Attai, and<br>Ziza, and Shelomith.<br>21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah<br>the daughter of Absalom above<br>all his wives and his concubines:<br>(for he took eighteen wives, and<br>threescore concubines; and begat<br>twenty and eight sons, and three-<br>score daughters.)<br>22 And Rehoboam made Abijah<br>the son of Maachah the chief, to be<br>ruler among his brethren: for he<br>thought to make him king.<br>23 And he dealt wisely, and dis-<br>persed of all his a children through-<br>out all the countries of Judah and<br>Benjamin, unto every fenced city:<br>and he gave them victual in abun-<br>dance.

The same time also did Libnah<br>revolt from under his hand; because<br>he had forsaken the LORD God of<br>his fathers.<br>11 Moreover he made high places<br>in the mountains of Judah, and<br>caused the inhabitants of Jerusa-<br>lem to a commit fornication, and<br>b compelled Judah thereto.<br>12 ¶ And there came a writing to|Col2|him from Elijah the prophet, saying,<br>Thus saith the LORD God of David<br>thy father, Because thou hast not<br>walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat<br>thy father, nor in the ways of aA sa<br>king of Judah,<br>13 But hast walked in the way of<br>the kings of Israel, and hast made<br>Judah and the inhabitants of Jeru-<br>salem to go a whoring, like to the<br>whoredoms of the house of Ahab,<br>and also hast slain thy brethren of<br>thy father’s house, which were better<br>than thyself:<br>14 Behold, with a great a plague<br>will the LORD smite thy people,<br>and thy children, and thy wives,<br>and all thy goods:<br>15 And thou shalt have great sick-<br>ness by disease of thy bowels, until<br>thy bowels fall out by reason of the<br>sickness day by day.<br>16 ¶ Moreover the LORD stirred up<br>against Jehoram the spirit of the<br>Philistines, and of the aA rabians,<br>that were near the Ethiopians:<br>17 And they came up into Judah,<br>and brake into it, and carried away<br>all the substance that was found in<br>the king’s house, and his sons also,<br>and his wives; so that there was<br>never a son left him, save a Jehoa-<br>haz, the youngest of his sons.<br>18 ¶ And after all this the LORD<br>smote him in his bowels with an<br>incurable disease.<br>19 And it came to pass, that in pro-<br>cess of time, after the end of two<br>years, his bowels fell out by reason<br>of his sickness: so he died of sore<br>diseases. And his people made no<br>a burning for him, like the burning<br>of his fathers.<br>20 Thirty and two years old was<br>he when he began to reign, and he<br>reigned in Jerusalem eight years,<br>and departed without being desired.<br>Howbeit they buried him in the city<br>of David, but not in the a sepulchres<br>of the kings.|Col4|

|CHAPTER 22<br>Ahaziah reigns in wickedness and is<br>slain by Jehu; his mother, Athaliah,<br>reigns in his stead.<br>AND the inhabitants of Jerusalem<br>made Ahaziah his youngest son<br>king in his stead: for the band of<br>men that came with the aA rabians<br>to the camp had slain all the eldest.<br>So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king<br>of Judah reigned.<br>2 a Forty and two years old was<br>bA haziah when he began to reign,<br>and he reigned one year in Jeru-<br>salem. His mother’s name also was<br>Athaliah the c daughter of Omri.<br>3 He also walked in the ways of<br>the house of aA hab: for his b mother<br>was his counsellor to do wickedly.<br>4 Wherefore he did evil in the<br>sight of the LORD like the house of<br>Ahab: for they were his counsellors<br>after the death of his father to his<br>destruction.<br>5 ¶ He walked also after their<br>counsel, and went with a Jehoram<br>the son of Ahab king of Israel to<br>war against Hazael king of Syria<br>at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians<br>smote Joram.<br>6 And he returned to be healed<br>in Jezreel because of the wounds<br>which were given him at Ramah,<br>when he fought with Hazael king<br>of Syria. And aA zariah the son of<br>Jehoram king of Judah went down<br>to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at<br>Jezreel, because he was sick.<br>7 And the destruction of Ahaziah<br>was of God by coming to Joram: for<br>when he was come, he went out with<br>Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nim-<br>shi, whom the LORD had a anointed<br>to cut off the house of Ahab.<br>8 And it came to pass, that, when<br>Jehu was executing judgment upon<br>the house of Ahab, and found the|Col2|princes of Judah, and the sons of<br>the brethren of Ahaziah, that min-<br>istered to Ahaziah, he slew them.<br>9 And he sought Ahaziah: and they<br>caught him, (for he was hid in Sa-<br>maria,) and brought him to Jehu:<br>and when they had a slain him, they<br>buried him: Because, said they, he is<br>the b son of Jehoshaphat, who sought<br>the LORD with all his heart. So the<br>house of Ahaziah had no power to<br>keep still the kingdom.<br>10 ¶ But when aA thaliah the<br>mother of Ahaziah saw that her son<br>was dead, she arose and destroyed all<br>the seed royal of the house of Judah.<br>11 But Jehoshabeath, the daugh-<br>ter of the king, took Joash the son<br>of Ahaziah, and stole him from<br>among the king’s sons that were<br>slain, and put him and his nurse in<br>a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the<br>daughter of king Jehoram, the wife<br>of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was<br>the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from<br>Athaliah, so that she slew him not.<br>12 And he was with them hid in<br>the house of God six years: and<br>Athaliah reigned over the land.<br>CHAPTER 23<br>Jehoiada the priest makes Joash king—<br>Athaliah is slain—Worship of the Lord is<br>restored, and the priest of Baal is slain.<br>AND in the seventh year Jehoiada<br>strengthened himself, and took the<br>captains of hundreds, Azariah the<br>son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son<br>of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son<br>of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of<br>Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of<br>Zichri, into a covenant with him.<br>2 And they went about in Judah,<br>and gathered the Levites out of all<br>the cities of Judah, and the chief of<br>the fathers of Israel, and they came<br>to Jerusalem.|Col4|

And Jehoiada and|Col2|his sons anointed him, and said,<br>God save the king.<br>12 ¶ Now when Athaliah heard<br>the noise of the people running and<br>praising the king, she came to the<br>people into the house of the LORD:<br>13 And she looked, and, behold,<br>the king stood at his pillar at the<br>entering in, and the princes and<br>the trumpets by the king: and all<br>the people of the land rejoiced, and<br>sounded with trumpets, also the<br>singers with instruments of musick,<br>and such as taught to a sing praise.<br>Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and<br>said, Treason, Treason.<br>14 Then Jehoiada the priest<br>brought out the captains of hun-<br>dreds that were set over the host,<br>and said unto them, Have her forth<br>a of the ranges: and whoso followeth<br>her, let him be slain with the sword.<br>For the priest said, Slay her not in<br>the house of the LORD.<br>15 So they laid hands on her; and<br>when she was come to the enter-<br>ing of the a horse gate by the king’s<br>house, they slew her there.<br>16 ¶ And Jehoiada made a cov-<br>enant between him, and between<br>all the people, and between the<br>king, that they should be the LORD’s<br>people.<br>17 Then all the people went to the<br>house of Baal, and brake it down,<br>and brake his altars and his images<br>in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest<br>of Baal before the altars.<br>18 Also Jehoiada appointed the<br>offices of the house of the LORD<br>by the hand of the priests the Lev-<br>ites, whom David had distributed<br>in the house of the LORD, to offer<br>the a burnt offerings of the LORD,<br>as it is written in the law of Moses,<br>with rejoicing and with singing, as<br>it was ordained by David.<br>19 And he set the porters at the<br>gates of the house of the LORD, that<br>none which was unclean in any thing<br>should enter in.|Col4|

|David and to Solomon his son, In<br>this house, and in Jerusalem, which<br>I have chosen before all the tribes of<br>Israel, will I put my name for ever:<br>8 Neither will I any more remove<br>the foot of Israel from out of the land<br>which I have appointed for your<br>fathers; so that they will take heed<br>to do all that I have commanded<br>them, according to the whole law<br>and the statutes and the ordinances<br>by the hand of Moses.<br>9 So Manasseh made Judah and<br>the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err,<br>and to do a worse than the b heathen,<br>whom the LORD had destroyed be-<br>fore the children of Israel.<br>10 And the LORD spake to Ma-<br>nasseh, and to his people: but they<br>would not a hearken.<br>11 ¶ Wherefore the LORD brought<br>upon them the captains of the host<br>of the king of Assyria, which took<br>Manasseh a among the thorns, and<br>bound him with fetters, and carried<br>him to Babylon.<br>12 And when he was in a affliction,<br>he b besought the LORD his God, and<br>c humbled himself greatly before<br>the God of his fathers,<br>13 And prayed unto him: and he<br>was a entreated of him, and heard<br>his supplication, and brought him<br>again to Jerusalem into his king-<br>dom.
