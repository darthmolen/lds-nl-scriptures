|CHAPTER 1<br>Hannah prays for a son and vows to<br>give him to the Lord—Eli the priest<br>blesses her—Samuel is born—Hannah<br>loans him to the Lord.<br>N<br>OW there was a certain man<br>of a Ramathaim-zophim, of<br>mount Ephraim, and his<br>name was b Elkanah, the son of<br>Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son<br>of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Eph-<br>rathite:<br>2 And he had two wives; the name<br>of the one was Hannah, and the<br>name of the other Peninnah: and<br>Peninnah had children, but Han-<br>nah had a no children.<br>3 And this man went up out of<br>his city a yearly to worship and to<br>sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in<br>b Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,<br>Hophni and Phinehas, the priests<br>of the LORD, were there.<br>4 ¶ And when the time was that<br>Elkanah offered, he gave to Penin-<br>nah his wife, and to all her sons and<br>her daughters, portions:<br>5 But unto Hannah he gave a<br>worthy portion; for he loved Han-<br>nah: but the LORD had shut up her<br>womb.<br>6 And her adversary also a pro-<br>voked her sore, for to make her<br>fret, because the LORD had shut up<br>her womb.<br>7 And as he did so year by year,<br>when she went up to the a house|Col2|of the LORD, so she provoked her;<br>therefore she wept, and did not eat.<br>8 Then said Elkanah her husband<br>to her, Hannah, why weepest thou?<br>and why eatest thou not? and why<br>is thy heart grieved? am not I bet-<br>ter to thee than ten sons?<br>9 ¶ So Hannah rose up after they<br>had eaten in Shiloh, and after<br>they had drunk. Now Eli the priest<br>sat upon a a seat by a post of the<br>temple of the LORD.<br>10 And she was in a bitterness of<br>soul, and prayed unto the LORD,<br>and wept sore.<br>11 And she a vowed a b vow, and<br>said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt<br>indeed look on the affliction of<br>thine c handmaid, and remember<br>me, and not forget thine handmaid,<br>but wilt give unto thine handmaid<br>a man child, then I will give him<br>unto the LORD all the days of his<br>life, and there shall no d razor come<br>upon his head.<br>12 And it came to pass, as she con-<br>tinued praying before the LORD,<br>that Eli a marked her mouth.<br>13 Now Hannah, she spake in her<br>heart; only her lips moved, but her<br>voice was not heard: therefore Eli<br>thought she had been drunken.<br>14 And Eli said unto her, How long<br>wilt thou be drunken? put away thy<br>wine from thee.<br>15 And Hannah answered and said,<br>No, my lord, I am a woman of a sor-<br>rowful spirit: I have drunk neither|Col4|

|wine nor strong drink, but have<br>a poured out my soul before the<br>LORD.<br>16 Count not thine handmaid for<br>a a daughter of b Belial: for out of<br>the abundance of my complaint<br>and grief have I spoken hitherto.<br>17 Then Eli answered and said,<br>Go in peace: and the God of Israel<br>grant thee thy petition that thou<br>hast asked of him.<br>18 And she said, Let thine hand-<br>maid find grace in thy sight. So<br>the woman went her way, and did<br>eat, and her countenance was no<br>more sad.<br>19 ¶ And they rose up in the morn-<br>ing early, and worshipped before<br>the LORD, and returned, and came<br>to their house to a Ramah: and Elka-<br>nah knew Hannah his wife; and the<br>LORD b remembered her.<br>20 Wherefore it came to pass, when<br>the time was come about after Han-<br>nah had conceived, that she bare a<br>a son, and called his name Samuel,<br>saying, Because I have asked him<br>of the LORD.<br>21 And the man Elkanah, and all<br>his house, went up to offer unto<br>the LORD the a yearly sacrifice, and<br>his vow.<br>22 But Hannah went not up; for<br>she said unto her husband, I will<br>not go up until the child be weaned,<br>and then I will bring him, that he<br>may appear before the LORD, and<br>there abide for ever.<br>23 And Elkanah her husband said<br>unto her, Do what seemeth thee<br>good; tarry until thou have weaned<br>him; only the LORD establish his<br>word. So the woman abode, and<br>gave her son suck until she weaned<br>him.|Col2|24 ¶ And when she had weaned<br>him, she took him up with her,<br>with three bullocks, and one ephah<br>of flour, and a bottle of wine, and<br>brought him unto the house of the<br>LORD in Shiloh: and the child was<br>young.<br>25 And they slew a bullock, and<br>brought the child to Eli.<br>26 And she said, Oh my lord, as<br>thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the<br>woman that stood by thee here,<br>praying unto the LORD.<br>27 For this a child I prayed; and<br>the LORD hath given me my peti-<br>tion which I asked of him:<br>28 Therefore also I have lent him<br>to the LORD; as long as he liveth he<br>shall be a lent to the LORD. And he<br>worshipped the LORD there.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>Hannah sings praises to the Lord—<br>Samuel ministers before the Lord—Eli<br>blesses Elkanah and Hannah, and<br>they have sons and daughters—The<br>sons of Eli reject the Lord and live in<br>wickedness—The Lord rejects the house<br>of Eli.<br>AND Hannah a prayed, and said,<br>My heart b rejoiceth in the LORD,<br>mine c horn is exalted in the LORD:<br>my mouth is enlarged over mine<br>enemies; because I rejoice in thy<br>d salvation.<br>2 There is a none holy as the LORD:<br>for there is none beside thee: nei-<br>ther is there any b rock like our God.<br>3 Talk no more so exceeding<br>proudly; let not arrogancy come<br>out of your mouth: for the LORD is<br>a God of a knowledge, and by him<br>b actions are weighed.<br>4 The bows of the mighty men are|Col4|

So they did in<br>Shiloh unto all the Israelites that<br>came thither.<br>15 Also before they burnt the fat,<br>the priest’s servant came, and said<br>to the man that sacrificed, Give<br>flesh to roast for the priest; for he<br>will not have a sodden flesh of thee,<br>but raw.<br>16 And if any man said unto him,<br>Let them not fail to burn the fat<br>a presently, and then take as much<br>as thy soul desireth; then he would<br>answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give<br>it me now: and if not, I will take it<br>by force.<br>17 Wherefore the sin of the young<br>men was very great before the LORD:<br>for men a abhorred the offering of<br>the LORD.<br>18 ¶ But Samuel ministered before<br>the LORD, being a child, girded with<br>a linen a ephod.<br>19 Moreover his a mother made him<br>a little coat, and brought it to him<br>from year to year, when she came<br>up with her husband to offer the<br>yearly sacrifice.<br>20 ¶ And Eli a blessed Elkanah and<br>his wife, and said, The LORD give<br>thee seed of this woman for b the<br>loan which is c lent to the LORD. And<br>they went unto their own home.<br>21 And the LORD a visited Hannah,<br>so that she conceived, and bare<br>three sons and two daughters. And|Col4|

|the child Samuel grew before the<br>LORD.<br>22 ¶ Now Eli was very old, and<br>heard all that his sons did unto all<br>Israel; and how they lay with the<br>women that assembled at the door of<br>the tabernacle of the congregation.<br>23 And he said unto them, Why do<br>ye such things? for I hear of your<br>evil dealings by all this people.<br>24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good<br>report that I hear: ye make the<br>LORD’s people to a transgress.<br>25 If one man sin against another,<br>the judge shall a judge him: but if a<br>man sin against the LORD, who shall<br>entreat for him? Notwithstanding<br>they hearkened not unto the voice<br>of their father, because the LORD<br>would slay them.<br>26 And the child Samuel a grew on,<br>and was in b favour both with the<br>LORD, and also with men.<br>27 ¶ And there came a man of God<br>unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus<br>saith the LORD, Did I plainly ap-<br>pear unto the house of thy father,<br>when they were in Egypt in Pha-<br>raoh’s house?<br>28 And did I a choose him out of all<br>the tribes of Israel to be my priest,<br>to offer upon mine altar, to burn<br>incense, to wear an b ephod before<br>me? and did I give unto the house<br>of thy father all the c offerings made<br>by fire of the children of Israel?<br>29 Wherefore a kick ye at my sac-<br>rifice and at mine offering, which I<br>have commanded in my habitation;<br>and b honourest thy sons above me,<br>to make yourselves fat with the<br>chiefest of all the offerings of Is-<br>rael my people?<br>30 Wherefore the LORD God of<br>Israel saith, I said indeed that thy|Col2|house, and the a house of thy father,<br>should b walk before me for ever: but<br>now the LORD saith, Be it far from<br>me; for them that c honour me I will<br>honour, and they that despise me<br>shall be lightly d esteemed.<br>31 Behold, the a days come, that I<br>will b cut off thine arm, and the arm<br>of thy father’s house, that there shall<br>not be an old man in thine house.<br>32 And thou shalt see an enemy<br>in my habitation, in all the wealth<br>which God shall give Israel: and<br>there shall not be an old man in<br>thine house for ever.<br>33 And the man of thine, whom I<br>shall not cut off from mine altar,<br>shall be to consume thine eyes, and<br>to grieve thine heart: and all the<br>increase of thine house shall die<br>in the flower of their age.<br>34 And this shall be a sign unto<br>thee, that shall come upon thy two<br>sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in<br>one day they shall a die both of them.<br>35 And I will a raise me up a faith-<br>ful b priest, that shall do according<br>to that which is in mine heart and<br>in my mind: and c I will build him<br>a sure house; and he shall walk be-<br>fore mine anointed for ever.<br>36 And it shall come to pass, that<br>every one that is left in thine house<br>shall come and crouch to him for a<br>piece of silver and a morsel of bread,<br>and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,<br>into one of the priests’ offices, that<br>I may eat a piece of bread.<br>CHAPTER 3<br>The Lord calls Samuel—The house of Eli<br>will not be purged by sacrifices and offer-<br>ings—Samuel is recognized as a prophet<br>by all Israel—The Lord appears to him.|Col4|

|AND the child Samuel ministered<br>unto the LORD before Eli. And the<br>word of the LORD was precious<br>in those days; there was no open<br>a vision.<br>2 And it came to pass at that time,<br>when Eli was laid down in his place,<br>and his a eyes began to wax dim,<br>that he could not see;<br>3 And ere the a lamp of God went<br>out in the temple of the LORD, where<br>the ark of God was, and Samuel was<br>laid down to sleep;<br>4 That the LORD called Samuel:<br>and he answered, Here am I.<br>5 And he ran unto Eli, and said,<br>Here am I; for thou calledst me.<br>And he said, I called not; lie down<br>again. And he went and lay down.<br>6 And the LORD called yet again,<br>Samuel. And Samuel arose and went<br>to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou<br>didst call me. And he answered, I<br>called not, my son; lie down again.<br>7 Now Samuel did not yet know<br>the LORD, neither was the word of<br>the LORD yet revealed unto him.<br>8 And the LORD called Samuel<br>again the third time. And he arose<br>and went to Eli, and said, Here am<br>I; for thou didst call me. And Eli<br>perceived that the LORD had called<br>the child.<br>9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel,<br>Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he<br>call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak,<br>LORD; for thy servant heareth. So<br>Samuel went and lay down in his<br>place.<br>10 And the LORD came, and a stood,<br>and called as at other times, Samuel,<br>Samuel. Then Samuel answered,<br>Speak; for thy b servant heareth.<br>11 ¶ And the LORD said to Samuel,|Col2|Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,<br>at which both the ears of every one<br>that heareth it shall a tingle.<br>12 In that day I will perform<br>a against Eli all things which I have<br>spoken concerning his house: when<br>I begin, I will also make an end.<br>13 For I have told him that I will<br>a judge his house for ever for the in-<br>iquity which he knoweth; because<br>his b sons made themselves vile, and<br>he c restrained them not.<br>14 And therefore I have sworn unto<br>the house of Eli, that the iniquity<br>of Eli’s house shall not be purged<br>with sacrifice nor offering for ever.<br>15 ¶ And Samuel lay until the<br>morning, and opened the doors of<br>the house of the LORD. And Samuel<br>a feared to shew Eli the vision.<br>16 Then Eli called Samuel, and<br>said, Samuel, my son. And he an-<br>swered, Here am I.<br>17 And he said, What is the thing<br>that the LORD hath said unto thee? I<br>pray thee hide it not from me: God<br>do so to thee, and more also, if thou<br>hide any thing from me of all the<br>things that he said unto thee.<br>18 And Samuel told him every<br>whit, and hid nothing from him.<br>And he said, It is the LORD: let him<br>do what seemeth him good.<br>19 ¶ And Samuel a grew, and the<br>b LORD was c with him, and did let<br>none of his words d fall to the ground.<br>20 And all Israel from Dan even<br>to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel<br>was a established to be a prophet of<br>the LORD.<br>21 And the LORD a appeared again<br>in b Shiloh: for the LORD revealed<br>himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the<br>c word of the LORD.|Col4|

|CHAPTER 4<br>The Israelites are smitten and defeated<br>by the Philistines, who also capture the<br>ark of God—Eli’s sons are slain, Eli<br>dies in an accident, and his daughter-<br>in-law dies in childbirth.<br>AND the word of Samuel came to all<br>Israel. Now Israel went out against<br>the Philistines to battle, and pitched<br>beside a Eben-ezer: and the Philis-<br>tines pitched in bA phek.<br>2 And the Philistines put them-<br>selves in array against Israel: and<br>when they joined battle, Israel was<br>smitten before the Philistines: and<br>they slew of the army in the field<br>about four thousand men.<br>3 ¶ And when the people were<br>come into the camp, the elders of<br>Israel said, Wherefore hath the<br>LORD smitten us to day before the<br>Philistines? Let us fetch the a ark<br>of the covenant of the LORD out of<br>Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh<br>among us, it may save us out of the<br>hand of our enemies.<br>4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that<br>they might bring from thence the<br>ark of the covenant of the LORD of<br>hosts, which dwelleth between the<br>a cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,<br>Hophni and Phinehas, were there<br>with the ark of the covenant of God.<br>5 And when the ark of the covenant<br>of the LORD came into the camp, all<br>Israel shouted with a great shout,<br>so that the earth rang again.<br>6 And when the Philistines heard<br>the noise of the shout, they said,<br>What meaneth the noise of this great<br>shout in the camp of the Hebrews?<br>And they understood that the ark of<br>the LORD was come into the camp.<br>7 And the Philistines were afraid,<br>for they said, God is come into the<br>camp. And they said, Woe unto us!<br>for there hath not been such a thing<br>heretofore.<br>8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver|Col2|us out of the hand of these a mighty<br>Gods? these are the Gods that smote<br>the Egyptians with all the plagues<br>in the wilderness.<br>9 Be strong, and a quit yourselves<br>like b men, O ye Philistines, that ye<br>be not c servants unto the Hebrews,<br>as they have been to you: quit your-<br>selves like men, and fight.<br>10 ¶ And the Philistines fought,<br>and Israel was smitten, and they<br>fled every man into his tent: and<br>there was a very great slaughter;<br>for there fell of Israel thirty thou-<br>sand footmen.<br>11 And the ark of God was taken;<br>and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and<br>Phinehas, were a slain.<br>12 ¶ And there ran a man of Ben-<br>jamin out of the army, and came to<br>Shiloh the same day with his clothes<br>a rent, and with earth upon his head.<br>13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat<br>upon a seat by the wayside watch-<br>ing: for his heart trembled for the<br>ark of God. And when the man<br>came into the city, and told it, all<br>the city cried out.<br>14 And when Eli heard the noise<br>of the crying, he said, What meaneth<br>the noise of this tumult? And the<br>man came in hastily, and told Eli.<br>15 Now Eli was ninety and eight<br>years old; and his a eyes were dim,<br>that he could not see.<br>16 And the man said unto Eli, I am<br>he that came out of the army, and I<br>fled to day out of the army. And he<br>said, What is there done, my son?<br>17 And the messenger answered<br>and said, Israel is fled before the<br>Philistines, and there hath been also<br>a great slaughter among the people,<br>and thy two sons also, Hophni and<br>Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of<br>God is taken.<br>18 And it came to pass, when he<br>made mention of the ark of God,<br>that he fell from off the a seat back-<br>ward by the side of the gate, and his|Col4|

But she answered not,<br>neither did she regard it.<br>21 And she named the child a I-<br>chabod, saying, The glory is de-<br>parted from Israel: because the ark<br>of God was taken, and because of<br>her father in law and her husband.<br>22 And she said, The glory is de-<br>parted from Israel: for the ark of<br>God is taken.<br>CHAPTER 5<br>The Philistines place the ark in the<br>house of Dagon, their god—The Philis-<br>tines in Ashdod, then Gath, and then<br>Ekron are plagued and slain because<br>the ark is lodged with them.<br>AND the Philistines took the a ark<br>of God, and brought it from b Eben-<br>ezer unto Ashdod.<br>2 When the Philistines took the<br>a ark of God, they brought it into the<br>house of b Dagon, and set it by Dagon.<br>3 ¶ And when they of Ashdod<br>arose early on the morrow, behold,<br>Dagon was fallen upon his face to<br>the earth before the ark of the LORD.<br>And they took Dagon, and set him<br>in his place again.<br>4 And when they arose early on the<br>morrow morning, behold, Dagon was<br>fallen upon his face to the ground<br>before the ark of the LORD; and the<br>head of Dagon and both the palms<br>of his hands were cut off upon the|Col2|threshold; only the stump of Dagon<br>was left to him.<br>5 Therefore neither the priests<br>of Dagon, nor any that come into<br>Dagon’s house, tread on the thresh-<br>old of Dagon in Ashdod unto this<br>day.<br>6 But the hand of the LORD was<br>heavy upon them of Ashdod, and<br>he destroyed them, and smote them<br>with a emerods, even Ashdod and the<br>coasts thereof.<br>7 And when the men of Ashdod<br>saw that it was so, they said, The<br>ark of the God of Israel shall not<br>abide with us: for his hand is sore<br>upon us, and upon Dagon our god.<br>8 They sent therefore and gathered<br>all the lords of the Philistines unto<br>them, and said, What shall we do<br>with the ark of the God of Israel?<br>And they answered, Let the ark of<br>the God of Israel be carried about<br>unto a Gath. And they carried the<br>ark of the God of Israel about thither.<br>9 And it was so, that, after they<br>had carried it about, the a hand of<br>the LORD was against the city with a<br>very great destruction: and he smote<br>the men of the city, both small and<br>great, and they had emerods in their<br>secret parts.<br>10 ¶ Therefore they sent the ark of<br>God to Ekron.

So they<br>went unto the city where the man<br>of God was.<br>11 ¶ And as they went up the hill<br>to the city, they found young maid-<br>ens going out to draw water, and<br>said unto them, Is the seer here?<br>12 And they answered them, and<br>said, He is; behold, he is a before you:<br>make haste now, for he came to day<br>to the city; for there is a sacrifice of<br>the people to day in the high place:<br>13 As soon as ye be come into the<br>city, ye shall straightway find him,<br>before he go up to the high place to<br>eat: for the people will not eat until<br>he come, because he doth bless<br>the sacrifice; and afterwards they<br>eat that be bidden. Now therefore<br>get you up; for about this time ye<br>shall find him.<br>14 And they went up into the<br>city: and when they were come into<br>the city, behold, Samuel came out<br>a against them, for to go up to the<br>high place.<br>15 ¶ Now the a LORD had b told<br>Samuel in his ear a day before Saul<br>came, saying,<br>16 To morrow about this time I will<br>send thee a man out of the land of<br>Benjamin, and thou shalt a anoint<br>him to be captain over my people<br>Israel, that he may save my people<br>out of the hand of the Philistines:<br>for I have looked upon my people,<br>because their b cry is come unto me.<br>17 And when Samuel saw Saul,<br>the LORD said unto him, Behold the<br>man whom I spake to thee of! this<br>same shall reign over my people.<br>18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel<br>in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray<br>thee, where the seer’s house is.|Col2|19 And Samuel answered Saul,<br>and said, I am the a seer: go up be-<br>fore me unto the high place; for<br>ye shall eat with me to day, and to<br>morrow I will let thee go, and will<br>tell thee all that is in thine heart.<br>20 And as for thine asses that<br>were lost three days ago, set not thy<br>mind on them; for they are found.<br>And on whom is all the desire of<br>Israel?

And Saul said, Because<br>I saw that the people were scattered<br>from me, and that thou camest not<br>within the days appointed, and that<br>the Philistines gathered themselves<br>together at Michmash;|Col2|12 Therefore said I, The Philistines<br>will come down now upon me to<br>Gilgal, and I have not made sup-<br>plication unto the LORD: I a forced<br>myself therefore, and offered a<br>burnt offering.<br>13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou<br>hast done foolishly: thou hast not<br>kept the commandment of the LORD<br>thy God, which he commanded<br>thee: for now would the LORD have<br>established thy kingdom upon Is-<br>rael for ever.<br>14 But now thy a kingdom shall not<br>continue: the LORD hath b sought him<br>a c man after his own d heart, and<br>the LORD hath commanded him to<br>be captain over his people, because<br>thou hast not kept that which the<br>LORD commanded thee.<br>15 And Samuel arose, and gat<br>him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of<br>Benjamin. And Saul numbered the<br>people that were present with him,<br>about six hundred men.<br>16 And Saul, and Jonathan his<br>son, and the people that were pres-<br>ent with them, abode in Gibeah of<br>Benjamin: but the Philistines en-<br>camped in Michmash.<br>17 ¶ And the spoilers came out of<br>the camp of the Philistines in three<br>companies: one company turned<br>unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah,<br>unto the land of Shual:<br>18 And another company turned<br>the way to Beth-horon: and another<br>company turned to the way of the<br>border that looketh to the valley<br>of Zeboim toward the wilderness.<br>19 ¶ Now there was no a smith found<br>throughout all the land of Israel: for<br>the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews<br>make them swords or spears:<br>20 But all the Israelites went down<br>to the Philistines, to sharpen every<br>man his a share, and his b coulter, and<br>his axe, and his mattock.|Col4|

But he told not<br>his father.<br>2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost<br>part of Gibeah under a pomegran-<br>ate tree which is in Migron: and<br>the people that were with him were<br>about six hundred men;<br>3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub,<br>I-chabod’s brother, the son of Phin-<br>ehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’s priest<br>in Shiloh, wearing an a ephod. And<br>the people knew not that Jonathan<br>was gone.<br>4 ¶ And between the a passages, by<br>which Jonathan sought to go over<br>unto the Philistines’ garrison, there<br>was a sharp rock on the one side,<br>and a sharp rock on the other side:<br>and the name of the one was Bozez,<br>and the name of the other Seneh.<br>5 The forefront of the one was<br>situate northward over against|Col2|Michmash, and the other southward<br>over against Gibeah.<br>6 And Jonathan said to the young<br>man that bare his armour, Come,<br>and let us go over unto the garrison<br>of these uncircumcised: it may be<br>that the LORD will work for us: for<br>there is no a restraint to the LORD to<br>save by many or by b few.<br>7 And his armourbearer said unto<br>him, Do all that is in thine heart:<br>a turn thee; behold, I am with thee<br>according to thy heart.<br>8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we<br>will pass over unto these men, and we<br>will discover ourselves unto them.<br>9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry<br>until we come to you; then we will<br>stand still in our place, and will not<br>go up unto them.<br>10 But if they say thus, Come up<br>unto us; then we will go up: for<br>the LORD hath delivered them into<br>our hand: and this shall be a sign<br>unto us.<br>11 And both of them a discovered<br>themselves unto the garrison of the<br>Philistines: and the Philistines said,<br>Behold, the Hebrews come forth<br>out of the b holes where they had<br>hid themselves.<br>12 And the men of the garrison<br>answered Jonathan and his ar-<br>mourbearer, and said, Come up to<br>us, and we will shew you a thing.<br>And Jonathan said unto his armour-<br>bearer, Come up after me: for the<br>LORD hath a delivered them into the<br>hand of Israel.<br>13 And Jonathan climbed up upon<br>his hands and upon his feet, and<br>his armourbearer after him: and<br>they fell before Jonathan; and his<br>armourbearer slew after him.<br>14 And that first slaughter, which<br>Jonathan and his armourbearer<br>made, was about twenty men, within<br>as it were an half acre of land, which<br>a yoke of oxen might plow.<br>15 And there was trembling in the|Col4|

And<br>when they had numbered, behold,<br>Jonathan and his armourbearer<br>were not there.<br>18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring<br>hither the ark of God. For the a ark<br>of God was at that time with the<br>children of Israel.<br>19 ¶ And it came to pass, while<br>Saul talked unto the priest, that<br>the noise that was in the host of the<br>Philistines went on and increased:<br>and Saul said unto the priest, With-<br>draw thine hand.<br>20 And Saul and all the people<br>that were with him assembled them-<br>selves, and they came to the battle:<br>and, behold, every man’s sword was<br>against his a fellow, and there was a<br>very great b discomfiture.<br>21 Moreover the a Hebrews that<br>were with the Philistines before<br>that time, which went up with them<br>into the camp from the country round<br>about, even they also turned to be<br>with the Israelites that were with<br>Saul and Jonathan.<br>22 Likewise all the men of Israel<br>which had a hid themselves in mount<br>Ephraim, when they heard that the<br>Philistines fled, even they also fol-<br>lowed hard after them in the battle.<br>23 So the LORD saved Israel that<br>day: and the battle passed over unto<br>Beth-aven.<br>24 ¶ And the men of Israel were<br>distressed that day: for Saul had ad-<br>jured the people, saying, Cursed be<br>the man that eateth any food until|Col2|evening, that I may be avenged on<br>mine enemies. So none of the peo-<br>ple tasted any food.<br>25 And all they of the land came to<br>a wood; and there was honey upon<br>the ground.<br>26 And when the people were come<br>into the wood, behold, the honey<br>dropped; but no man put his hand<br>to his mouth: for the people feared<br>the oath.<br>27 But Jonathan heard not when<br>his father charged the people with<br>the oath: wherefore he put forth the<br>end of the rod that was in his hand,<br>and dipped it in an honeycomb, and<br>put his hand to his mouth; and his<br>eyes were a enlightened.<br>28 Then answered one of the peo-<br>ple, and said, Thy father a straitly<br>charged the people with an oath,<br>saying, Cursed be the man that eat-<br>eth any food this day. And the peo-<br>ple were faint.<br>29 Then said Jonathan, My father<br>hath troubled the land: see, I pray<br>you, how mine eyes have been en-<br>lightened, because I tasted a little<br>of this honey.<br>30 How much more, if a haply the<br>people had eaten freely to day of the<br>spoil of their enemies which they<br>found? for had there not been now<br>a much greater slaughter among<br>the Philistines?<br>31 And they smote the Philistines<br>that day from Michmash to Aijalon:<br>and the people were very faint.<br>32 And the people flew upon the<br>spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,<br>and calves, and slew them on the<br>ground: and the people did eat them<br>with the blood.<br>33 ¶ Then they told Saul, saying,<br>Behold, the people sin against the<br>LORD, in that they eat with the<br>blood.

And all the people<br>brought every man his ox with him<br>that night, and slew them there.<br>35 And Saul built an altar unto<br>the LORD: the same was the first<br>altar that he built unto the LORD.<br>36 ¶ And Saul said, Let us go<br>down after the Philistines by night,<br>and spoil them until the morning<br>light, and let us not leave a man of<br>them. And they said, Do whatsoever<br>seemeth good unto thee. Then said<br>the priest, Let us draw near hither<br>unto God.<br>37 And Saul asked counsel of God,<br>Shall I go down after the Philis-<br>tines? wilt thou deliver them into<br>the hand of Israel? But he a answered<br>him not that day.<br>38 And Saul said, Draw ye near<br>hither, all the chief of the people:<br>and know and see wherein this sin<br>hath been this day.<br>39 For, as the LORD liveth, which<br>saveth Israel, though it be in Jona-<br>than my son, he shall surely die.<br>But there was not a man among all<br>the people that answered him.<br>40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be<br>ye on one side, and I and Jonathan<br>my son will be on the other side.<br>And the people said unto Saul, Do<br>what seemeth good unto thee.<br>41 Therefore Saul said unto the<br>LORD God of Israel, a Give a perfect<br>lot. And Saul and Jonathan were<br>taken: but the people escaped.<br>42 And Saul said, Cast lots between<br>me and Jonathan my son. And<br>Jonathan was taken.<br>43 Then Saul said to Jonathan,<br>Tell me what thou hast done. And<br>Jonathan told him, and said, I did<br>but taste a little honey with the end|Col2|of the rod that was in mine hand,<br>and, lo, I must die.<br>44 And Saul answered, God do so<br>and more also: for thou shalt surely<br>die, Jonathan.<br>45 And the a people said unto<br>Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath<br>wrought this great salvation in<br>Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liv-<br>eth, there shall not one hair of his<br>head fall to the ground; for he hath<br>wrought with God this day. So the<br>people rescued Jonathan, that he<br>died not.<br>46 Then Saul went up from follow-<br>ing the Philistines: and the Philis-<br>tines went to their own place.<br>47 ¶ So Saul took the kingdom over<br>Israel, and fought against all his en-<br>emies on every side, against Moab,<br>and against the children of Am-<br>mon, and against Edom, and against<br>the kings of Zobah, and against the<br>Philistines: and whithersoever he<br>turned himself, he vexed them.<br>48 And he gathered an host, and<br>smote the Amalekites, and delivered<br>Israel out of the hands of them that<br>spoiled them.<br>49 Now the sons of a Saul were<br>Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-<br>shua: and the names of his two<br>daughters were these; the name of the<br>firstborn b Merab, and the name of<br>the younger c Michal:<br>50 And the name of Saul’s wife was<br>a Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz:<br>and the name of the captain of his<br>host was bA bner, the son of Ner,<br>Saul’s uncle.<br>51 And a Kish was the father of<br>Saul; and Ner the father of Abner<br>was the son of Abiel.<br>52 And there was a sore war against<br>the Philistines all the days of Saul:<br>and when Saul saw any strong man,<br>or any valiant man, he took him<br>unto him.|Col4|

Behold, to<br>c obey is better than d sacrifice, and<br>to hearken than the fat of e rams.<br>23 For a rebellion is as the sin of<br>witchcraft, and b stubbornness is<br>as iniquity and idolatry.

And the elders of the town<br>trembled at his coming, and said,<br>Comest thou peaceably ?<br>5 And he said, Peaceably: I am<br>come to sacrifice unto the LORD:<br>a sanctify yourselves, and come with<br>me to the sacrifice. And he sancti-<br>fied Jesse and his sons, and called<br>them to the sacrifice.<br>6 ¶ And it came to pass, when<br>they were come, that he looked on<br>a Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD’s<br>anointed is before him.<br>7 But the LORD said unto Samuel,<br>Look not on his countenance, or on<br>the height of his stature; because I<br>have refused him: for the LORD a seeth<br>not as b man seeth; for man looketh<br>on the outward c appearance, but the<br>d LORD looketh on the e heart.<br>8 Then Jesse called Abinadab,<br>and made him pass before Samuel.<br>And he said, Neither hath the LORD<br>chosen this.<br>9 Then Jesse made Shammah to<br>pass by. And he said, Neither hath<br>the LORD chosen this.<br>10 Again, Jesse made seven of his<br>sons to pass before Samuel. And<br>Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD<br>hath not chosen these.<br>11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are<br>here all thy children? And he said,<br>There remaineth yet the youngest,<br>and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.<br>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send<br>and fetch him: for we will not sit<br>down till he come hither.<br>12 And he sent, and brought him<br>in. Now he was ruddy, and withal|Col2|of a a beautiful countenance, and<br>goodly to look to. And the LORD<br>said, Arise, anoint him: for this<br>is he.<br>13 Then Samuel took the horn of<br>oil, and a anointed him in the midst<br>of his brethren: and the b Spirit of<br>the LORD came upon c David from<br>that day forward. So Samuel rose<br>up, and went to Ramah.<br>14 ¶ But the a Spirit of the LORD<br>b departed from Saul, and an evil<br>spirit c from the LORD troubled him.<br>15 And Saul’s servants said unto<br>him, Behold now, an evil spirit<br>a from God troubleth thee.<br>16 Let our lord now command thy<br>servants, which are before thee, to<br>seek out a man, who is a cunning<br>player on an harp: and it shall come<br>to pass, when the evil spirit a from<br>God is upon thee, that he shall<br>play with his hand, and thou shalt<br>be well.<br>17 And Saul said unto his servants,<br>Provide me now a man that can play<br>well, and bring him to me.<br>18 Then answered one of the ser-<br>vants, and said, Behold, I have seen<br>a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that<br>is cunning in playing, and a mighty<br>valiant man, and a man of war, and<br>a prudent in matters, and a comely<br>person, and the LORD is with him.<br>19 ¶ Wherefore Saul sent mes-<br>sengers unto Jesse, and said, Send<br>me David thy son, which is with<br>the sheep.<br>20 And Jesse took an ass laden with<br>bread, and a bottle of wine, and a<br>kid, and sent them by David his son<br>unto Saul.<br>21 And David came to Saul, and<br>stood before him: and he loved<br>him greatly; and he became his<br>armourbearer.|Col4|

|22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying,<br>Let David, I pray thee, stand be-<br>fore me; for he hath found favour<br>in my sight.<br>23 And it came to pass, when the<br>a evil spirit b from God was upon<br>Saul, that David took an harp, and<br>played with his hand: so Saul was<br>refreshed, and was well, and the<br>evil spirit departed from him.<br>CHAPTER 17<br>Israel and the Philistines engage in<br>war—Goliath of Gath, a giant, defies<br>Israel and challenges any Israelite to<br>personal combat—David goes against<br>him in the name of the Lord—David<br>slays Goliath with a sling and a stone—<br>Israel defeats the Philistines.<br>NOW the Philistines gathered to-<br>gether their armies to battle, and<br>were gathered together at Sho-<br>choh, which belongeth to Judah,<br>and pitched between Shochoh and<br>Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.<br>2 And Saul and the men of Is-<br>rael were gathered together, and<br>pitched by the valley of Elah, and<br>set the battle in array against the<br>Philistines.<br>3 And the Philistines stood on a<br>mountain on the one side, and Is-<br>rael stood on a mountain on the<br>other side: and there was a valley<br>between them.<br>4 ¶ And there went out a champion<br>out of the camp of the Philistines,<br>named Goliath, of a Gath, whose<br>height was six b cubits and a span.<br>5 And he had an helmet of brass<br>upon his head, and he was armed<br>with a coat of mail; and the weight<br>of the coat was five thousand shek-<br>els of brass.<br>6 And he had a greaves of brass upon<br>his legs, and b a target of brass be-<br>tween his shoulders.|Col2|7 And the a staff of his spear was<br>like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s<br>head weighed six hundred shekels<br>of iron: and one bearing a shield<br>went before him.<br>8 And he stood and cried unto the<br>armies of Israel, and said unto them,<br>Why are ye come out to set your bat-<br>tle in array ? am not I a Philistine,<br>and ye servants to Saul? choose you<br>a man for you, and let him come<br>down to me.<br>9 If he be able to fight with me,<br>and to kill me, then will we be your<br>servants: but if I prevail against<br>him, and kill him, then shall ye be<br>our servants, and serve us.<br>10 And the Philistine said, I defy<br>the armies of Israel this day; give me<br>a man, that we may fight together.<br>11 When Saul and all Israel heard<br>those words of the Philistine, they<br>were dismayed, and greatly afraid.<br>12 ¶ Now a David was the son of<br>that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-<br>judah, whose name was Jesse; and<br>he had eight sons: and the man went<br>among men for an old man in the<br>days of Saul.<br>13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse<br>went and followed Saul to the bat-<br>tle: and the names of his three sons<br>that went to the battle were a Eliab<br>the firstborn, and next unto him<br>Abinadab, and the third Shammah.<br>14 And David was the youngest:<br>and the three eldest followed Saul.<br>15 But David went and returned<br>from Saul to feed his father’s sheep<br>at Beth-lehem.<br>16 And the Philistine drew near<br>morning and evening, and presented<br>himself forty days.<br>17 And Jesse said unto David his<br>son, Take now for thy brethren an<br>ephah of this parched corn, and these<br>ten loaves, and run to the camp to<br>thy brethren;|Col4|

I know thy<br>pride, and the naughtiness of thine<br>heart; for thou art come down that<br>thou mightest see the battle.<br>29 And David said, What have I<br>now done? Is there not a cause?<br>30 ¶ And he turned from him to-<br>ward another, and spake after the<br>same manner: and the people an-<br>swered him again after the former<br>manner.<br>31 And when the words were<br>heard which David spake, they re-<br>hearsed them before Saul: and he<br>sent for him.<br>32 ¶ And David said to Saul, Let<br>no man’s heart fail because of him;<br>thy servant a will go and b fight with<br>this Philistine.<br>33 And Saul said to David, Thou<br>art not able to go against this Phi-<br>listine to fight with him: for thou<br>art but a a youth, and he a man of<br>war from his youth.<br>34 And David said unto Saul, Thy<br>servant kept his father’s sheep, and<br>there came a lion, and a bear, and<br>took a lamb out of the flock:<br>35 And I went out after him, and<br>smote him, and delivered it out<br>of his mouth: and when he arose<br>against me, I caught him by his<br>beard, and smote him, and slew him.<br>36 Thy servant slew both the lion<br>and the bear: and this uncircum-<br>cised Philistine shall be as one of<br>them, seeing he hath defied the<br>armies of the living God.<br>37 David said moreover, The LORD<br>that a delivered me out of the paw<br>of the lion, and out of the paw of<br>the bear, he will b deliver me out<br>of the hand of this Philistine.

And the Philistine<br>cursed David by his gods.<br>44 And the Philistine said to Da-<br>vid, Come to me, and I will give thy<br>flesh unto the fowls of the air, and<br>to the beasts of the field.<br>45 Then said David to the Phi-<br>listine, Thou comest to me with a<br>sword, and with a spear, and with<br>a shield: but I come to thee in the<br>a name of the LORD of hosts, the God<br>of the armies of Israel, whom thou<br>hast defied.<br>46 This day will the LORD a deliver<br>thee into mine hand; and I will<br>smite thee, and take thine head<br>from thee; and I will give the car-<br>cases of the host of the Philistines<br>this day unto the fowls of the air,<br>and to the wild beasts of the earth;<br>that all the earth may b know that<br>there is a God in Israel.<br>47 And all this assembly shall<br>know that the LORD saveth not with<br>sword and spear: for the a battle is<br>the LORD’s, and he will give you<br>into our hands.|Col2|48 And it came to pass, when the<br>Philistine arose, and came and drew<br>nigh to meet David, that David<br>hasted, and ran toward the army<br>to meet the Philistine.<br>49 And David put his hand in his<br>bag, and took thence a stone, and<br>slang it, and smote the Philistine<br>in his forehead, that the stone sunk<br>into his forehead; and he fell upon<br>his face to the earth.<br>50 So David prevailed over the<br>Philistine with a sling and with a<br>stone, and smote the Philistine, and<br>slew him; but there was no sword in<br>the hand of David.<br>51 Therefore David ran, and stood<br>upon the Philistine, and took his<br>sword, and drew it out of the sheath<br>thereof, and slew him, and cut off<br>his head therewith. And when the<br>Philistines saw their champion was<br>dead, they fled.<br>52 And the men of Israel and<br>of Judah arose, and shouted, and<br>pursued the Philistines, until thou<br>come to the valley, and to the gates<br>of Ekron. And the wounded of the<br>Philistines fell down by the way to<br>Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto<br>Ekron.<br>53 And the children of Israel<br>returned from chasing after the<br>Philistines, and they spoiled their<br>tents.<br>54 And David took the head of the<br>Philistine, and brought it to Jeru-<br>salem; but he put his armour in his<br>tent.<br>55 ¶ And when Saul saw David go<br>forth against the Philistine, he said<br>unto Abner, the captain of the host,<br>a Abner, whose son is this youth?<br>And Abner said, As thy soul liveth,<br>O king, I cannot tell.<br>56 And the king said, Inquire thou<br>whose son the a stripling is.<br>57 And as David returned from the<br>slaughter of the Philistine, Abner<br>took him, and brought him before<br>Saul with the head of the Philistine<br>in his hand.|Col4|

And David avoided<br>out of his presence twice.<br>12 ¶ And Saul was afraid of David,<br>because the LORD was with him,<br>and was a departed from Saul.<br>13 Therefore Saul removed him<br>from him, and made him his cap-<br>tain over a thousand; and he went<br>out and came in before the people.<br>14 And David behaved himself<br>wisely in all his ways; and the LORD<br>was with him.<br>15 Wherefore when Saul saw that<br>he behaved himself very wisely, he<br>was afraid of him.<br>16 But all Israel and aJ udah loved<br>David, because he went out and<br>came in before them.<br>17 ¶ And Saul said to David, Be-<br>hold my elder daughter a Merab, her<br>will I give thee to wife: only be thou<br>valiant for me, and fight the LORD’s<br>battles. For Saul said, Let not mine<br>hand be upon him, but let the hand<br>of the Philistines be upon him.<br>18 And David said unto Saul,<br>Who am I? and what is my life, or<br>my father’s family in Israel, that I<br>should be son in law to the king?<br>19 But it came to pass at the time<br>when Merab Saul’s daughter should<br>have been given to David, that she<br>was given unto Adriel the Meho-<br>lathite to wife.<br>20 And Michal Saul’s daughter<br>loved David: and they told Saul,<br>and the thing pleased him.|Col4|

Wherefore Saul<br>said to David, Thou shalt this day be<br>my son in law a in the one of the twain.<br>22 ¶ And Saul commanded his ser-<br>vants, saying, Commune with David<br>secretly, and say, Behold, the king<br>hath delight in thee, and all his<br>servants love thee: now therefore<br>be the king’s son in law.<br>23 And Saul’s servants spake those<br>words in the ears of David. And Da-<br>vid said, Seemeth it to you a a light<br>thing to be a king’s son in law, seeing<br>that I am a poor man, and lightly<br>esteemed?<br>24 And the servants of Saul told<br>him, saying, On this manner spake<br>David.<br>25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say<br>to David, The king desireth not any<br>dowry, but an hundred foreskins of<br>the Philistines, to be avenged of the<br>king’s enemies. But Saul thought to<br>make David fall by the hand of the<br>Philistines.<br>26 And when his servants told Da-<br>vid these words, it pleased David<br>well to be the king’s son in law: and<br>the days were not expired.<br>27 Wherefore David arose and<br>went, he and his men, and slew of<br>the Philistines two hundred men;<br>and David brought their foreskins,<br>and they gave them in a full tale to<br>the king, that he might be the king’s<br>son in law. And Saul gave him b Mi-<br>chal his daughter to wife.<br>28 ¶ And Saul saw and knew that<br>the LORD was with David, and that<br>Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.<br>29 And Saul was yet the more<br>afraid of David; and Saul became<br>David’s enemy continually.<br>30 Then the princes of the Philis-<br>tines went forth: and it came to pass,<br>after they went forth, that David<br>behaved himself more wisely than<br>all the servants of Saul; so that his<br>name was much a set by.|Col2|CHAPTER 19<br>Saul seeks to kill David—Michal saves<br>David by artifice—David joins Samuel<br>and the company of prophets.<br>AND Saul spake to Jonathan his son,<br>and to all his servants, that they<br>should kill David.<br>2 But Jonathan Saul’s son delighted<br>much in David: and Jonathan told<br>David, saying, Saul my father<br>seek eth to kill thee: now therefore,<br>I pray thee, take heed to thyself<br>until the morning, and abide in a<br>secret place, and hide thyself:<br>3 And I will go out and stand be-<br>side my father in the field where<br>thou art, and I will commune with<br>my father of thee; and what I see,<br>that I will tell thee.<br>4 ¶ And Jonathan spake good of<br>David unto Saul his father, and<br>said unto him, Let not the king sin<br>against his servant, against David;<br>because he hath not sinned against<br>thee, and because his works have<br>been to thee-ward very good:<br>5 For he did put his life in his<br>hand, and slew the Philistine, and<br>the LORD wrought a great salvation<br>for all Israel: thou sawest it, and<br>didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt<br>thou sin against innocent blood, to<br>slay David without a cause?<br>6 And Saul hearkened unto the<br>voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As<br>the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.<br>7 And Jonathan called David, and<br>Jonathan shewed him all those<br>things.

And Michal answered Saul,<br>He said unto me, Let me go; why<br>should I kill thee?<br>18 ¶ So David fled, and escaped,<br>and came to Samuel to Ramah, and<br>told him all that Saul had done to<br>him. And he and Samuel went and<br>dwelt in Naioth.<br>19 And it was told Saul, saying, Be-<br>hold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.<br>20 And Saul sent messengers to<br>take David: and when they saw the<br>company of the a prophets prophe-<br>sying, and Samuel standing as ap-<br>pointed over them, the Spirit of God<br>was upon the messengers of Saul,<br>and they also prophesied.<br>21 And when it was told Saul, he<br>sent other messengers, and they<br>prophesied likewise. And Saul sent<br>messengers again the third time,<br>and they prophesied also.|Col2|22 Then went he also to Ramah,<br>and came to a great well that is<br>in Sechu: and he asked and said,<br>Where are Samuel and David? And<br>one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in<br>Ramah.<br>23 And he went thither to Naioth<br>in Ramah: and the Spirit of God<br>was upon him also, and he went<br>on, and prophesied, until he came<br>to Naioth in Ramah.<br>24 And he stripped off his clothes<br>also, and prophesied before Samuel<br>in like manner, and lay down na-<br>ked all that day and all that night.<br>Wherefore they say, Is Saul also<br>among the a prophets?<br>CHAPTER 20<br>David and Jonathan make a covenant<br>of friendship and peace—They take<br>leave of each other.<br>AND David fled from Naioth in<br>Ramah, and came and said before<br>Jonathan, What have I done? what<br>is mine iniquity ? and what is my sin<br>before thy father, that he seeketh<br>my life?<br>2 And he said unto him, God for-<br>bid; thou shalt not die: behold, my<br>father will do nothing either great<br>or small, but that he will shew it<br>me: and why should my father hide<br>this thing from me? it is not so.<br>3 And David sware moreover, and<br>said, Thy father certainly knoweth<br>that I have found grace in thine<br>eyes; and he saith, Let not Jona-<br>than know this, lest he be grieved:<br>but truly as the LORD liveth, and<br>as thy soul liveth, there is but a step<br>between me and death.<br>4 Then said Jonathan unto David,<br>Whatsoever thy soul a desireth, I will<br>even do it for thee.<br>5 And David said unto Jonathan,<br>Behold, to morrow is the new a moon,<br>and I should not fail to sit with the<br>king at meat: but let me go, that I<br>may hide myself in the field unto<br>the third day at even.<br>6 If thy father at all miss me, then|Col4|

|say, David earnestly asked leave<br>of me that he might run to Beth-<br>lehem his city: for there is a yearly<br>sacrifice there for all the family.<br>7 If he say thus, It is well; thy ser-<br>vant shall have peace: but if he be<br>very wroth, then be sure that evil<br>is determined by him.<br>8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly<br>with thy servant; for thou hast<br>brought thy servant into a a covenant<br>of the LORD with thee: notwithstand-<br>ing, if there be in me iniquity, slay<br>me thyself; for why shouldest thou<br>bring me to thy father?<br>9 And Jonathan said, Far be it from<br>thee: for if I knew certainly that evil<br>were determined by my father to<br>come upon thee, then would not I<br>tell it thee?<br>10 Then said David to Jonathan,<br>Who shall tell me? or what if thy<br>father answer thee roughly?<br>11 ¶ And Jonathan said unto Da-<br>vid, Come, and let us go out into<br>the field. And they went out both<br>of them into the field.<br>12 And Jonathan said unto David,<br>O LORD God of Israel, when I have<br>sounded my father about to mor-<br>row any time, or the third day, and,<br>behold, if there be good toward Da-<br>vid, and I then send not unto thee,<br>and shew it thee;<br>13 The LORD do so and much more<br>to Jonathan: but if it please my<br>father to do thee evil, then I will<br>shew it thee, and send thee away,<br>that thou mayest go in peace: and<br>the LORD be with thee, as he hath<br>been with my father.<br>14 And thou shalt not only while<br>yet I live shew me the a kindness of<br>the LORD, that I die not:<br>15 But also thou shalt not cut off<br>thy kindness from my house for<br>ever: no, not when the LORD hath<br>cut off the enemies of David every<br>one from the face of the earth.<br>16 So Jonathan made a covenant<br>with the house of David, saying,<br>Let the LORD even require it at the<br>hand of David’s enemies.|Col2|17 And Jonathan caused David to<br>swear again, because he loved him:<br>for he loved him as he loved his<br>own soul.<br>18 Then Jonathan said to David,<br>To morrow is the new moon: and<br>thou shalt be missed, because thy<br>seat will be empty.<br>19 And when thou hast stayed<br>three days, then thou shalt go down<br>quickly, and come to the place<br>where thou didst hide thyself when<br>the business was in hand, and shalt<br>remain by the stone Ezel.<br>20 And I will shoot three arrows<br>on the side thereof, as though I shot<br>at a mark.<br>21 And, behold, I will send a lad,<br>saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I<br>expressly say unto the lad, Behold,<br>the arrows are on this side of thee,<br>take them; then come thou: for there<br>is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the<br>LORD liveth.<br>22 But if I say thus unto the young<br>man, Behold, the arrows are beyond<br>thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath<br>sent thee away.<br>23 And as touching the matter<br>which thou and I have spoken of,<br>behold, the LORD be between thee<br>and me for ever.<br>24 ¶ So David hid himself in the<br>field: and when the new moon was<br>come, the king sat him down to<br>eat meat.<br>25 And the king sat upon his seat,<br>as at other times, even upon a seat<br>by the wall: and Jonathan arose,<br>and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and<br>David’s place was empty.<br>26 Nevertheless Saul spake not<br>any thing that day: for he thought,<br>Something hath befallen him, he<br>is not clean; surely he is not clean.<br>27 And it came to pass on the mor-<br>row, which was the second day of<br>the month, that David’s place was<br>empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan<br>his son, Wherefore cometh not the<br>son of Jesse to meat, neither yes-<br>terday, nor to day?<br>28 And Jonathan answered Saul,|

1 SAMUEL 20:29–21:5 412








|David earnestly asked leave of me<br>to go to Beth-lehem:<br>29 And he said, Let me go, I pray<br>thee; for our family hath a sacri-<br>fice in the city; and my brother, he<br>hath commanded me to be there: and<br>now, if I have found favour in thine<br>eyes, let me get away, I pray thee,<br>and see my brethren. Therefore he<br>cometh not unto the king’s table.<br>30 Then Saul’s a anger was kindled<br>against Jonathan, and he said unto<br>him, Thou son of the perverse re-<br>bellious woman, do not I know that<br>thou hast chosen the son of Jesse<br>to thine own confusion, and unto<br>the confusion of thy mother’s na-<br>kedness?<br>31 For as long as the son of Jesse<br>liveth upon the ground, thou shalt<br>not be a established, nor thy king-<br>dom. Wherefore now send and fetch<br>him unto me, for he shall surely die.<br>32 And Jonathan answered Saul his<br>father, and said unto him, Where-<br>fore shall he be slain? what hath<br>he done?<br>33 And Saul cast a javelin at him<br>to smite him: whereby Jonathan<br>knew that it was determined of his<br>father to slay David.<br>34 So Jonathan arose from the table<br>in fierce anger, and did eat no meat<br>the second day of the month: for he<br>was grieved for David, because his<br>father had done him shame.<br>35 ¶ And it came to pass in the<br>morning, that Jonathan went out<br>into the field at the time appointed<br>with David, and a little lad with him.<br>36 And he said unto his lad, Run,<br>find out now the arrows which I<br>shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot<br>an arrow beyond him.<br>37 And when the lad was come to<br>the place of the arrow which Jona-<br>than had shot, Jonathan cried after<br>the lad, and said, Is not the arrow<br>beyond thee?<br>38 And Jonathan cried after the<br>lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.<br>And Jonathan’s lad gathered up<br>the arrows, and came to his master.|Col2|39 But the lad knew not any thing:<br>only Jonathan and David knew the<br>matter.<br>40 And Jonathan gave his artillery<br>unto his lad, and said unto him, Go,<br>carry them to the city.<br>41 ¶ And as soon as the lad was<br>gone, David arose out of a place to-<br>ward the south, and fell on his face<br>to the ground, and bowed himself<br>three times: and they kissed one an-<br>other, and wept one with another,<br>until David exceeded.<br>42 And a Jonathan said to David,<br>Go in peace, forasmuch as we have<br>sworn both of us in the name of the<br>LORD, saying, The LORD be between<br>me and thee, and between my seed<br>and thy seed for ever. And he arose<br>and departed: and Jonathan went<br>into the city.<br>CHAPTER 21<br>David gets help from Ahimelech the<br>priest—He eats the shewbread—He goes<br>to Gath, where he pretends madness.<br>THEN came David to a Nob to Ahim-<br>elech the priest: and Ahimelech was<br>afraid at the meeting of David, and<br>said unto him, Why art thou alone,<br>and no man with thee?<br>2 And David said unto Ahime-<br>lech the priest, The king hath com-<br>manded me a business, and hath<br>said unto me, Let no man know any<br>thing of the business whereabout<br>I send thee, and what I have com-<br>manded thee: and I have appointed<br>my servants to such and such a<br>place.<br>3 Now therefore what is under<br>thine hand? give me five loaves of<br>bread in mine hand, or what there<br>is present.<br>4 And the priest answered Da-<br>vid, and said, There is no common<br>bread under mine hand, but there<br>is a hallowed b bread; if the young<br>men have kept themselves at least<br>from women.<br>5 And David answered the priest,<br>and said unto him, Of a truth women|Col4|

And David said, There is<br>none like that; give it me.<br>10 ¶ And David arose, and fled<br>that day for fear of Saul, and went<br>to Achish the king of Gath.<br>11 And the servants of Achish said<br>unto him, Is not this David the king<br>of the land? did they not a sing one<br>to another of him in dances, saying,<br>Saul hath slain his thousands, and<br>David his ten thousands?<br>12 And David laid up these words<br>in his heart, and was sore afraid of<br>Achish the king of Gath.<br>13 And he changed his behaviour<br>before them, and feigned himself<br>mad in their hands, and scrab-<br>bled on the doors of the gate, and<br>let his a spittle fall down upon his<br>beard.<br>14 Then said Achish unto his ser-<br>vants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:|Col2|wherefore then have ye brought<br>him to me?<br>15 Have I need of mad men, that<br>ye have brought this fellow to play<br>the mad man in my presence? shall<br>this fellow come into my house?<br>CHAPTER 22<br>David gains followers—He goes from<br>one place to another, fleeing from Saul—<br>Saul slays the priests who showed kind-<br>ness to David.<br>DAVID therefore departed thence,<br>and escaped to the cave Adullam:<br>and when his brethren and all his<br>father’s house heard it, they went<br>down thither to him.<br>2 And every one that was in dis-<br>tress, and every one that was in debt,<br>and every one that was discontented,<br>gathered themselves unto him; and<br>he became a captain over them: and<br>there were with him about four<br>hundred men.<br>3 ¶ And David went thence to<br>Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto<br>the king of Moab, Let my father<br>and my mother, I pray thee, come<br>forth, and be with you, till I know<br>what God will do for me.<br>4 And he brought them before the<br>king of Moab: and they dwelt with<br>him all the while that David was<br>in the hold.<br>5 ¶ And the prophet a Gad said<br>unto David, Abide not in the hold;<br>depart, and get thee into the land<br>of Judah. Then David departed,<br>and came into the forest of Hareth.<br>6 ¶ When Saul heard that David<br>was discovered, and the men that<br>were with him, (now Saul a abode<br>in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah,<br>having his spear in his hand, and<br>all his servants were standing about<br>him;)<br>7 Then Saul said unto his servants<br>that stood about him, Hear now, ye<br>Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give<br>every one of you fields and vine-<br>yards, and make you all captains|Col4|

|of thousands, and captains of<br>hundreds;<br>8 That all of you have a conspired<br>against me, and there is none that<br>sheweth me that my son hath made<br>a b league with the son of Jesse, and<br>there is none of you that is sorry for<br>me, or sheweth unto me that my son<br>hath stirred up my servant against<br>me, to lie in wait, as at this day ?<br>9 ¶ Then answered a Doeg the<br>Edomite, which was set over the<br>servants of Saul, and said, I saw<br>the son of Jesse coming to b Nob, to<br>Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.<br>10 And he inquired of the LORD<br>for him, and gave him a victuals,<br>and gave him the sword of Goliath<br>the Philistine.<br>11 Then the king sent to call<br>Ahimelech the priest, the son of<br>Ahitub, and all his father’s house,<br>the priests that were in Nob: and<br>they came all of them to the king.<br>12 And Saul said, Hear now, thou<br>son of Ahitub. And he answered,<br>Here I am, my lord.<br>13 And Saul said unto him, Why<br>have ye conspired against me, thou<br>and the son of Jesse, in that thou<br>hast given him bread, and a sword,<br>and hast inquired of God for him,<br>that he should rise against me, to<br>lie in wait, as at this day ?<br>14 Then Ahimelech answered the<br>king, and said, And who is so faith-<br>ful among all thy servants as David,<br>which is the king’s son in law, and<br>goeth at thy bidding, and is hon-<br>ourable in thine house?<br>15 Did I then begin to inquire of<br>God for him? be it far from me: let<br>not the king impute any thing unto<br>his servant, nor to all the house of<br>my father: for thy servant knew<br>nothing of all this, less or more.<br>16 And the king said, Thou shalt<br>surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and<br>all thy father’s house.<br>17 ¶ And the king said unto the|Col2|footmen that stood about him, Turn,<br>and slay the priests of the LORD;<br>because their hand also is with<br>David, and because they knew when<br>he fled, and did not shew it to me.<br>But the servants of the king would<br>not put forth their hand to fall upon<br>the priests of the LORD.<br>18 And the king said to Doeg, Turn<br>thou, and fall upon the priests. And<br>Doeg the Edomite turned, and he<br>fell upon the priests, and slew on<br>that day fourscore and five persons<br>that did wear a linen a ephod.<br>19 And Nob, the city of the priests,<br>smote he with the edge of the<br>sword, both men and women, chil-<br>dren and sucklings, and oxen, and<br>asses, and sheep, with the edge of the<br>sword.<br>20 ¶ And one of the sons of Ahime-<br>lech the son of Ahitub, named<br>aA biathar, escaped, and fled after<br>David.<br>21 And Abiathar shewed David<br>that Saul had slain the LORD’s<br>priests.<br>22 And David said unto Abiathar,<br>I knew it that day, when Doeg the<br>Edomite was there, that he would<br>surely tell Saul: I have occasioned<br>the death of all the persons of thy<br>father’s house.<br>23 Abide thou with me, fear not:<br>for he that seeketh my life seeketh<br>thy life: but with me thou shalt be<br>in safeguard.<br>CHAPTER 23<br>David smites the Philistines and saves<br>Keilah—He continues to flee from<br>Saul—Jonathan comforts him in Ziph.<br>THEN they told David, saying, Be-<br>hold, the Philistines fight against<br>a Keilah, and they rob the thresh-<br>ingfloors.<br>2 Therefore David a inquired of the<br>LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite<br>these Philistines?

And the LORD answered<br>him and said, Arise, go down to<br>Keilah; for I will deliver the Phi-<br>listines into thine hand.<br>5 So David and his men went to<br>Keilah, and fought with the Philis-<br>tines, and brought away their cat-<br>tle, and a smote them with a great<br>slaughter. So David saved the in-<br>habitants of Keilah.<br>6 And it came to pass, when Abia-<br>thar the son of Ahimelech fled to<br>David to Keilah, that he came down<br>with an ephod in his hand.<br>7 ¶ And it was told Saul that<br>David was come to Keilah. And Saul<br>said, God hath delivered him into<br>mine hand; for he is shut in, by en-<br>tering into a town that hath gates<br>and bars.<br>8 And Saul called all the people to-<br>gether to war, to go down to Keilah,<br>to besiege David and his men.<br>9 ¶ And David knew that Saul se-<br>cretly practised mischief against<br>him; and he said to Abiathar the<br>priest, Bring hither the ephod.<br>10 Then said David, O LORD God<br>of Israel, thy servant hath certainly<br>heard that Saul seeketh to come<br>to Keilah, to destroy the city for<br>my sake.<br>11 Will the men of Keilah deliver<br>me up into his hand? will Saul come<br>down, as thy servant hath heard? O<br>LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee,<br>tell thy servant. And the LORD said,<br>He will come down.<br>12 Then said David, Will the men<br>of Keilah deliver me and my men<br>into the hand of Saul? And the LORD<br>said, They will deliver thee up.<br>13 ¶ Then David and his a men,<br>which were about six hundred, arose|Col2|and departed out of Keilah, and<br>went whithersoever they could go.<br>And it was told Saul that David<br>was escaped from Keilah; and he<br>forbare to go forth.<br>14 And David abode in the wilder-<br>ness in strong holds, and remained<br>in a mountain in the wilderness of<br>Ziph. And Saul sought him every<br>day, but God delivered him not<br>into his hand.<br>15 And David saw that Saul was<br>come out to seek his life: and Da-<br>vid was in the wilderness of Ziph<br>in a a wood.<br>16 ¶ And a Jonathan Saul’s son<br>arose, and went to David into the<br>wood, and strengthened his hand<br>in God.<br>17 And he said unto him, Fear<br>not: for the hand of Saul my father<br>shall not find thee; and thou shalt<br>be king over Israel, and I shall be<br>next unto thee; and that also Saul<br>my father a knoweth.<br>18 And they two made a covenant<br>before the LORD: and David abode<br>in the wood, and Jonathan went to<br>his house.<br>19 ¶ Then came up the Ziphites<br>to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth<br>not David hide himself with us in<br>strong holds in the wood, in the hill<br>of Hachilah, which is on the south<br>of Jeshimon?<br>20 Now therefore, O king, come<br>down according to all the desire<br>of thy soul to come down; and our<br>part shall be to deliver him into the<br>king’s hand.<br>21 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of<br>the LORD; for ye have compassion<br>on me.<br>22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet,<br>and know and see his place where<br>a his haunt is, and who hath seen<br>him there: for it is told me that he<br>dealeth very subtilly.<br>23 See therefore, and take knowl-<br>edge of all the lurking places where<br>he hideth himself, and come ye<br>again to me with the certainty, and I|Col4|

|AND the Ziphites came unto Saul<br>to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David<br>hide himself in the hill of Hachilah,<br>which is before Jeshimon?<br>2 Then Saul arose, and went down<br>to the wilderness of Ziph, having<br>three thousand chosen men of Is-<br>rael with him, to seek David in the<br>wilderness of Ziph.<br>3 And Saul pitched in the hill<br>of Hachilah, which is before Je-<br>shimon, by the way. But David<br>abode in the wilderness, and he saw<br>that Saul came after him into the<br>wilderness.<br>4 David therefore sent out spies,<br>and understood that Saul was come<br>in very deed.<br>5 ¶ And David arose, and came to<br>the place where Saul had pitched:<br>and David beheld the place where<br>Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,<br>the captain of his host: and Saul<br>lay in the a trench, and the people<br>pitched round about him.<br>6 Then answered David and said<br>to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to<br>Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother<br>to Joab, saying, Who will go down<br>with me to Saul to the camp? And<br>aA bishai said, I will go down with<br>thee.<br>7 So David and Abishai came to<br>the people by night: and, behold,<br>Saul lay sleeping within the trench,<br>and his spear stuck in the ground<br>at a his bolster: but Abner and the<br>people lay round about him.<br>8 Then said Abishai to David, God<br>hath delivered thine enemy into<br>thine hand this day: now there-<br>fore let me smite him, I pray thee,<br>with the spear even to the earth at<br>once, and I will not smite him the<br>second time.<br>9 And David said to Abishai, De-<br>stroy him not: for a who can stretch<br>forth his hand against the LORD’s<br>anointed, and be guiltless?<br>10 David said furthermore, As the<br>LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite<br>him; or his day shall come to a die;|Col2|or he shall descend into battle, and<br>perish.<br>11 The LORD forbid that I should<br>stretch forth mine hand against the<br>LORD’s anointed: but, I pray thee,<br>take thou now the spear that is at<br>his bolster, and the cruse of water,<br>and let us go.<br>12 So David took the spear and<br>the cruse of water from Saul’s bol-<br>ster; and they gat them away, and<br>no man saw it, nor knew it, neither<br>awaked: for they were all asleep; be-<br>cause a a deep sleep from the LORD<br>was fallen upon them.<br>13 ¶ Then David went over to the<br>other side, and stood on the top of<br>an hill afar off; a great space being<br>between them:<br>14 And David cried to the people,<br>and to Abner the son of Ner, saying,<br>Answerest thou not, Abner?

And Saul had a put away those<br>that had b familiar spirits, and the<br>wizards, out of the land.<br>4 And the Philistines gathered<br>themselves together, and came and<br>pitched in Shunem: and Saul gath-<br>ered all Israel together, and they<br>pitched in Gilboa.<br>5 And when Saul saw the host of<br>the Philistines, he was afraid, and<br>his heart greatly trembled.<br>6 And when Saul inquired of the<br>LORD, the LORD a answered him not,<br>neither by b dreams, nor by c Urim,<br>nor by prophets.<br>7 ¶ Then said Saul unto his ser-<br>vants, Seek me a woman that hath<br>a a familiar spirit, that I may go to<br>her, and inquire of her. And his ser-<br>vants said to him, Behold, there is a<br>woman that hath a familiar spirit<br>at En-dor.<br>8 And Saul disguised himself, and<br>put on other raiment, and he went,<br>and two men with him, and they<br>came to the woman by night: and|Col2|he said, I pray thee, divine unto me<br>by the familiar spirit, and bring me<br>him up, whom I shall name unto<br>thee.<br>9 And the woman said unto him,<br>Behold, thou knowest what Saul<br>hath done, how he hath cut off those<br>that have familiar spirits, and the<br>wizards, out of the land: wherefore<br>then layest thou a snare for my life,<br>to cause me to die?<br>10 And Saul sware to her by the<br>LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,<br>there shall no punishment happen<br>to thee for this thing.<br>11 Then said the woman, Whom<br>shall I bring up unto thee? And he<br>said, Bring me up Samuel.<br>12 And when the woman saw Sam-<br>uel, she cried with a loud voice: and<br>the woman spake to Saul, saying,<br>Why hast thou deceived me? for<br>thou art Saul.<br>13 And the king said unto her, Be<br>not afraid: for what sawest thou?<br>And the woman said unto Saul,<br>I saw gods ascending out of the<br>earth.<br>14 And he said unto her, What<br>form is he of? And she said, aA n old<br>man cometh up; and he is covered<br>with a mantle. And Saul perceived<br>that it was Samuel, and he stooped<br>with his face to the ground, and<br>bowed himself.<br>15 ¶ And Samuel said to Saul,<br>Why hast thou disquieted me, to<br>bring me up? And Saul answered,<br>I am sore distressed; for the Phi-<br>listines make war against me, and<br>God is a departed from me, and an-<br>swereth me no more, neither by<br>prophets, nor by dreams: therefore<br>I have called thee, that thou may-<br>est make known unto me what I<br>shall do.<br>16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore|Col4|

|then dost thou ask of me, seeing the<br>LORD is departed from thee, and is<br>become thine enemy ?<br>17 And the LORD hath done to<br>him, as he spake by me: for the<br>LORD hath rent the a kingdom out<br>of thine hand, and given it to thy<br>neighbour, even to David:<br>18 Because thou a obeyedst not<br>the voice of the LORD, nor execut-<br>edst his fierce wrath upon Amalek,<br>therefore hath the LORD done this<br>thing unto thee this day.<br>19 Moreover the LORD will also<br>deliver Israel with thee into the<br>hand of the Philistines: and to mor-<br>row shalt thou and thy sons be with<br>me: the LORD also shall deliver the<br>host of Israel into the hand of the<br>Philistines.<br>20 Then a Saul fell straightway all<br>along on the earth, and was sore<br>afraid, because of the words of Sa-<br>muel: and there was no strength in<br>him; for he had eaten no bread all<br>the day, nor all the night.<br>21 ¶ And the woman came unto<br>Saul, and saw that he was sore<br>troubled, and said unto him, Be-<br>hold, thine handmaid hath obeyed<br>thy voice, and I have put my life<br>in my hand, and have hearkened<br>unto thy words which thou spakest<br>unto me.<br>22 Now therefore, I pray thee,<br>hearken thou also unto the voice<br>of thine handmaid, and let me set<br>a morsel of bread before thee; and<br>eat, that thou mayest have strength,<br>when thou goest on thy way.<br>23 But he refused, and said, I will<br>not eat. But his servants, together<br>with the woman, compelled him;<br>and he hearkened unto their voice.<br>So he arose from the earth, and sat<br>upon the bed.<br>24 And the woman had a fat calf in<br>the house; and she hasted, and killed<br>it, and took flour, and kneaded it,<br>and did bake a unleavened bread<br>thereof:<br>25 And she brought it before Saul,|Col2|and before his servants; and they<br>did eat.

|peace, that thou displease not the<br>lords of the Philistines.<br>8 ¶ And David said unto Achish,<br>But what have I done? and what<br>hast thou found in thy servant so<br>long as I have been with thee unto<br>this day, that I may not go fight<br>against the enemies of my lord the<br>king?<br>9 And Achish answered and said<br>to David, I know that thou art good<br>in my sight, as an a angel of God:<br>notwithstanding the princes of the<br>Philistines have said, He shall not<br>go up with us to the battle.<br>10 Wherefore now rise up early<br>in the morning with thy master’s<br>servants that are come with thee:<br>and as soon as ye be up early in the<br>morning, and have light, depart.<br>11 So David and his men rose up<br>early to depart in the morning, to<br>return into the land of the Philis-<br>tines. And the Philistines went up<br>to Jezreel.<br>CHAPTER 30<br>The Amalekites spoil Ziklag and the<br>borders of Judah—David smites Ama-<br>lek and regains and divides the spoil.<br>AND it came to pass, when David<br>and his men were come to Ziklag on<br>the third day, that the Amalekites<br>had invaded the south, and Ziklag,<br>and smitten Ziklag, and burned it<br>with fire;<br>2 And had taken the women cap-<br>tives, that were therein: they slew<br>not any, either great or small, but<br>carried them away, and went on<br>their way.<br>3 ¶ So David and his men came to<br>the city, and, behold, it was burned<br>with fire; and their wives, and their<br>sons, and their daughters, were<br>taken captives.<br>4 Then David and the people that<br>were with him lifted up their voice<br>and wept, until they had no more<br>power to weep.<br>5 And David’s two a wives were<br>taken captives, Ahinoam the Jez-|Col2|reelitess, and Abigail the wife of<br>Nabal the Carmelite.<br>6 And David was greatly distressed;<br>for the people spake of stoning<br>him, because the soul of all the<br>people was grieved, every man for<br>his sons and for his daughters: but<br>David a encouraged himself in the<br>LORD his God.<br>7 And David said to Abiathar<br>the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray<br>thee, bring me hither the ephod.<br>And Abiathar brought thither the<br>ephod to David.<br>8 And David inquired at the LORD,<br>saying, Shall I pursue after this<br>troop? shall I overtake them? And<br>he answered him, Pursue: for thou<br>shalt surely overtake them, and with-<br>out fail recover all.<br>9 So David went, he and the six<br>hundred men that were with him,<br>and came to the brook Besor, where<br>those that were left behind stayed.<br>10 But David pursued, he and<br>four hundred men: for two hun-<br>dred abode behind, which were so<br>faint that they could not go over<br>the brook Besor.<br>11 ¶ And they found an Egyptian<br>in the field, and brought him to<br>David, and gave him bread, and he<br>did eat; and they made him drink<br>water;<br>12 And they gave him a piece of<br>a cake of figs, and two clusters of<br>raisins: and when he had eaten,<br>his spirit came again to him: for he<br>had eaten no bread, nor drunk any<br>water, three days and three nights.<br>13 And David said unto him, To<br>whom belongest thou? and whence<br>art thou? And he said, I am a young<br>man of Egypt, servant to an Amalek-<br>ite; and my master left me, because<br>three days agone I fell sick.<br>14 We made an invasion upon the<br>south of the a Cherethites, and upon<br>the coast which belongeth to Judah,<br>and upon the south of Caleb; and<br>we burned Ziklag with fire.<br>15 And David said to him, Canst thou<br>bring me down to this company ?|Col4|

|And he said, Swear unto me by God,<br>that thou wilt neither kill me, nor<br>deliver me into the hands of my<br>a master, and I will bring thee down<br>to this company.<br>16 ¶ And when he had brought<br>him down, behold, they were spread<br>abroad upon all the earth, eating<br>and drinking, and dancing, because<br>of all the great spoil that they had<br>taken out of the land of the Phi-<br>listines, and out of the land of<br>Judah.<br>17 And David smote them from<br>the twilight even unto the evening<br>of the next day: and there escaped<br>not a man of them, save four hun-<br>dred young men, which rode upon<br>camels, and fled.<br>18 And David recovered all that<br>the aA malekites had carried away:<br>and David rescued his two wives.<br>19 And there was nothing lacking<br>to them, neither small nor great,<br>neither sons nor daughters, neither<br>spoil, nor any thing that they had<br>taken to them: David recovered all.<br>20 And David took all the flocks<br>and the herds, which they drave<br>before those other cattle, and said,<br>This is David’s spoil.<br>21 ¶ And David came to the two<br>hundred men, which were so faint<br>that they could not follow David,<br>whom they had made also to abide<br>at the brook Besor: and they went<br>forth to meet David, and to meet<br>the people that were with him: and<br>when David came near to the peo-<br>ple, he saluted them.<br>22 Then answered all the wicked<br>men and men of Belial, of those that<br>went with David, and said, Because<br>they went not with us, we will not<br>give them ought of the spoil that we<br>have recovered, save to every man<br>his wife and his children, that they<br>may lead them away, and depart.<br>23 Then said David, Ye shall not<br>do so, my brethren, with that which<br>the LORD hath given us, who hath<br>preserved us, and delivered the|Col2|company that came against us into<br>our hand.<br>24 For who will hearken unto you<br>in this matter? but as his part is<br>that goeth down to the battle, so<br>shall his part be that tarrieth by the<br>stuff: they a shall part alike.<br>25 And it was so from that day<br>forward, that he made it a statute<br>and an ordinance for Israel unto<br>this day.<br>26 ¶ And when David came to<br>Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the<br>elders of Judah, even to his friends,<br>saying, Behold a present for you of<br>the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;<br>27 To them which were in Beth-el,<br>and to them which were in south<br>Ramoth, and to them which were<br>in Jattir,<br>28 And to them which were in<br>Aroer, and to them which were in<br>Siphmoth, and to them which were<br>in Eshtemoa,<br>29 And to them which were in<br>Rachal, and to them which were in<br>the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and<br>to them which were in the cities of<br>the Kenites,<br>30 And to them which were in<br>Hormah, and to them which were<br>in Chor-ashan, and to them which<br>were in Athach,<br>31 And to them which were in He-<br>bron, and to all the places where<br>David himself and his men a were<br>wont to haunt.<br>CHAPTER 31<br>The Philistines defeat Israel—Saul and<br>his three sons are slain—Their bodies are<br>retrieved by the Gileadites and burned.<br>NOW the a Philistines fought against<br>Israel: and the men of Israel fled<br>from before the Philistines, and fell<br>down slain in mount Gilboa.<br>2 And the Philistines followed<br>hard upon Saul and upon his sons;<br>and the Philistines slew Jonathan,<br>and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua,<br>Saul’s sons.|Col4|
