oblation; and the sanctuary of the
house _shall be_ in the midst thereof.
22 Moreover from the possession of
the Levites, and from the possession
of the city, _being_ in the midst _of that_
which is the prince’s, between the
border of Judah and the border of
Benjamin, shall be for the prince.
23 As for the rest of the tribes,
from the east side unto the west
side, Benjamin _shall have_ a _portion._
24 And by the border of Benjamin,
from the east side unto the west side,
Simeon _shall have_ a _portion._
25 And by the border of Simeon,
from the east side unto the west
side, Issachar a _portion._
26 And by the border of Issachar,
from the east side unto the west
side, Zebulun a _portion._
27 And by the border of Zebulun,
from the east side unto the west
side, Gad a _portion._
28 And by the border of Gad, at
the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar _unto_
the waters of _**[a ]**_ strife _in_ Kadesh, _and_
to the river toward the great sea.
29 This _is_ the land which ye shall



divide by lot unto the tribes of
Israel for _**[a ]**_ inheritance, and these
_are_ their portions, saith the Lord
GOD.
30 ¶ And these _are_ the goings out of
the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.
31 And the _**[a ]**_ gates of the _**[b ]**_ city _shall_
_be_ after the names of the tribes of
Israel: three gates northward; one
gate of _**[c ]**_ Reuben, one gate of Judah,
one gate of Levi.
32 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
gates; and one gate of Joseph, one
gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan.
33 And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:
and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one gate
of Zebulun.
34 At the west side four thousand
and five hundred, _with_ their three
gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of
Asher, one gate of Naphtali.
35 _It was_ round about eighteen
thousand _measures:_ _**[a ]**_ and the name
of the city from _that_ day _shall be,_
The LORD _is_ there.

The king spake, and said,<br>Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or<br>the interpretation thereof, trouble<br>thee. Belteshazzar answered and<br>said, My lord, the dream be to them<br>that hate thee, and the interpreta-<br>tion thereof to thine enemies.<br>20 The tree that thou sawest, which<br>grew, and was strong, whose height<br>reached unto the heaven, and the<br>sight thereof to all the earth;<br>21 Whose leaves were fair, and the<br>fruit thereof much, and in it was<br>meat for all; under which the beasts<br>of the field dwelt, and upon whose<br>branches the fowls of the heaven<br>had their habitation:<br>22 It is thou, O king, that art grown<br>and become strong: for thy great-<br>ness is grown, and reacheth unto<br>heaven, and thy a dominion to the<br>end of the earth.<br>23 And whereas the king saw a<br>watcher and an holy one coming<br>down from heaven, and saying, Hew<br>the tree down, and destroy it; yet<br>leave the stump of the roots thereof<br>in the earth, even with a band of<br>iron and brass, in the tender grass<br>of the field; and let it be wet with<br>the dew of heaven, and let his por-<br>tion be with the beasts of the field,<br>till seven times pass over him;<br>24 This is the interpretation, O<br>king, and this is the decree of the<br>most High, which is come upon my<br>lord the king:<br>25 That they shall drive thee from<br>men, and thy dwelling shall be<br>with the beasts of the field, and<br>they shall make thee to eat grass<br>as oxen, and they shall wet thee<br>with the dew of heaven, and seven<br>times shall pass over thee, till thou<br>know that the most High ruleth in|Col2|the kingdom of men, and giveth it<br>to whomsoever he will.<br>26 And whereas they commanded<br>to leave the stump of the tree roots;<br>thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee,<br>after that thou shalt have known<br>that the heavens do rule.<br>27 Wherefore, O king, let my coun-<br>sel be acceptable unto thee, and<br>break off thy sins by righteousness,<br>and thine iniquities by shewing<br>a mercy to the poor; b if it may be<br>a lengthening of thy tranquillity.<br>28 ¶ All this came upon the king<br>Nebuchadnezzar.<br>29 At the end of twelve months he<br>walked in the palace of the king-<br>dom of Babylon.<br>30 The king spake, and said, Is not<br>this great Babylon, that I have built<br>a for the house of the kingdom by<br>the might of my power, and for the<br>honour of my majesty ?<br>31 While the word was in the<br>king’s mouth, there fell a voice from<br>heaven, saying, O king Nebuchad-<br>nezzar, to thee it is spoken; The<br>kingdom is a departed from thee.<br>32 And they shall drive thee from<br>men, and thy dwelling shall be with<br>the beasts of the field: they shall<br>make thee to eat grass as oxen, and<br>seven times shall pass over thee, un-<br>til thou know that the most High<br>ruleth in the kingdom of men, and<br>giveth it to whomsoever he will.<br>33 The same hour was the thing<br>fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and<br>he was driven from men, and did<br>eat grass as oxen, and his body was<br>wet with the dew of heaven, till his<br>hairs were grown like eagles’ feath-<br>ers, and his nails like birds’ claws.<br>34 And at the end of a the days I<br>Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine<br>eyes unto heaven, and mine un-<br>derstanding returned unto me, and<br>I blessed the most High, and I<br>praised and honoured him that<br>liveth for ever, whose dominion is<br>an everlasting dominion, and his|Col4|

And the king spake<br>and said unto Daniel, Art thou that<br>Daniel, which art of the children of<br>the captivity of Judah, whom the<br>king my father brought out of Jewry ?<br>14 I have even heard of thee, that<br>the spirit of the a gods is in thee, and<br>that light and understanding and<br>excellent wisdom is found in thee.<br>15 And now the wise men, the a as-<br>trologers, have been brought in be-<br>fore me, that they should read this<br>writing, and make known unto me<br>the interpretation thereof: but they<br>could not shew the interpretation<br>of the thing:<br>16 And I have heard of thee, that<br>thou canst make interpretations,<br>and dissolve doubts: now if thou<br>canst read the a writing, and make<br>b known to me the interpretation<br>thereof, thou shalt be clothed with<br>scarlet, and have a chain of gold<br>about thy neck, and shalt be the<br>third ruler in the kingdom.<br>17 ¶ Then Daniel answered and<br>said before the king, Let thy a gifts<br>be to thyself, and give thy rewards<br>to another; yet I will read the writ-<br>ing unto the king, and make known<br>to him the interpretation.<br>18 O thou king, the most high God<br>gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a<br>kingdom, and majesty, and glory,<br>and honour:<br>19 And for the majesty that he<br>gave him, all people, nations, and<br>languages, trembled and feared|Col2|before him: whom he would he<br>slew; and whom he would he kept<br>alive; and whom he would he set up;<br>and whom he would he put down.<br>20 But when his a heart was lifted<br>up, and his b mind hardened in<br>pride, he was c deposed from his<br>kingly throne, and they took his<br>glory from him:<br>21 And he was driven a from the<br>sons of men; and his heart was<br>made like the beasts, and his dwell-<br>ing was with the wild asses: they<br>fed him with grass like oxen, and<br>his body was wet with the dew of<br>heaven; till he knew that the most<br>high God ruled in the kingdom of<br>men, and that he appointeth over<br>it whomsoever he will.<br>22 And thou his son, O Belshaz-<br>zar, hast not humbled thine heart,<br>though thou knewest all this;<br>23 But hast lifted up thyself against<br>the Lord of heaven; and they have<br>brought the vessels of his house be-<br>fore thee, and thou, and thy lords,<br>thy wives, and thy concubines,<br>have drunk wine in them; and thou<br>hast praised the a gods of silver,<br>and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and<br>stone, which see not, nor hear, nor<br>know: and the God in whose hand<br>thy breath is, and whose are all thy<br>ways, hast thou not glorified:<br>24 Then was the part of the hand<br>sent from him; and this writing<br>was written.<br>25 ¶ And this is the writing that<br>was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,<br>UPHARSIN.<br>26 This is the interpretation of the<br>thing: a MENE; God hath b numbered<br>thy kingdom, and finished it.<br>27 a TEKEL; Thou art b weighed in<br>the balances, and art found wanting.<br>28 a PERES; Thy kingdom is di-<br>vided, and given to the Medes and<br>b Persians.|Col4|

|Daniel to deliver him: and he la-<br>boured till the going down of the<br>sun to deliver him.<br>15 Then these men assembled<br>unto the king, and said unto the<br>king, Know, O king, that the law of<br>the Medes and Persians is, That no<br>decree nor statute which the king<br>establisheth may be changed.<br>16 Then the king commanded, and<br>they brought Daniel, and cast him<br>into the den of lions. Now the king<br>spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God<br>whom thou servest continually, he<br>will deliver thee.<br>17 And a stone was brought, and<br>laid upon the mouth of the den;<br>and the king a sealed it with his<br>own signet, and with the signet of<br>his lords; that the purpose might<br>not be changed concerning Daniel.<br>18 ¶ Then the king went to his<br>palace, and passed the night fast-<br>ing: neither were instruments of<br>musick brought before him: and<br>his sleep went from him.<br>19 Then the king arose very early<br>in the morning, and went in haste<br>unto the den of lions.<br>20 And when he came to the den,<br>he cried with a lamentable voice<br>unto Daniel: and the king spake<br>and said to Daniel, O Daniel, a ser-<br>vant of the living God, is thy God,<br>whom thou servest continually,<br>able to deliver thee from the lions?<br>21 Then said Daniel unto the king,<br>O king, live for ever.<br>22 My God hath sent his a angel,<br>and hath shut the b lions’ mouths,<br>that they have not hurt me: foras-<br>much as before him innocency was<br>found in me; and also before thee,<br>O king, have I done no hurt.<br>23 Then was the king exceeding<br>glad for him, and commanded that<br>they should take Daniel up out of<br>the den.
