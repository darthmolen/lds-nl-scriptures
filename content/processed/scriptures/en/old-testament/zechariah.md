HAGGAI 2:21–ZECHARIAH 1:11 1168



LORD came unto Haggai in the four
and twentieth _day_ of the month,
saying,
21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor
of Judah, saying, I will shake the
heavens and the _**[a ]**_ earth;
22 And I will _**[a ]**_ overthrow the throne
of kingdoms, and I will destroy
the strength of the kingdoms of
the heathen; and I will overthrow



the chariots, and those that ride
in them; and the _**[b ]**_ horses and their
riders shall come down, every one
by the sword of his _**[c ]**_ brother.
23 In that day, saith the LORD of
hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,
saith the LORD, and will make thee
as _**[a ]**_ a signet: for I have _**[b ]**_ chosen thee,
saith the LORD of hosts.

|hosts: smite the b shepherd, and the<br>c sheep shall be d scattered: and I will<br>turn mine hand upon the little ones.<br>8 And it shall come to pass, that<br>in all the land, saith the LORD, two<br>parts therein shall be cut off and die;<br>but the third shall be a left therein.<br>9 And I will bring the third part<br>through the fire, and will a refine<br>them as silver is refined, and will<br>b try them as gold is c tried: they shall<br>call on my name, and I will hear<br>them: I will say, It is my d people: and<br>they shall say, The LORD is my God.<br>CHAPTER 14<br>At His Second Coming, the Lord will<br>fight for Israel—His feet will stand<br>upon the Mount of Olives—He will be<br>King over all the earth—Plagues will<br>destroy the wicked.<br>BEHOLD, the a day of the LORD<br>cometh, and thy spoil shall be di-<br>vided in the midst of thee.<br>2 For I will gather all nations<br>against Jerusalem to a battle; and<br>the city shall be taken, and the<br>b houses rifled, and the women rav-<br>ished; and half of the city shall go<br>forth into captivity, and the residue<br>of the people shall not be cut off<br>from the city.<br>3 Then shall the LORD go forth,<br>and a fight against those nations, as<br>when he fought in the day of battle.<br>4 ¶ And his a feet shall b stand in<br>that day upon the c mount of Olives,<br>which is before Jerusalem on the<br>east, and the mount of Olives shall<br>cleave in the midst thereof toward<br>the east and toward the west, and|Col2|there shall be a very great valley; and<br>half of the mountain shall remove<br>toward the north, and half of it to-<br>ward the south.<br>5 And ye shall flee to the valley of<br>the mountains; for the valley of the<br>mountains shall reach unto Azal:<br>yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled<br>from before the a earthquake in the<br>days of Uzziah king of Judah: and<br>the LORD my God shall come, and<br>all the b saints with thee.<br>6 And it shall come to pass in that<br>day, that the a light shall not be clear,<br>nor dark:<br>7 But it shall be one day which shall<br>be known to the LORD, not day, nor<br>night: but it shall come to pass, that<br>at evening time it shall be light.<br>8 And it shall be in that day, that<br>a living b waters shall go out from<br>Jerusalem; half of them toward the<br>former sea, and half of them toward<br>the hinder sea: in summer and in<br>winter shall it be.<br>9 And the LORD shall be a king over<br>all the earth: in that day shall there<br>be one LORD, and his name one.<br>10 All the land shall be turned as a<br>a plain from Geba to Rimmon south<br>of Jerusalem: and b it shall be lifted<br>up, and inhabited in her c place, from<br>Benjamin’s gate unto the place of<br>the first gate, unto the corner gate,<br>and from the tower of Hananeel unto<br>the king’s winepresses.<br>11 And men shall dwell in it, and<br>there shall be no more utter de-<br>struction; but Jerusalem shall be<br>safely inhabited.<br>12 ¶ And this shall be the a plague<br>wherewith the LORD will b smite all|Col4|
