**THE THIRD BOOK OF THE KINGS**












|CHAPTER 1<br>Abishag cherishes David in his extreme<br>age—Adonijah aspires to be king—<br>Bathsheba and Nathan advise David<br>of Adonijah’s plotting—David names<br>Solomon as king, and he is anointed by<br>Zadok—Adonijah’s cause fails.<br>N<br>OW king David was old and<br>stricken in years; and they<br>covered him with clothes,<br>but he gat no heat.<br>2 Wherefore his servants said unto<br>him, Let there be sought for my<br>lord the king a young virgin: and<br>let her stand before the king, and let<br>her a cherish him, and let her lie in<br>thy bosom, that my lord the king<br>may get heat.<br>3 So they sought for a fair damsel<br>throughout all the a coasts of Israel,<br>and found bA bishag a Shunammite,<br>and brought her to the king.<br>4 And the damsel was very fair, and<br>cherished the king, and ministered<br>to him: but the king knew her not.<br>5 ¶ Then aA donijah the son of<br>Haggith exalted himself, saying, I<br>will be king: and he prepared him<br>chariots and horsemen, and fifty<br>men to run before him.<br>6 And his father had not displeased<br>him at any time in saying, Why<br>hast thou done so? and he also was<br>a very a goodly man; and his mother<br>bare him after bA bsalom.<br>7 And he conferred with Joab the<br>son of Zeruiah, and with aA biathar<br>the priest: and they following bA do-<br>nijah helped him.|Col2|8 But Zadok the priest, and Be-<br>naiah the son of Jehoiada, and Na-<br>than the prophet, and Shimei, and<br>Rei, and the mighty men which<br>belonged to David, were not with<br>Adonijah.<br>9 And Adonijah slew sheep and<br>oxen and fat cattle by the stone of<br>Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and<br>called all his brethren the king’s<br>sons, and all the men of Judah the<br>king’s servants:<br>10 But Nathan the prophet, and<br>Benaiah, and the mighty men,<br>and Solomon his brother, he called<br>not.<br>11 ¶ Wherefore Nathan spake unto<br>Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon,<br>saying, Hast thou not heard that<br>Adonijah the son of Haggith doth<br>reign, and David our lord knoweth<br>it not?<br>12 Now therefore come, let me, I<br>pray thee, give thee counsel, that<br>thou mayest save thine own life,<br>and the life of thy son Solomon.<br>13 Go and get thee in unto king<br>David, and say unto him, Didst not<br>thou, my lord, O king, swear unto<br>thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly<br>a Solomon thy son shall reign af-<br>ter me, and he shall sit upon my<br>throne? why then doth Adonijah<br>reign?<br>14 Behold, while thou yet talkest<br>there with the king, I also will come<br>in after thee, and confirm thy words.<br>15 ¶ And Bath-sheba went in unto<br>the king into the chamber: and the<br>king was very old; and Abishag the|Col4|

|Shunammite ministered unto the<br>king.<br>16 And Bath-sheba bowed, and<br>did obeisance unto the king. And<br>the king said, What wouldest thou?<br>17 And she said unto him, My<br>lord, thou a swarest by the LORD thy<br>God unto thine handmaid, saying,<br>Assuredly Solomon thy son shall<br>reign after me, and he shall sit upon<br>my throne.<br>18 And now, behold, Adonijah<br>reigneth; and now, my lord the king,<br>thou knowest it not:<br>19 And he hath slain oxen and fat<br>cattle and sheep in abundance, and<br>hath called all the sons of the king,<br>and Abiathar the priest, and Joab<br>the captain of the host: but Solo-<br>mon thy servant hath he not called.<br>20 And thou, my lord, O king, the<br>eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that<br>thou shouldest tell them who shall<br>sit on the throne of my lord the<br>king after him.<br>21 Otherwise it shall come to pass,<br>when my lord the king shall sleep<br>with his fathers, that I and my son<br>Solomon shall be counted offenders.<br>22 ¶ And, lo, while she yet talked<br>with the king, Nathan the prophet<br>also came in.<br>23 And they told the king, saying,<br>Behold Nathan the prophet. And<br>when he was come in before the<br>king, he bowed himself before the<br>king with his face to the ground.<br>24 And Nathan said, My lord, O<br>king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall<br>reign after me, and he shall sit upon<br>my throne?<br>25 For he is gone down this day,<br>and hath slain oxen and fat cattle<br>and sheep in abundance, and hath<br>called all the king’s sons, and the<br>captains of the host, and Abiathar<br>the priest; and, behold, they eat and<br>drink before him, and say, a God<br>save king Adonijah.<br>26 But me, even me thy servant,<br>and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah|Col2|the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant<br>Solomon, hath he not called.<br>27 Is this thing done by my lord<br>the king, and thou hast not shewed<br>it unto thy servant, who should sit<br>on the throne of my lord the king<br>after him?<br>28 ¶ Then king David answered<br>and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And<br>she came into the king’s presence,<br>and stood before the king.<br>29 And the king sware, and said,<br>As the LORD liveth, that hath re-<br>deemed my soul out of all distress,<br>30 Even as I sware unto thee by<br>the LORD God of Israel, saying, As-<br>suredly Solomon thy son shall reign<br>after me, and he shall sit upon my<br>throne in my stead; even so will I<br>certainly do this day.<br>31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with<br>her face to the earth, and did rever-<br>ence to the king, and said, Let my<br>lord king David live for ever.<br>32 ¶ And king David said, Call<br>me Zadok the priest, and Nathan<br>the prophet, and Benaiah the son<br>of Jehoiada. And they came before<br>the king.<br>33 The king also said unto them,<br>Take with you the servants of your<br>lord, and cause Solomon my son<br>to ride upon mine own mule, and<br>bring him down to a Gihon:<br>34 And let Zadok the priest and<br>Nathan the prophet a anoint him<br>there b king over Israel: and blow<br>ye with the trumpet, and say, c God<br>save king Solomon.<br>35 Then ye shall come up after him,<br>that he may come and sit upon my<br>throne; for he shall be king in my<br>stead: and I have appointed him to<br>be ruler over Israel and over Judah.<br>36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoi-<br>ada answered the king, and said,<br>Amen: the LORD God of my lord<br>the king say so too.<br>37 As the LORD hath been with<br>my lord the king, even so be he<br>with Solomon, and make his throne|Col4|

And they<br>blew the trumpet; and all the peo-<br>ple said, God save king Solomon.<br>40 And all the people came up<br>after him, and the people piped<br>with pipes, and rejoiced with great<br>joy, so that the earth rent with the<br>sound of them.<br>41 ¶ And Adonijah and all the<br>guests that were with him heard it<br>as they had made an end of eating.<br>And when Joab heard the sound of<br>the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is<br>this noise of the city being in an<br>uproar?<br>42 And while he yet spake, behold,<br>a Jonathan the son of Abiathar the<br>priest came: and Adonijah said unto<br>him, Come in; for thou art a valiant<br>man, and bringest good tidings.<br>43 And Jonathan answered and<br>said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king<br>David hath made Solomon king.<br>44 And the king hath sent with<br>him Zadok the priest, and Nathan<br>the prophet, and Benaiah the son of<br>Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and<br>the Pelethites, and they have caused<br>him to ride upon the king’s mule:<br>45 And Zadok the priest and Na-<br>than the prophet have anointed<br>him king in Gihon: and they are<br>come up from thence rejoicing, so<br>that the city rang again. This is the<br>noise that ye have heard.<br>46 And also Solomon sitteth on<br>the throne of the kingdom.<br>47 And moreover the king’s ser-<br>vants came to bless our lord king|Col2|David, saying, God make the name<br>of Solomon better than thy name,<br>and make his throne greater than<br>thy throne. And the king bowed<br>himself upon the a bed.<br>48 And also thus said the king,<br>Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,<br>which hath given one to sit on my<br>throne this day, mine eyes even<br>seeing it.<br>49 And all the guests that were with<br>Adonijah were afraid, and rose up,<br>and went every man his way.<br>50 ¶ And Adonijah feared because<br>of Solomon, and arose, and went,<br>and caught hold on the a horns of<br>the altar.<br>51 And it was told Solomon, say-<br>ing, Behold, Adonijah feareth king<br>Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught<br>hold on the horns of the altar, say-<br>ing, Let king Solomon swear unto<br>me to day that he will not slay his<br>servant with the sword.<br>52 And Solomon said, If he will<br>shew himself a worthy man, there<br>shall not an hair of him fall to the<br>earth: but if wickedness shall be<br>found in him, he shall die.<br>53 So king Solomon sent, and they<br>brought him down from the altar.<br>And he came and bowed himself<br>to king Solomon: and Solomon said<br>unto him, Go to thine house.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>David charges Solomon to keep the<br>commandments and walk in the ways<br>of the Lord—King David dies and<br>Solomon reigns—Adonijah, Joab, and<br>Shimei are put to death, and Abiathar<br>is rejected as high priest—The kingdom<br>is established with Solomon.<br>NOW the days of David drew nigh<br>that he should die; and he charged<br>a Solomon his son, saying,<br>2 I go the a way of all the earth:<br>be thou strong therefore, and shew<br>thyself a b man;|Col4|

|3 And keep the charge of the LORD<br>thy God, to a walk in his ways, to<br>keep his statutes, and his b com-<br>mandments, and his judgments, and<br>his testimonies, as it is written in<br>the law of Moses, that thou mayest<br>c prosper in all that thou doest, and<br>whithersoever thou turnest thyself:<br>4 That the LORD may continue his<br>word which he spake concerning<br>me, saying, If thy a children take<br>b heed to their way, to walk before<br>me in truth with all their c heart<br>and with all their soul, there shall<br>not fail thee (said he) a man on the<br>d throne of Israel.<br>5 Moreover thou knowest also what<br>a Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,<br>and what he did to the two captains<br>of the hosts of Israel, unto bA bner<br>the son of Ner, and unto cA masa the<br>son of Jether, whom he slew, and<br>shed the blood of war in peace,<br>and put the blood of war upon his<br>girdle that was about his loins, and<br>in his shoes that were on his feet.<br>6 Do therefore according to thy<br>wisdom, and let not his hoar head<br>go down to the grave in peace.<br>7 But shew kindness unto the sons<br>of a Barzillai the Gileadite, and let<br>them be of those that eat at thy ta-<br>ble: for so they came to me when I<br>fled because of Absalom thy brother.<br>8 And, behold, thou hast with thee<br>a Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite<br>of Bahurim, which cursed me with<br>a grievous curse in the day when<br>I went to Mahanaim: but he came<br>down to meet me at Jordan, and I<br>sware to him by the LORD, saying,<br>I will not put thee to death with<br>the sword.<br>9 Now therefore hold him not guilt-<br>less: for thou art a wise man, and<br>knowest what thou oughtest to do<br>unto him; but his hoar head bring<br>thou down to the grave with blood.<br>10 So David slept with his fathers,|Col2|and was a buried in the b city of<br>David.<br>11 And the days that David a reigned<br>over Israel were forty years: seven<br>years reigned he in Hebron, and<br>thirty and three years reigned he<br>in Jerusalem.<br>12 ¶ Then sat a Solomon upon the<br>throne of David his father; and his<br>kingdom was established greatly.<br>13 ¶ And Adonijah the son of<br>Haggith came to Bath-sheba the<br>mother of Solomon. And she said,<br>Comest thou peaceably ? And he<br>said, Peaceably.<br>14 He said moreover, I have some-<br>what to say unto thee. And she<br>said, Say on.<br>15 And he said, Thou knowest<br>that the a kingdom was mine, and<br>that all Israel set their faces on<br>me, that I should reign: howbeit<br>the kingdom is turned about, and<br>is become my brother’s: for it was<br>his from the LORD.<br>16 And now I ask one petition of<br>thee, deny me not. And she said unto<br>him, Say on.<br>17 And he said, Speak, I pray<br>thee, unto Solomon the king, (for<br>he will not say thee nay,) that he<br>give me aA bishag the Shunammite<br>to wife.<br>18 And Bath-sheba said, Well; I<br>will speak for thee unto the king.<br>19 ¶ Bath-sheba therefore went<br>unto king Solomon, to speak unto<br>him for Adonijah. And the king<br>rose up to meet her, and bowed<br>himself unto her, and sat down on<br>his throne, and caused a seat to be<br>set for the king’s mother; and she<br>sat on his right hand.<br>20 Then she said, I desire one<br>small petition of thee; I pray thee,<br>say me not nay.

|Shunammite be given to Adonijah<br>thy brother to wife.<br>22 And king Solomon answered<br>and said unto his mother, And why<br>dost thou ask Abishag the Shunam-<br>mite for Adonijah? ask for him the<br>kingdom also; for he is mine elder<br>a brother; even for him, and for<br>bA biathar the priest, and for Joab<br>the son of Zeruiah.<br>23 Then king Solomon sware by the<br>LORD, saying, God do so to me, and<br>more also, if Adonijah have not spo-<br>ken this word against his own life.<br>24 Now therefore, as the LORD<br>liveth, which hath established me,<br>and set me on the throne of David<br>my father, and who hath made me<br>an house, as he promised, Adoni-<br>jah shall be put to a death this day.<br>25 And king Solomon sent by the<br>hand of a Benaiah the son of Jehoi-<br>ada; and he fell upon him that he<br>died.<br>26 ¶ And unto aA biathar the priest<br>said the king, Get thee to bA nathoth,<br>unto thine own fields; for thou art<br>worthy of death: but I will not at<br>this time put thee to death, because<br>thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD<br>before David my father, and be-<br>cause thou hast been afflicted in<br>all wherein my father was afflicted.<br>27 So Solomon thrust out aA biathar<br>from being priest unto the LORD;<br>that he might b fulfil the word of the<br>LORD, which he spake concerning<br>the house of Eli in Shiloh.<br>28 ¶ Then tidings came to a Joab:<br>for Joab had turned after bA donijah,<br>though he turned not after Absalom.<br>And Joab fled unto the tabernacle<br>of the LORD, and caught hold on<br>the c horns of the altar.<br>29 And it was told king Solomon<br>that Joab was fled unto the taber-<br>nacle of the LORD; and, behold, he<br>is by the altar. Then Solomon sent|Col2|Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, say-<br>ing, Go, fall upon him.<br>30 And Benaiah came to the tab-<br>ernacle of the LORD, and said unto<br>him, Thus saith the king, Come<br>forth. And he said, Nay; but I will<br>die here. And Benaiah brought the<br>king word again, saying, Thus said<br>Joab, and thus he answered me.<br>31 And the king said unto him, Do<br>as he hath said, and fall upon him,<br>and bury him; that thou mayest take<br>away the a innocent blood, which<br>Joab shed, from me, and from the<br>house of my father.<br>32 And the LORD shall return his<br>blood upon his own head, who fell<br>upon two men more righteous and<br>better than he, and slew them with<br>the sword, my father David not<br>knowing thereof, to wit, aA bner the<br>son of Ner, captain of the host of<br>Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,<br>captain of the host of Judah.<br>33 Their blood shall therefore re-<br>turn upon the head of a Joab, and<br>upon the head of his seed for ever:<br>but upon David, and upon his seed,<br>and upon his house, and upon his<br>throne, shall there be peace for ever<br>from the LORD.<br>34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada<br>went up, and fell upon him, and<br>slew him: and he was buried in his<br>own house in the wilderness.<br>35 ¶ And the king put a Benaiah the<br>son of Jehoiada in his room over the<br>b host: and c Zadok the d priest did the<br>king put in the room of Abiathar.<br>36 ¶ And the king sent and called<br>for a Shimei, and said unto him,<br>Build thee an house in Jerusalem,<br>and dwell there, and go not forth<br>thence any whither.<br>37 For it shall be, that on the day<br>thou goest out, and passest over the<br>brook Kidron, thou shalt know for<br>certain that thou shalt surely die:|Col4|

|thy blood shall be upon thine own<br>head.<br>38 And Shimei said unto the king,<br>The saying is good: as my lord the<br>king hath said, so will thy servant<br>do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem<br>many days.<br>39 And it came to pass at the end of<br>three years, that two of the servants<br>of Shimei ran away unto aA chish<br>son of Maachah king of Gath. And<br>they told Shimei, saying, Behold,<br>thy servants be in Gath.<br>40 And Shimei arose, and saddled<br>his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to<br>seek his servants: and Shimei went,<br>and brought his servants from Gath.<br>41 And it was told Solomon that<br>Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to<br>Gath, and was come again.<br>42 And the king sent and called<br>for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I<br>not make thee to swear by the LORD,<br>and a protested unto thee, saying,<br>Know for a certain, on the day thou<br>goest out, and walkest abroad any<br>whither, that thou shalt surely die?<br>and thou saidst unto me, The word<br>that I have heard is good.<br>43 Why then hast thou not kept<br>the oath of the LORD, and the com-<br>mandment that I have charged thee<br>with?<br>44 The king said moreover to<br>Shimei, Thou knowest all the a wick-<br>edness which thine heart b is privy to,<br>that thou didst to David my father:<br>therefore the LORD shall return thy<br>wickedness upon thine own head;<br>45 And king Solomon shall be bless-<br>ed, and the throne of David shall be<br>established before the LORD for ever.<br>46 So the king commanded Be-<br>naiah the son of Jehoiada; which<br>went out, and fell upon him, that<br>he a died.

And he came to king<br>Solomon, and b wrought all his work.<br>15 For he cast two a pillars of brass,<br>of eighteen cubits high apiece: and<br>a line of twelve b cubits did compass<br>either of them about.<br>16 And he made two a chapiters of<br>molten brass, to set upon the tops<br>of the pillars: the height of the one<br>chapiter was five cubits, and the<br>height of the other chapiter was<br>five cubits:<br>17 And nets of checker work, and<br>wreaths of chain work, for the chapi-<br>ters which were upon the top of the<br>pillars; seven for the one chapiter,<br>and seven for the other chapiter.<br>18 And he made the pillars, and<br>two rows round about upon the one<br>network, to cover the chapiters that<br>were upon the top, with pomegran-<br>ates: and so did he for the other<br>chapiter.<br>19 And the chapiters that were<br>upon the top of the pillars were of<br>lily work in the porch, four cubits.|Col2|20 And the chapiters upon the two<br>pillars had pomegranates also above,<br>over against the belly which was by<br>the network: and the pomegranates<br>were a two hundred in rows round<br>about upon the other chapiter.<br>21 And he set up the a pillars in<br>the porch of the temple: and he set<br>up the right pillar, and called the<br>name thereof Jachin: and he set up<br>the left pillar, and called the name<br>thereof Boaz.<br>22 And upon the top of the pillars<br>was lily work: so was the work of<br>the pillars finished.<br>23 ¶ And he made a molten a sea,<br>ten cubits from the one brim to<br>the other: it was round all about,<br>and his height was five cubits: and<br>a line of thirty cubits did compass<br>it round about.<br>24 And under the brim of it round<br>about there were knops compassing<br>it, ten in a cubit, compassing the<br>sea round about: the knops were<br>cast in two rows, when it was cast.<br>25 It stood upon a twelve oxen,<br>three looking toward the north, and<br>three looking toward the west, and<br>three looking toward the south, and<br>three looking toward the east: and<br>the sea was set above upon them, and<br>all their hinder parts were inward.<br>26 And it was an hand breadth<br>thick, and the brim thereof was<br>wrought like the brim of a cup,<br>with flowers of lilies: it contained<br>two a thousand baths.<br>27 ¶ And he made ten a bases of<br>brass; four cubits was the length<br>of one base, and four cubits the<br>breadth thereof, and three cubits<br>the height of it.<br>28 And the work of the bases was<br>on this manner: they had borders,<br>and the borders were between the<br>ledges:<br>29 And on the borders that were<br>between the ledges were lions, oxen,|Col4|

|22 But the word of God came unto<br>a Shemaiah the man of God, saying,<br>23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son<br>of Solomon, king of Judah, and<br>unto all the house of Judah and<br>Benjamin, and to the remnant of<br>the people, saying,<br>24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall<br>not go up, nor fight against your<br>a brethren the children of Israel: re-<br>turn every man to his house; for this<br>thing is from me. They hearkened<br>therefore to the word of the LORD,<br>and returned to depart, according<br>to the word of the LORD.<br>25 ¶ Then Jeroboam built She-<br>chem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt<br>therein; and went out from thence,<br>and built Penuel.<br>26 And Jeroboam said in his heart,<br>Now shall the kingdom return to<br>the house of David:<br>27 If this people a go up to do sac-<br>rifice in the house of the LORD at<br>Jerusalem, then shall the heart of<br>this people turn again unto their<br>lord, even unto Rehoboam king<br>of Judah, and they shall kill me,<br>and go again to Rehoboam king of<br>Judah.<br>28 Whereupon the king took coun-<br>sel, and a made two b calves of gold,<br>and said unto them, It is too much<br>for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold<br>thy c gods, O Israel, which brought<br>thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br>29 And he set the one in Beth-el,<br>and the other put he in a Dan.<br>30 And this thing became a sin: for<br>the people went to worship before<br>the one, even unto Dan.<br>31 And he made an a house of high<br>places, and made b priests of the<br>lowest of the people, which were<br>not of the sons of Levi.<br>32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast<br>in the eighth month, on the fif-<br>teenth day of the month, like unto<br>the a feast that is in Judah, and he|Col2|offered upon the altar. So did he in<br>Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves<br>that he had made: and he placed<br>in Beth-el the b priests of the high<br>places which he had made.<br>33 So he offered upon the altar<br>which he had made in Beth-el the<br>fifteenth day of the eighth month,<br>even in the month which he had<br>devised of his own heart; and or-<br>dained a feast unto the children<br>of Israel: and he offered upon the<br>altar, and burnt incense.<br>CHAPTER 13<br>Jeroboam is smitten and then healed<br>by a prophet from Judah—The prophet<br>delivers his message, is led astray<br>by a prophet from Bethel, and is<br>slain by a lion for his disobedience—<br>Jeroboam continues false worship in<br>Israel.<br>AND, behold, there came a man of<br>God out of Judah by the word of<br>the LORD unto Beth-el: and Jero-<br>boam stood by the altar to burn<br>incense.<br>2 And he cried against the altar<br>in the word of the LORD, and said,<br>O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD;<br>Behold, a child shall be born unto<br>the house of David, Josiah by name;<br>and upon thee shall he offer the<br>priests of the a high places that burn<br>incense upon thee, and men’s bones<br>shall be b burnt upon thee.<br>3 And he gave a sign the same<br>day, saying, This is the sign which<br>the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the<br>altar shall be a rent, and the ashes<br>that are upon it shall be poured out.<br>4 And it came to pass, when king<br>Jeroboam heard the saying of the<br>man of God, which had cried against<br>the altar in Beth-el, that he put<br>forth his hand from the altar, say-<br>ing, Lay hold on him.

And the man<br>of God besought the LORD, and the<br>king’s hand was restored him again,<br>and became as it was before.<br>7 And the king said unto the man<br>of God, Come home with me, and<br>refresh thyself, and I will give thee<br>a reward.<br>8 And the man of God said unto<br>the king, If thou wilt give me half<br>thine house, I will not go in with<br>thee, neither will I eat bread nor<br>drink water in this place:<br>9 For so was it charged me by the<br>word of the LORD, saying, Eat no<br>bread, nor drink water, nor turn<br>again by the same way that thou<br>camest.<br>10 So he went another way, and<br>returned not by the way that he<br>came to Beth-el.<br>11 ¶ Now there dwelt an old<br>prophet in Beth-el; and his sons<br>came and told him all the works<br>that the man of God had done that<br>day in Beth-el: the words which he<br>had spoken unto the king, them<br>they told also to their father.<br>12 And their father said unto<br>them, What way went he? For his<br>sons had seen what way the man of<br>God went, which came from Judah.<br>13 And he said unto his sons, Sad-<br>dle me the ass. So they saddled him<br>the ass: and he rode thereon,<br>14 And went after the man of God,<br>and found him sitting under an oak:<br>and he said unto him, Art thou the<br>man of God that camest from Ju-<br>dah?

But he lied<br>unto him.<br>19 So he went back with him, and<br>did eat bread in his house, and<br>drank water.<br>20 ¶ And it came to pass, as they<br>sat at the table, that the word of the<br>LORD came unto the prophet that<br>brought him back:<br>21 And he cried unto the man of<br>God that came from Judah, saying,<br>Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch<br>as thou hast a disobeyed the mouth<br>of the LORD, and hast not kept the<br>commandment which the LORD thy<br>God commanded thee,<br>22 But camest back, and hast eaten<br>bread and drunk water in the place,<br>of the which the LORD did say to<br>thee, Eat no bread, and drink no<br>water; thy carcase shall not come<br>unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.<br>23 ¶ And it came to pass, after he<br>had eaten bread, and after he had<br>drunk, that he saddled for him the<br>ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he<br>had brought back.<br>24 And when he was gone, a lion<br>met him by the way, and slew him:<br>and his carcase was cast in the way,<br>and the ass stood by it, the lion also<br>stood by the carcase.<br>25 And, behold, men passed by,<br>and saw the carcase cast in the way,<br>and the lion standing by the carcase:<br>and they came and told it in the city<br>where the old prophet dwelt.<br>26 And when the prophet that<br>brought him back from the way|Col4|

And they<br>saddled him.<br>28 And he went and found his car-<br>case cast in the way, and the ass and<br>the lion standing by the carcase: the<br>lion had not eaten the carcase, nor<br>torn the ass.<br>29 And the prophet took up the<br>carcase of the man of God, and<br>laid it upon the ass, and brought it<br>back: and the old prophet came to<br>the city, to mourn and to bury him.<br>30 And he laid his carcase in his<br>own a grave; and they mourned over<br>him, saying, Alas, my brother!<br>31 And it came to pass, after he<br>had buried him, that he spake to his<br>sons, saying, When I am dead, then<br>bury me in the sepulchre wherein<br>the man of God is buried; lay my<br>bones beside his bones:<br>32 For the saying which he cried<br>by the word of the LORD against the<br>altar in Beth-el, and against all the<br>houses of the high places which are<br>in the cities of Samaria, shall surely<br>come to pass.<br>33 ¶ After this thing Jeroboam re-<br>turned not from his evil way, but<br>made again of the lowest of the peo-<br>ple priests of the high places: who-<br>soever would, he consecrated him,<br>and he became one of the priests of<br>the high places.<br>34 And this thing became a sin unto<br>the house of Jeroboam, even to cut<br>it off, and to destroy it from off the<br>face of the earth.<br>CHAPTER 14<br>Ahijah foretells the ruin of Jeroboam’s<br>house, the death of his child, and the|Col2|scattering of the Israelites because<br>of their idolatry—Jeroboam dies and<br>Nadab reigns—Judah, under Rehoboam,<br>turns to wickedness—Shishak of Egypt<br>takes treasures from the temple—Reho-<br>boam dies and Abijam reigns.<br>AT that time Abijah the son of Jero-<br>boam fell sick.<br>2 And Jeroboam said to his wife,<br>Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thy-<br>self, that thou be not known to be<br>the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee<br>to Shiloh: behold, there is aA hijah<br>the prophet, which told me that I<br>should be king over this people.<br>3 And take with thee ten loaves,<br>and a cracknels, and a cruse of honey,<br>and go to him: he shall tell thee what<br>shall become of the child.<br>4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and<br>arose, and went to Shiloh, and came<br>to the house of Ahijah.

And when he came to the<br>gate of the city, behold, the widow<br>woman was there gathering of sticks:<br>and he called to her, and said, Fetch<br>me, I pray thee, a little water in a<br>vessel, that I may drink.<br>11 And as she was going to fetch<br>it, he called to her, and said, Bring<br>me, I pray thee, a morsel of a bread<br>in thine hand.<br>12 And she said, As the LORD thy<br>God liveth, I have not a cake, but<br>an handful of meal in a barrel, and<br>a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I<br>am gathering two sticks, that I may<br>go in and dress it for me and my<br>son, that we may eat it, and die.<br>13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear<br>not; go and do as thou hast said:<br>but make me thereof a little cake<br>first, and bring it unto me, and af-<br>ter make for thee and for thy son.<br>14 For thus saith the LORD God of<br>Israel, The barrel of meal shall not|Col2|waste, neither shall the cruse of<br>oil fail, until the day that the LORD<br>sendeth rain upon the earth.<br>15 And she a went and did accord-<br>ing to the saying of Elijah: and<br>she, and he, and her house, did eat<br>many days.<br>16 And the barrel of meal wasted<br>not, neither did the cruse of oil fail,<br>according to the word of the LORD,<br>which he spake by Elijah.<br>17 ¶ And it came to pass after these<br>things, that the son of the woman,<br>the mistress of the house, fell sick;<br>and his a sickness was so sore, that<br>there was no breath left in him.<br>18 And she said unto Elijah, What<br>have I to do with thee, O thou man<br>of God? art thou come unto me to<br>call my a sin to remembrance, and<br>to slay my son?<br>19 And he said unto her, Give me<br>thy son.

And there was a sore<br>famine in Samaria.<br>3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which<br>was the governor of his house. (Now<br>Obadiah a feared the LORD greatly:<br>4 For it was so, when aJ ezebel b cut<br>off the prophets of the LORD, that<br>Obadiah took an hundred prophets,<br>and hid them by fifty in a cave, and<br>fed them with bread and water.)<br>5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go<br>into the land, unto all fountains of<br>water, and unto all brooks: perad-<br>venture we may find grass to save<br>the horses and mules alive, that we<br>lose not all the beasts.<br>6 So they divided the land between<br>them to pass throughout it: Ahab<br>went one way by himself, and Oba-<br>diah went another way by himself.<br>7 ¶ And as Obadiah was in the<br>way, behold, Elijah met him: and he<br>knew him, and fell on his face, and<br>said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?<br>8 And he answered him, I am: go,<br>tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.<br>9 And he said, What have I sinned,<br>that thou wouldest deliver thy<br>servant into the hand of Ahab, to<br>slay me?<br>10 As the LORD thy God liveth,<br>there is no nation or kingdom,<br>whither my lord hath not sent to<br>seek thee: and when they said, He<br>is not there; he took an oath of the|Col2|kingdom and nation, that they<br>found thee not.<br>11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell<br>thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.<br>12 And it shall come to pass, as<br>soon as I am gone from thee, that<br>the Spirit of the LORD shall a carry<br>thee whither I know not; and so<br>when I come and tell Ahab, and<br>he cannot find thee, he shall slay<br>me: but I thy servant fear the LORD<br>from my youth.<br>13 Was it not told my lord what I<br>did when Jezebel a slew the prophets<br>of the LORD, how I hid an hundred<br>men of the LORD’s prophets by fifty<br>in a cave, and fed them with bread<br>and water?<br>14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell<br>thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and<br>he shall slay me.<br>15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of<br>hosts liveth, before whom I stand,<br>I will surely shew myself unto him<br>to day.<br>16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab,<br>and told him: and Ahab went to<br>meet Elijah.<br>17 ¶ And it came to pass, when<br>Ahab saw Elijah, that aA hab said<br>unto him, Art thou he that trou-<br>bleth Israel?<br>18 And he answered, I have not trou-<br>bled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s<br>house, in that ye have a forsaken the<br>commandments of the LORD, and<br>thou hast followed Baalim.<br>19 Now therefore send, and gather<br>to me all Israel unto mount Carmel,<br>and the a prophets of Baal four hun-<br>dred and fifty, and the prophets of<br>the groves four hundred, which eat<br>at Jezebel’s table.<br>20 So Ahab sent unto all the chil-<br>dren of Israel, and gathered the<br>a prophets together unto mount<br>Carmel.<br>21 And Elijah came unto all the<br>people, and said, How long halt ye<br>between a two opinions? if the LORD|Col4|

And the messengers departed,<br>and brought him word again.<br>10 And Ben-hadad sent unto him,<br>and said, The a gods do so unto me,<br>and more also, if the dust of Samaria<br>shall suffice for handfuls for all the<br>people that follow me.<br>11 And the king of Israel answered<br>and said, Tell him, Let not him that<br>girdeth on his a harness b boast him-<br>self as he that putteth it off.<br>12 And it came to pass, when Ben-<br>hadad heard this message, as he was<br>drinking, he and the kings in the<br>a pavilions, that he said unto his<br>servants, Set yourselves in array. And<br>they set themselves in array against<br>the city.<br>13 ¶ And, behold, there came a<br>prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,<br>saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast<br>thou seen all this great multitude?<br>behold, I will deliver it into thine<br>hand this day; and thou shalt know<br>that I am the LORD.<br>14 And Ahab said, By whom?

Then said Ahab, I will<br>send thee away with this covenant.<br>So he made a covenant with him,<br>and sent him away.<br>35 ¶ And a certain man of the<br>a sons of the prophets said unto his<br>neighbour in the word of the LORD,<br>Smite me, I pray thee.

And he laid him down<br>upon his bed, and turned away his<br>face, and would eat no bread.<br>5 ¶ But Jezebel his wife came to him,<br>and said unto him, Why is thy spirit<br>so sad, that thou eatest no bread?<br>6 And he said unto her, Because I<br>spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite,<br>and said unto him, Give me thy<br>vineyard for money; or else, if it<br>please thee, I will give thee another<br>vineyard for it: and he answered,<br>I will not give thee my vineyard.|Col2|7 And Jezebel his wife said unto<br>him, Dost thou now govern the king-<br>dom of Israel? arise, and eat bread,<br>and let thine heart be merry: I will<br>give thee the vineyard of Naboth<br>the Jezreelite.<br>8 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s<br>name, and sealed them with his<br>a seal, and sent the letters unto the<br>elders and to the nobles that were<br>in his city, dwelling with Naboth.<br>9 And she wrote in the letters,<br>saying, Proclaim a a fast, and set<br>Naboth on high among the people:<br>10 And set two men, sons of Be-<br>lial, before him, to bear witness<br>a against him, saying, Thou didst<br>b blaspheme God and the king.

And thou shalt speak unto<br>him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,<br>In the place where dogs licked the<br>blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy<br>blood, even thine.<br>20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast<br>thou found me, O mine enemy ?<br>And he answered, I have found thee:<br>because thou hast sold thyself to<br>work evil in the sight of the LORD.<br>21 Behold, I will bring evil upon<br>thee, and will take away thy a pos-<br>terity, and will cut off from Ahab<br>him that pisseth against the wall,<br>and him that is shut up and left<br>in Israel,<br>22 And will make thine house like<br>the house of Jeroboam the son of<br>Nebat, and like the house of Baasha<br>the son of Ahijah, for the provo-<br>cation wherewith thou hast pro-<br>voked me to anger, and made Israel<br>to sin.<br>23 And of Jezebel also spake the<br>LORD, saying, The a dogs shall eat<br>Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.<br>24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the<br>city the dogs shall eat; and him that<br>dieth in the field shall the fowls of<br>the air eat.<br>25 ¶ But there was none like unto<br>Ahab, which did sell himself to work<br>wickedness in the sight of the LORD,<br>whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.<br>26 And he did very a abominably<br>in following idols, according to all<br>things as did the Amorites, whom<br>the LORD cast out before the chil-<br>dren of Israel.<br>27 And it came to pass, when Ahab<br>heard those words, that he a rent his<br>clothes, and put sackcloth upon his|Col2|flesh, and fasted, and lay in sack-<br>cloth, and went b softly.<br>28 And the word of the LORD came<br>to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,<br>29 Seest thou how Ahab hum-<br>bleth himself before me? because<br>he humbleth himself before me, I<br>will not bring the evil in his days:<br>but in his son’s days will I bring the<br>evil upon his house.<br>CHAPTER 22<br>Jehoshaphat of Judah and Ahab of Israel<br>join forces against Syria—Ahab’s proph-<br>ets foretell success—Micaiah foretells<br>the defeat and death of Ahab—Ahab<br>is slain and dogs lick up his blood—<br>Jehoshaphat reigns in righteousness in<br>Judah—Ahaziah reigns in Israel and<br>serves Baal.<br>AND they continued three years<br>without war between Syria and<br>Israel.<br>2 And it came to pass in the third<br>year, that Jehoshaphat the king of<br>Judah came down to the king of<br>Israel.<br>3 And the king of Israel said unto<br>his servants, Know ye that Ramoth<br>in Gilead is ours, and we be still,<br>and take it not out of the hand of<br>the king of Syria?<br>4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat,<br>Wilt thou go with me to battle to<br>Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat<br>said to the king of Israel, a I am as<br>thou art, my people as thy people,<br>my horses as thy horses.<br>5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the<br>king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee,<br>at the word of the LORD to day.<br>6 Then the king of Israel gathered<br>the a prophets together, about four<br>hundred men, and said unto them,<br>Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to<br>battle, or shall I forbear? And they<br>said, Go up; for the Lord shall de-<br>liver it into the hand of the king.<br>7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not<br>here a prophet of the LORD besides,<br>that we might inquire of him?|Col4|

|8 And the king of Israel said unto<br>Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,<br>Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom<br>we may inquire of the LORD: but I<br>a hate him; for he doth not proph-<br>esy good concerning me, but evil.<br>And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the<br>king say so.<br>9 Then the king of Israel called<br>an officer, and said, Hasten hither<br>Micaiah the son of Imlah.<br>10 And the king of Israel and<br>Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat<br>each on his throne, having put on<br>their robes, in a a void place in the<br>entrance of the gate of Samaria;<br>and all the prophets prophesied<br>before them.<br>11 And Zedekiah the son of Che-<br>naanah made him horns of iron: and<br>he said, Thus saith the LORD, With<br>these shalt thou push the Syrians,<br>until thou have consumed them.<br>12 And all the prophets prophe-<br>sied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-<br>gilead, and prosper: for the LORD<br>shall deliver it into the king’s hand.<br>13 And the messenger that was<br>gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,<br>saying, Behold now, the words of<br>the prophets declare good unto the<br>king with one mouth: let thy word, I<br>pray thee, be like the word of one of<br>them, and speak that which is good.<br>14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD<br>liveth, what the LORD saith unto<br>me, that will I speak.<br>15 ¶ So he came to the king. And<br>the king said unto him, Micaiah,<br>shall we go against Ramoth-gilead<br>to battle, or shall we forbear? And<br>he answered him, Go, and prosper:<br>for the LORD shall deliver it into the<br>hand of the king.<br>16 And the king said unto him, How<br>many times shall I adjure thee that<br>thou tell me nothing but that which<br>is true in the name of the LORD?<br>17 And he said, I saw all Israel<br>a scattered upon the hills, as b sheep<br>that have not a shepherd: and the<br>LORD said, These have no master:|Col2|let them return every man to his<br>house in peace.<br>18 And the king of Israel said unto<br>Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee<br>that he would prophesy no good<br>concerning me, but evil?<br>19 And he said, Hear thou there-<br>fore the word of the LORD: I saw the<br>LORD sitting on his throne, and all<br>the host of heaven standing by him<br>on his right hand and on his left.<br>20 And the LORD said, Who shall<br>persuade Ahab, that he may go up<br>and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one<br>said on this manner, and another<br>said on that manner.<br>21 And there came forth a spirit,<br>and stood before the LORD, and<br>said, I will persuade him.<br>22 And the LORD said unto him,<br>Wherewith? And he said, I will go<br>forth, and I will be a a lying spirit in<br>the mouth of all his prophets. And<br>he said, Thou shalt persuade him,<br>and prevail also: go forth, and do so.<br>23 Now therefore, behold, the<br>LORD hath put a a lying spirit in<br>the mouth of all these thy proph-<br>ets, and the LORD hath spoken evil<br>concerning thee.<br>24 But Zedekiah the son of Che-<br>naanah went near, and smote Mica-<br>iah on the cheek, and said, Which<br>way went the Spirit of the LORD<br>from me to speak unto thee?<br>25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou<br>shalt see in that day, when thou<br>shalt go into an inner chamber to<br>hide thyself.<br>26 And the king of Israel said, Take<br>Micaiah, and carry him back unto<br>Amon the governor of the city, and<br>to Joash the king’s son;<br>27 And say, Thus saith the king,<br>Put this fellow in the prison, and<br>feed him with bread of affliction<br>and with water of affliction, until<br>I come in peace.<br>28 And Micaiah said, If thou return<br>at all in peace, the LORD hath not<br>spoken by me. And he said, Heark en,<br>O people, every one of you.|Col4|

1 KINGS 22:29–50 506












|29 So the king of Israel and Jehosh-<br>aphat the king of Judah went up to<br>Ramoth-gilead.<br>30 And the king of Israel said unto<br>Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,<br>and enter into the battle; but put<br>thou on thy robes. And the king of<br>Israel disguised himself, and went<br>into the battle.<br>31 But the king of Syria commanded<br>his thirty and two captains that had<br>rule over his chariots, saying, Fight<br>neither with small nor great, save<br>only with the king of Israel.<br>32 And it came to pass, when the<br>captains of the chariots saw Jehosh-<br>aphat, that they said, Surely it is<br>the king of Israel. And they turned<br>aside to fight against him: and Jeho-<br>shaphat cried out.<br>33 And it came to pass, when the<br>captains of the chariots perceived<br>that it was not the king of Israel,<br>that they turned back from pur-<br>suing him.<br>34 And a certain man drew a bow<br>at a venture, and smote the king<br>of Israel a between the joints of the<br>harness: wherefore he said unto the<br>driver of his chariot, Turn thine<br>hand, and carry me out of the host;<br>for I am wounded.<br>35 And the battle increased that<br>day: and the king was a stayed up<br>in his chariot against the Syrians,<br>and died at even: and the blood ran<br>out of the wound into the midst of<br>the chariot.<br>36 And there went a proclamation<br>throughout the host about the go-<br>ing down of the sun, saying, Every<br>man to his city, and every man to<br>his own country.<br>37 ¶ So the king a died, and was<br>brought to Samaria; and they bur-<br>ied the king in Samaria.<br>38 And one washed the chariot<br>in the pool of Samaria; and the<br>dogs licked up his blood; and they<br>washed his armour; according unto|Col2|the word of the LORD which he<br>spake.<br>39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab,<br>and all that he did, and the a ivory<br>house which he made, and all the<br>cities that he built, are they not<br>written in the book of the chroni-<br>cles of the kings of Israel?<br>40 So Ahab slept with his fathers;<br>and Ahaziah his son reigned in his<br>stead.<br>41 ¶ And Jehoshaphat the son of<br>Asa began to reign over Judah in the<br>fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.<br>42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five<br>years old when he began to reign;<br>and he reigned twenty and five years<br>in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name<br>was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.<br>43 And he walked in all the ways<br>of Asa his father; he turned not aside<br>from it, doing that which was right<br>in the eyes of the LORD: neverthe-<br>less the high places were not taken<br>away; for the people offered and<br>burnt incense yet in the high places.<br>44 And Jehoshaphat made peace<br>with the king of Israel.<br>45 Now the rest of the acts of Je-<br>hoshaphat, and his might that he<br>shewed, and how he warred, are<br>they not written in the book of the<br>chronicles of the kings of Judah?<br>46 And the remnant of the a sod-<br>omites, which remained in the days<br>of his father Asa, he took out of<br>the land.<br>47 There was then no a king in<br>Edom: a deputy was king.<br>48 Jehoshaphat made ships of<br>Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:<br>but they went not; for the ships<br>were broken at a Ezion-geber.<br>49 Then said Ahaziah the son of<br>Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my ser-<br>vants go with thy servants in the<br>ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.<br>50 ¶ And Jehoshaphat slept with<br>his fathers, and was buried with<br>his fathers in the city of David his|Col4|
