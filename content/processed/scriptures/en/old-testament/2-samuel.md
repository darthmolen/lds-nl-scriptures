1 SAMUEL 31:3–2 SAMUEL 1:4 426



3 And the battle went sore against
Saul, and the archers hit him; and
he was sore wounded of the archers.
4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
me through therewith; lest these
uncircumcised come and thrust me
through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was
sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a
sword, and _**[a ]**_ fell upon it.
5 And when his armourbearer saw
that _**[a ]**_ Saul was dead, he fell likewise
upon his sword, and died with him.
6 So Saul died, and his three sons,
and his armourbearer, and all his
men, that same day together.
7 ¶ And when the men of Israel
that _were_ on the other side of the
valley, and _they_ that _were_ on the
other side Jordan, saw that the men
of Israel fled, and that Saul and his
sons were dead, they forsook the
cities, and fled; and the Philistines
came and dwelt in them.



8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to
strip the slain, that they found Saul
and his three sons fallen in mount
Gilboa.
9 And they cut off his head, and
stripped off his armour, and sent
into the land of the Philistines round
about, to publish _it in_ the house of
their idols, and among the people.
10 And they put his armour in
the house of Ashtaroth: and they
fastened his _**[a ]**_ body to the wall of
Beth-shan.
11 ¶ And when the inhabitants of
_**a**_ Jabesh-gilead heard of that which
the Philistines had done to Saul;
12 All the valiant men arose, and
went all night, and took the body of
Saul and the bodies of his sons from
the wall of Beth-shan, and came to
Jabesh, and burnt them there.
13 And they took their bones, and
buried _them_ under a tree at Jabesh,
and fasted seven days.

And he answered, That the<br>people are fled from the battle, and<br>many of the people also are fallen<br>and dead; and Saul and Jonathan<br>his son are dead also.<br>5 And David said unto the young<br>man that told him, How knowest<br>thou that Saul and Jonathan his<br>son be dead?<br>6 And the young man that told<br>him said, As I happened by chance<br>upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul<br>leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the<br>chariots and horsemen followed<br>hard after him.<br>7 And when he looked behind him,<br>he saw me, and called unto me.

And the LORD said unto<br>him, Go up. And David said, Whither<br>shall I go up? And he said, Unto<br>Hebron.<br>2 So David went up thither, and<br>his two a wives also, Ahinoam the<br>Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal’s<br>wife the Carmelite.<br>3 And his a men that were with him<br>did David bring up, every man with<br>his household: and they dwelt in<br>the cities of Hebron.<br>4 And the men of Judah came,<br>and there they anointed a David<br>king over the house of bJ udah. And<br>they told David, saying, That the<br>men of cJ abesh-gilead were they that<br>buried Saul.<br>5 ¶ And David sent messengers<br>unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, and<br>said unto them, Blessed be ye of<br>the LORD, that ye have shewed this<br>kindness unto your lord, even unto<br>Saul, and have buried him.<br>6 And now the LORD shew kindness<br>and truth unto you: and I also will<br>a requite you this kindness, because<br>ye have done this thing.<br>7 Therefore now let your hands be<br>strengthened, and be ye a valiant: for<br>your master Saul is dead, and also<br>the house of Judah have anointed<br>me king over them.<br>8 ¶ But aA bner the son of Ner,|Col2|captain of Saul’s host, took Ish-<br>bosheth the son of Saul, and brought<br>him over to Mahanaim;<br>9 And made him king over Gilead,<br>and over the Ashurites, and over<br>Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over<br>Benjamin, and over all Israel.<br>10 Ish-bosheth Saul’s son was forty<br>years old when he began to reign over<br>Israel, and reigned two years. But<br>the house of Judah followed David.<br>11 And the time that David was<br>a king in Hebron over the house<br>of b Judah was seven years and six<br>months.<br>12 ¶ And Abner the son of Ner, and<br>the servants of Ish-bosheth the son<br>of Saul, went out from Mahanaim<br>to Gibeon.<br>13 And Joab the son of Zeruiah,<br>and the servants of David, went<br>out, and met together by the pool of<br>Gibeon: and they sat down, the one<br>on the one side of the pool, and the<br>other on the other side of the pool.<br>14 And Abner said to Joab, Let the<br>young men now arise, and play be-<br>fore us.

And he<br>answered, I am.<br>21 And Abner said to him, Turn<br>thee aside to thy right hand or to<br>thy left, and lay thee hold on one<br>of the young men, and take thee<br>his armour. But Asahel would not<br>turn aside from following of him.<br>22 And Abner said again to Asahel,<br>Turn thee aside from following me:<br>wherefore should I smite thee to the<br>ground? how then should I hold up<br>my face to Joab thy brother?<br>23 Howbeit he refused to turn aside:<br>wherefore Abner with the hinder<br>end of the spear smote him under<br>the a fifth rib, that the spear came<br>out behind him; and he fell down<br>there, and died in the same place:<br>and it came to pass, that as many<br>as came to the place where bA sahel<br>fell down and died stood still.<br>24 Joab also and Abishai pursued<br>after Abner: and the sun went down<br>when they were come to the hill of<br>Ammah, that lieth before Giah by<br>the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.<br>25 ¶ And the children of Benjamin<br>gathered themselves together after<br>Abner, and became one troop, and<br>stood on the top of an hill.<br>26 Then Abner called to Joab, and<br>said, Shall the sword devour for<br>ever? knowest thou not that it will<br>be bitterness in the latter end? how<br>long shall it be then, ere thou bid<br>the people return from following<br>their brethren?<br>27 And Joab said, As God liveth,<br>unless thou hadst spoken, surely<br>then in the morning the people had<br>gone up every one from following<br>his brother.<br>28 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all<br>the people stood still, and pursued<br>after Israel no more, neither fought<br>they any more.|Col2|29 And Abner and his men walked<br>all that night through the plain,<br>and passed over Jordan, and went<br>through all Bithron, and they came<br>to Mahanaim.<br>30 And Joab returned from follow-<br>ing Abner: and when he had gath-<br>ered all the people together, there<br>lacked of David’s servants nineteen<br>men and Asahel.<br>31 But the servants of David had<br>smitten of Benjamin, and of Ab-<br>ner’s men, so that three hundred<br>and threescore men died.<br>32 ¶ And they took up Asahel, and<br>buried him in the sepulchre of his<br>father, which was in Beth-lehem.<br>And Joab and his men went all<br>night, and they came to Hebron at<br>break of day.<br>CHAPTER 3<br>The houses of David and Saul engage<br>in a long war—David grows stron-<br>ger—Abner joins David but is slain by<br>Joab—David mourns for Abner.<br>NOW there was long war be-<br>tween the house of Saul and the<br>house of David: but David waxed<br>stronger and stronger, and the<br>house of Saul waxed weaker and<br>weaker.<br>2 ¶ And unto a David were sons<br>born in Hebron: and his firstborn<br>was Amnon, of bA hinoam the Jez-<br>reelitess;<br>3 And his second, Chileab, of Abi-<br>gail the wife of Nabal the Carmel-<br>ite; and the third, aA bsalom the son<br>of Maacah the daughter of Talmai<br>king of b Geshur;<br>4 And the fourth, aA donijah the son<br>of Haggith; and the fifth, Shepha-<br>tiah the son of Abital;<br>5 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eg-<br>lah David’s wife.

And king David himself<br>followed the bier.<br>32 And they buried Abner in He-<br>bron: and the king lifted up his<br>voice, and wept at the grave of<br>Abner; and all the people wept.<br>33 And the king lamented over<br>Abner, and said, Died Abner as a<br>fool dieth?<br>34 Thy hands were not bound, nor<br>thy feet put into fetters: as a man<br>falleth before wicked men, so fellest<br>thou. And all the people wept again<br>over him.<br>35 And when all the people came<br>to cause David to eat meat while it<br>was yet day, David sware, saying,<br>So do God to me, and more also, if<br>I taste bread, or ought else, till the<br>sun be down.<br>36 And all the people took notice<br>of it, and it pleased them: as what-<br>soever the king did pleased all the<br>people.|Col2|37 For all the people and all Israel<br>understood that day that it was not<br>of the king to slay Abner the son<br>of Ner.<br>38 And the king said unto his ser-<br>vants, Know ye not that there is a<br>prince and a great man fallen this<br>day in Israel?<br>39 And I am this day weak, though<br>anointed king; and these men the<br>sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me:<br>the LORD shall a reward the doer of<br>evil according to his wickedness.<br>CHAPTER 4<br>Two of Saul’s captains slay Ishbosh-<br>eth—They take his head to David, who<br>has them slain for killing a righteous<br>person.<br>AND when Saul’s son heard that Ab-<br>ner was dead in Hebron, his hands<br>were feeble, and all the Israelites<br>were troubled.<br>2 And Saul’s son had two men that<br>were captains of bands: the name of<br>the one was Baanah, and the name<br>of the other Rechab, the sons of<br>Rimmon a Beerothite, of the chil-<br>dren of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also<br>was reckoned to Benjamin:<br>3 And the Beerothites fled to Git-<br>taim, and were a sojourners there<br>until this day.)<br>4 And a Jonathan, Saul’s son, had<br>a son that was lame of his feet.

|11 ¶ And a Hiram king of Tyre sent<br>messengers to David, and cedar<br>trees, and carpenters, and masons:<br>and they built David an house.<br>12 And David perceived that the<br>LORD had established him king over<br>Israel, and that he had exalted his<br>kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.<br>13 ¶ And David took him more<br>concubines and a wives out of Je-<br>rusalem, after he was come from<br>Hebron: and there were yet b sons<br>and daughters born to David.<br>14 And these be the names of those<br>that were born unto him in Jeru-<br>salem; Shammua, and Shobab, and<br>Nathan, and Solomon,<br>15 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and<br>Nepheg, and Japhia,<br>16 And Elishama, and Eliada, and<br>Eliphalet.<br>17 ¶ But when the Philistines<br>heard that they had anointed Da-<br>vid king over Israel, all the Philis-<br>tines came up to seek David; and<br>David heard of it, and went down<br>to the a hold.<br>18 The Philistines also came and<br>spread themselves in the valley of<br>Rephaim.<br>19 And David inquired of the<br>LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the<br>Philistines? wilt thou deliver them<br>into mine hand? And the LORD<br>said unto David, Go up: for I will<br>doubtless deliver the Philistines<br>into thine hand.<br>20 And David came to a Baal-<br>perazim, and David smote them<br>there, and said, The LORD hath<br>broken forth upon mine enemies<br>before me, as the b breach of wa-<br>ters. Therefore he called the name<br>of that place Baal-perazim.<br>21 And there they left their a im-<br>ages, and David and his men b burned<br>them.<br>22 ¶ And the a Philistines came up|Col2|yet again, and spread themselves in<br>the valley of Rephaim.<br>23 And when David inquired of<br>the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not<br>go up; but fetch a compass behind<br>them, and come upon them over<br>against the mulberry trees.<br>24 And let it be, when thou hear-<br>est the sound of a going in the tops<br>of the mulberry trees, that then<br>thou shalt bestir thyself: for then<br>shall the LORD go out before thee,<br>to smite the host of the Philistines.<br>25 And David did so, as the LORD<br>had commanded him; and smote<br>the a Philistines from Geba until<br>thou come to Gazer.<br>CHAPTER 6<br>David takes the ark to the city of Da-<br>vid—Uzzah is smitten for steadying the<br>ark and dies—David dances before the<br>Lord, causing a breach between him<br>and Michal.<br>AGAIN, David a gathered together<br>all the chosen men of Israel, thirty<br>thousand.<br>2 And David arose, and went with<br>all the people that were with him<br>from Baale of Judah, to bring up<br>from thence the a ark of God, whose<br>name is called by the name of the<br>LORD of hosts that dwelleth between<br>the b cherubims.<br>3 And they set the ark of God upon<br>a new cart, and brought it out of<br>the house of Abinadab that was in<br>Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the<br>sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.<br>4 And they brought it out of the<br>house of Abinadab which was at<br>Gibeah, accompanying the ark of<br>God: and Ahio went before the ark.<br>5 And David and all the house of<br>Israel played before the LORD on<br>all manner of instruments made of<br>fir wood, even on a harps, and on|Col4|

So David went and<br>brought up the ark of God from the<br>house of Obed-edom into the city<br>of David with gladness.<br>13 And it was so, that when they<br>that bare the ark of the LORD had<br>gone six paces, he a sacrificed oxen<br>and fatlings.<br>14 And David a danced before the<br>LORD with all his might; and David<br>was girded with a linen ephod.<br>15 So David and all the house of<br>Israel brought up the ark of the<br>LORD with shouting, and with the<br>sound of the trumpet.<br>16 And as the ark of the LORD came|Col2|into the city of David, Michal Saul’s<br>daughter looked through a window,<br>and saw king David leaping and<br>dancing before the LORD; and she<br>despised him in her heart.<br>17 ¶ And they brought in the a ark<br>of the LORD, and set it in his place,<br>in the midst of the tabernacle that<br>David had pitched for it: and David<br>offered burnt offerings and peace<br>offerings before the LORD.<br>18 And as soon as David had made<br>an end of offering burnt offerings<br>and peace offerings, he a blessed<br>the people in the name of the LORD<br>of hosts.<br>19 And he dealt among all the peo-<br>ple, even among the whole multitude<br>of Israel, as well to the women as<br>men, to every one a cake of bread,<br>and a good piece of flesh, and a a<br>flagon of wine.

|Saul thy father; and thou shalt a eat<br>bread at my table continually.<br>8 And he bowed himself, and<br>said, What is thy servant, that thou<br>shouldest look upon such a a dead<br>dog as I am?<br>9 ¶ Then the king called to Ziba,<br>Saul’s servant, and said unto him,<br>I have given unto thy master’s son<br>all that pertained to Saul and to<br>all his house.<br>10 Thou therefore, and thy sons,<br>and thy servants, shall till the land<br>for him, and thou shalt bring in the<br>fruits, that thy master’s son may have<br>food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy<br>master’s son shall eat bread alway<br>at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen<br>sons and twenty servants.<br>11 Then said Ziba unto the king,<br>According to all that my lord the<br>king hath commanded his servant,<br>so shall thy servant do. As for Me-<br>phibosheth, said the king, he shall<br>eat at my table, as one of the king’s<br>sons.<br>12 And Mephibosheth had a young<br>son, whose name was Micha. And<br>all that dwelt in the house of Ziba<br>were a servants unto Mephibosheth.<br>13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Je-<br>rusalem: for he did eat continually<br>at the king’s table; and was lame on<br>both his feet.<br>CHAPTER 10<br>David’s messengers are abused by the<br>Ammonites—Israel defeats the Ammon-<br>ites and Syrians.<br>AND it came to pass after this, that<br>the king of the children of aA mmon<br>died, and Hanun his son reigned<br>in his stead.<br>2 Then said David, I will shew<br>kindness unto Hanun the son of<br>Nahash, as his father shewed kind-<br>ness unto me.

|2 The rich man had exceeding<br>many flocks and herds:<br>3 But the poor man had nothing,<br>save one little ewe lamb, which he<br>had bought and nourished up: and<br>it grew up together with him, and<br>with his children; it did eat of his<br>own meat, and drank of his own<br>cup, and lay in his bosom, and was<br>unto him as a daughter.<br>4 And there came a traveller unto<br>the rich man, and he spared to take<br>of his own flock and of his own<br>herd, to dress for the wayfaring man<br>that was come unto him; but took<br>the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it<br>for the man that was come to him.<br>5 And David’s anger was greatly<br>kindled against the man; and he<br>said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth,<br>the man that hath done this thing<br>shall surely die:<br>6 And he shall restore the lamb<br>a fourfold, because he did this thing,<br>and because he had no pity.<br>7 ¶ And Nathan said to David,<br>Thou art the man.

So<br>David and all the people returned<br>unto Jerusalem.<br>CHAPTER 13<br>Amnon desires Tamar, his sister,<br>and forces her—He is slain by Ab-<br>salom’s command—Absalom flees to<br>Geshur.<br>AND it came to pass after this, that<br>aA bsalom the son of David had a fair<br>sister, whose name was b Tamar; and<br>Amnon the son of David loved her.<br>2 And Amnon was so vexed, that<br>he fell sick for his sister Tamar;<br>for she was a virgin; and Amnon<br>thought it hard for him to do any<br>thing to her.<br>3 But Amnon had a friend, whose<br>name was a Jonadab, the son of<br>Shimeah David’s brother: and Jona-<br>dab was a very subtil man.<br>4 And he said unto him, Why<br>art thou, being the king’s son, lean<br>from day to day ? wilt thou not tell<br>me? And Amnon said unto him, I<br>love a Tamar, my brother Absalom’s<br>sister.<br>5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay<br>thee down on thy bed, and make<br>thyself sick: and when thy father<br>cometh to see thee, say unto him, I<br>pray thee, let my sister Tamar come,<br>and give me meat, and dress the<br>meat in my sight, that I may see it,<br>and eat it at her hand.<br>6 ¶ So Amnon lay down, and made|Col4|

|himself sick: and when the king was<br>come to see him, Amnon said unto<br>the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my<br>sister come, and make me a couple<br>of cakes in my sight, that I may eat<br>at her hand.<br>7 Then David sent home to Tamar,<br>saying, Go now to thy brother Am-<br>non’s house, and dress him meat.<br>8 So Tamar went to her brother<br>Amnon’s house; and he was laid<br>down. And she took flour, and<br>kneaded it, and made cakes in his<br>sight, and did bake the cakes.<br>9 And she took a pan, and poured<br>them out before him; but he refused<br>to eat. And Amnon said, Have out<br>all men from me. And they went<br>out every man from him.<br>10 And Amnon said unto Tamar,<br>Bring the meat into the chamber,<br>that I may eat of thine hand. And<br>Tamar took the cakes which she<br>had made, and brought them into<br>the chamber to Amnon her brother.<br>11 And when she had brought<br>them unto him to eat, he a took hold<br>of her, and said unto her, Come lie<br>with me, my sister.<br>12 And she answered him, Nay,<br>my brother, do not a force me; for<br>no such thing ought to be done in<br>Israel: do not thou this b folly.<br>13 And I, whither shall I cause<br>my a shame to go? and as for thee,<br>thou shalt be as one of the fools in<br>Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee,<br>speak unto the king; for he will not<br>withhold me from thee.<br>14 Howbeit he would not hearken<br>unto her voice: but, being stronger<br>than she, forced her, and lay with her.<br>15 ¶ Then Amnon hated her ex-<br>ceedingly; so that the hatred where-<br>with he hated her was greater than<br>the love wherewith he had loved<br>her. And Amnon said unto her,<br>Arise, be gone.<br>16 And she said unto him, There<br>is no cause: this evil in sending me<br>away is greater than the other that<br>thou didst unto me. But he would<br>not hearken unto her.|Col2|17 Then he called his servant that<br>ministered unto him, and said, Put<br>now this woman out from me, and<br>bolt the door after her.<br>18 And she had a garment of di-<br>vers colours upon her: for with such<br>robes were the king’s daughters that<br>were virgins apparelled. Then his<br>servant brought her out, and bolted<br>the door after her.<br>19 ¶ And Tamar put ashes on her<br>head, and rent her garment of di-<br>vers colours that was on her, and<br>laid her hand on her head, and<br>went on crying.<br>20 And Absalom her brother said<br>unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother<br>been with thee? but hold now thy<br>peace, my sister: he is thy brother;<br>regard not this thing. So Tamar<br>remained desolate in her brother<br>Absalom’s house.<br>21 ¶ But when king David heard of<br>all these things, he was very wroth.<br>22 And Absalom spake unto his<br>brother Amnon neither good nor<br>bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, be-<br>cause he had forced his sister Tamar.<br>23 ¶ And it came to pass after two<br>full years, that Absalom had sheep-<br>shearers in Baal-hazor, which is be-<br>side Ephraim: and Absalom invited<br>all the king’s sons.<br>24 And Absalom came to the king,<br>and said, Behold now, thy servant<br>hath sheepshearers; let the king, I<br>beseech thee, and his servants go<br>with thy servant.<br>25 And the king said to Absalom,<br>Nay, my son, let us not all now go,<br>lest we be chargeable unto thee. And<br>he pressed him: howbeit he would<br>not go, but blessed him.<br>26 Then said Absalom, If not, I<br>pray thee, let my brother Amnon<br>go with us. And the king said unto<br>him, Why should he go with thee?<br>27 But Absalom pressed him, that<br>he let Amnon and all the king’s sons<br>go with him.<br>28 ¶ Now Absalom had com-<br>manded his servants, saying, Mark<br>ye now when Amnon’s heart is|Col4|

Then all the king’s<br>sons arose, and every man gat him<br>up upon his mule, and fled.<br>30 ¶ And it came to pass, while<br>they were in the way, that tidings<br>came to David, saying, Absalom<br>hath slain all the king’s sons, and<br>there is not one of them left.<br>31 Then the king arose, and tare<br>his garments, and lay on the earth;<br>and all his servants stood by with<br>their clothes rent.<br>32 And a Jonadab, the son of<br>Shimeah David’s brother, answered<br>and said, Let not my lord suppose<br>that they have slain all the young<br>men the king’s sons; for Amnon<br>only is dead: for by the appoint-<br>ment of Absalom this hath been<br>determined from the day that he<br>forced his sister Tamar.<br>33 Now therefore let not my lord<br>the king take the thing to his heart,<br>to think that all the king’s sons are<br>dead: for Amnon only is dead.<br>34 But Absalom fled. And the<br>young man that kept the watch<br>lifted up his eyes, and looked, and,<br>behold, there came much people<br>by the way of the hill side behind<br>him.<br>35 And Jonadab said unto the king,<br>Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy<br>servant said, so it is.<br>36 And it came to pass, as soon as<br>he had made an end of speaking,<br>that, behold, the king’s sons came,<br>and lifted up their voice and wept:<br>and the king also and all his ser-<br>vants wept very sore.<br>37 ¶ But Absalom fled, and went to<br>Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king<br>of a Geshur. And David mourned<br>for his son every day.<br>38 So Absalom fled, and went to<br>Geshur, and was there three years.<br>39 And the soul of king David|Col2|longed to go forth unto Absalom:<br>for he was comforted concerning<br>Amnon, seeing he was dead.<br>CHAPTER 14<br>Joab arranges by artifice to bring Absa-<br>lom home after three years—After two<br>more years, Absalom sees the king, and<br>they are reconciled.<br>NOW Joab the son of Zeruiah per-<br>ceived that the king’s heart was to-<br>ward Absalom.<br>2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and<br>fetched thence a wise woman, and<br>said unto her, I pray thee, feign<br>thyself to be a mourner, and put<br>on now mourning apparel, and<br>anoint not thyself with oil, but be<br>as a woman that had a long time<br>mourned for the dead:<br>3 And come to the king, and speak<br>on this manner unto him. So Joab<br>put the words in her mouth.<br>4 ¶ And when the woman of<br>Tekoah spake to the king, she fell<br>on her face to the ground, and did<br>obeisance, and said, Help, O king.<br>5 And the king said unto her, What<br>aileth thee? And she answered, I am<br>indeed a widow woman, and mine<br>husband is dead.<br>6 And thy handmaid had two sons,<br>and they two strove together in the<br>field, and there was none to part<br>them, but the one smote the other,<br>and slew him.<br>7 And, behold, the whole family is<br>risen against thine handmaid, and<br>they said, Deliver him that smote<br>his brother, that we may kill him,<br>for the life of his brother whom he<br>slew; and we will destroy the heir<br>also: and so they shall quench my<br>coal which is left, and shall not<br>leave to my husband neither name<br>nor remainder upon the earth.<br>8 And the king said unto the<br>woman, Go to thine house, and I<br>will give charge concerning thee.<br>9 And the woman of Tekoah said<br>unto the king, My lord, O king, the<br>iniquity be on me, and on my father’s|Col4|

And<br>he said, Say on.<br>13 And the woman said, Where-<br>fore then hast thou thought such<br>a thing against the people of God?<br>for the king doth speak this thing<br>as one which is faulty, in that the<br>king doth not fetch home again his<br>banished.<br>14 For we must needs die, and are<br>as water spilt on the ground, which<br>cannot be gathered up again; nei-<br>ther doth God respect any person:<br>yet doth he devise means, that his<br>banished be not a expelled from<br>him.<br>15 Now therefore that I am come to<br>speak of this thing unto my lord the<br>king, it is because the people have<br>made me afraid: and thy handmaid<br>said, I will now speak unto the king;<br>it may be that the king will perform<br>the request of his handmaid.<br>16 For the king will hear, to de-<br>liver his handmaid out of the hand<br>of the man that would destroy me<br>and my son together out of the in-<br>heritance of God.<br>17 Then thine handmaid said, The<br>word of my lord the king shall now<br>be comfortable: for as an angel of<br>God, so is my lord the king to dis-<br>cern good and bad: therefore the<br>LORD thy God will be with thee.<br>18 Then the king answered and<br>said unto the woman, Hide not from<br>me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall|Col2|ask thee. And the woman said, Let<br>my lord the king now speak.<br>19 And the king said, Is not the<br>hand of Joab with thee in all this?<br>And the woman answered and said,<br>As thy soul liveth, my lord the king,<br>none can turn to the right hand<br>or to the left from ought that my<br>lord the king hath spoken: for thy<br>servant Joab, he bade me, and he<br>put all these words in the mouth<br>of thine handmaid:<br>20 To fetch about this form of<br>speech hath thy servant Joab done<br>this thing: and my lord is wise, ac-<br>cording to the wisdom of an angel<br>of God, to know all things that are<br>in the earth.<br>21 ¶ And the king said unto Joab,<br>Behold now, I have done this thing:<br>go therefore, bring the young man<br>Absalom again.<br>22 And Joab fell to the ground on<br>his face, and bowed himself, and<br>a thanked the king: and Joab said,<br>To day thy servant knoweth that I<br>have found grace in thy sight, my<br>lord, O king, in that the king hath<br>fulfilled the request of his servant.<br>23 So Joab arose and went to<br>Geshur, and brought Absalom to<br>Jerusalem.<br>24 And the king said, Let him turn<br>to his own house, and let him not see<br>my face. So Absalom returned to his<br>own house, and saw not the king’s face.<br>25 ¶ But in all Israel there was<br>none to be so much praised as Ab-<br>salom for his beauty: from the sole<br>of his foot even to the crown of his<br>head there was no blemish in him.<br>26 And when he polled his head,<br>(for it was at every year’s end that<br>he polled it: because the hair was<br>heavy on him, therefore he polled<br>it:) he weighed the hair of his head<br>at two hundred shekels after the<br>king’s weight.<br>27 And unto Absalom there were<br>born three a sons, and one daughter,<br>whose name was Tamar: she was a<br>woman of a fair countenance.<br>28 ¶ So Absalom dwelt two full|Col4|

And Absalom’s servants<br>set the field on fire.<br>31 Then Joab arose, and came to<br>Absalom unto his house, and said<br>unto him, Wherefore have thy ser-<br>vants set my field on fire?<br>32 And Absalom answered Joab,<br>Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,<br>Come hither, that I may send thee<br>to the king, to say, Wherefore am<br>I come from a Geshur? it had been<br>good for me to have been there still:<br>now therefore let me see the king’s<br>face; and if there be any iniquity<br>in me, let him kill me.<br>33 So Joab came to the king, and<br>told him: and when he had called<br>for Absalom, he came to the king,<br>and bowed himself on his face to<br>the ground before the king: and the<br>king kissed Absalom.<br>CHAPTER 15<br>Absalom conspires against David and<br>gains the support of the people—David<br>flees, and Absalom enters Jerusalem.<br>AND it came to pass after this, that<br>Absalom prepared him chariots<br>and horses, and fifty men to run<br>before him.<br>2 And aA bsalom rose up early, and<br>stood beside the way of the gate:<br>and it was so, that when any man<br>that had a controversy came to the<br>king for judgment, then Absalom<br>called unto him, and said, Of what<br>city art thou? And he said, Thy ser-<br>vant is of one of the tribes of Israel.<br>3 And Absalom said unto him, See,<br>thy matters are good and right; but|Col2|there is no man deputed of the king<br>to hear thee.<br>4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that<br>I were made judge in the land, that<br>every man which hath any suit or<br>cause might come unto me, and I<br>would do him justice!<br>5 And it was so, that when any<br>man came nigh to him to do him<br>obeisance, he put forth his hand,<br>and took him, and kissed him.<br>6 And on this manner did Absalom<br>to all Israel that came to the king<br>for judgment: so aA bsalom stole the<br>hearts of the men of Israel.<br>7 ¶ And it came to pass after forty<br>years, that Absalom said unto the<br>king, I pray thee, let me go and pay<br>my vow, which I have vowed unto<br>the LORD, in Hebron.<br>8 For thy servant vowed a vow<br>while I abode at a Geshur in Syria,<br>saying, If the LORD shall bring me<br>again indeed to Jerusalem, then I<br>will serve the LORD.<br>9 And the king said unto him, Go<br>in peace. So he arose, and went to<br>Hebron.<br>10 ¶ But Absalom sent spies<br>throughout all the tribes of Israel,<br>saying, As soon as ye hear the sound<br>of the trumpet, then ye shall say,<br>Absalom reigneth in Hebron.<br>11 And with Absalom went two<br>hundred men out of Jerusalem,<br>that were called; and they went in<br>their simplicity, and they knew not<br>any thing.<br>12 And Absalom sent for aA hitho-<br>phel the Gilonite, David’s b counsel-<br>lor, from his city, even from c Giloh,<br>while he offered sacrifices. And<br>the d conspiracy was strong; for the<br>people increased continually with<br>Absalom.<br>13 ¶ And there came a messenger<br>to David, saying, The hearts of the<br>men of Israel are after Absalom.<br>14 And David said unto all his ser-<br>vants that were with him at Jerusa-<br>lem, Arise, and let us a flee; for we|Col4|

And<br>the king left ten women, which were<br>a concubines, to keep the house.<br>17 And the king went forth, and<br>all the people after him, and tarried<br>in a place that was far off.<br>18 And all his servants passed on<br>beside him; and all the Cherethites,<br>and all the Pelethites, and all the<br>Gittites, six hundred men which<br>came after him from Gath, passed<br>on before the king.<br>19 ¶ Then said the king to Ittai the<br>Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also<br>with us? return to thy place, and<br>abide with the king: for thou art a<br>stranger, and also an exile.<br>20 Whereas thou camest but yes-<br>terday, should I this day make thee<br>go up and down with us? seeing I<br>go whither I may, return thou, and<br>take back thy brethren: mercy and<br>truth be with thee.<br>21 And Ittai answered the king,<br>and said, As the LORD liveth, and<br>as my lord the king liveth, surely in<br>what place my lord the king shall<br>be, whether in death or life, even<br>there also will thy servant be.<br>22 And David said to Ittai, Go<br>and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite<br>passed over, and all his men, and all<br>the little ones that were with him.<br>23 And all the country wept with<br>a loud voice, and all the people<br>passed over: the king also himself<br>passed over the brook Kidron, and<br>all the people passed over, toward<br>the way of the wilderness.<br>24 ¶ And lo a Zadok also, and all<br>the Levites were with him, bearing<br>the ark of the covenant of God:|Col2|and they set down the ark of God;<br>and bA biathar went up, until all<br>the people had done passing out of<br>the city.<br>25 And the king said unto Zadok,<br>Carry back the ark of God into the<br>city: if I shall find favour in the<br>eyes of the LORD, he will bring me<br>again, and shew me both it, and his<br>habitation:<br>26 But if he thus say, I have no<br>delight in thee; behold, here am I,<br>let him do to me as seemeth good<br>unto him.<br>27 The king said also unto Zadok<br>the priest, Art not thou a a seer? re-<br>turn into the city in peace, and<br>your two sons with you, Ahimaaz<br>thy son, and bJ onathan the son of<br>Abiathar.<br>28 See, I will tarry in the plain of<br>the wilderness, until there come<br>word from you to certify me.<br>29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar<br>carried the ark of God again to Je-<br>rusalem: and they tarried there.<br>30 ¶ And David went up by the<br>ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as<br>he went up, and had his a head cov-<br>ered, and he went barefoot: and all<br>the people that was with him cov-<br>ered every man his head, and they<br>went up, weeping as they went up.<br>31 ¶ And one told David, saying,<br>Ahithophel is among the conspira-<br>tors with Absalom.

And Ziba said, I<br>humbly beseech thee that I may find<br>grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.|Col2|5 ¶ And when king David came to<br>Bahurim, behold, thence came out<br>a man of the family of the house<br>of Saul, whose name was a Shimei,<br>the son of Gera: he came forth, and<br>b cursed still as he came.<br>6 And he cast stones at David,<br>and at all the servants of king Da-<br>vid: and all the people and all the<br>mighty men were on his right hand<br>and on his left.<br>7 And thus said Shimei when he<br>cursed, Come out, come out, thou<br>bloody man, and thou a man of<br>Belial:<br>8 The LORD hath returned upon<br>thee all the blood of the house<br>of Saul, in whose stead thou hast<br>reigned; and the LORD hath deliv-<br>ered the kingdom into the hand of<br>Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou<br>art taken in thy mischief, because<br>thou art a bloody man.<br>9 ¶ Then said Abishai the son of<br>Zeruiah unto the king, Why should<br>this a dead dog curse my lord the<br>king? let me go over, I pray thee,<br>and take off his head.<br>10 And the king said, What have I<br>to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?<br>so let him curse, because the LORD<br>hath said unto him, Curse David.<br>Who shall then say, Wherefore hast<br>thou done so?<br>11 And David said to Abishai, and<br>to all his servants, Behold, my son,<br>which came forth of my bowels,<br>seeketh my life: how much more<br>now may this Benjamite do it? let<br>him alone, and let him curse; for<br>the LORD hath bidden him.<br>12 It may be that the LORD will<br>look on mine affliction, and that<br>the LORD will a requite me good for<br>his cursing this day.<br>13 And as David and his men went<br>by the way, Shimei went along on<br>the hill’s side over against him, and<br>cursed as he went, and threw stones<br>at him, and cast dust.<br>14 And the king, and all the people|Col4|

For the LORD<br>had a appointed to defeat the good<br>b counsel of Ahithophel, to the in-<br>tent that the LORD might bring evil<br>upon Absalom.<br>15 ¶ Then said Hushai unto Zadok<br>and to Abiathar the priests, Thus<br>and thus did Ahithophel counsel<br>Absalom and the a elders of Israel;<br>and thus and thus have I counselled.<br>16 Now therefore send quickly,<br>and tell David, saying, Lodge not<br>this night in the plains of the wil-<br>derness, but speedily pass over; lest<br>the king be swallowed up, and all<br>the people that are with him.<br>17 Now a Jonathan and Ahimaaz<br>stayed by En-rogel; for they might<br>not be seen to come into the city:<br>and a wench went and told them;<br>and they went and told king David.<br>18 Nevertheless a lad saw them,<br>and told Absalom: but they went<br>both of them away quickly, and<br>came to a man’s house in Bahurim,<br>which had a well in his court;<br>whither they went down.<br>19 And the woman took and spread<br>a covering over the well’s mouth,<br>and spread ground corn thereon;<br>and the thing was not known.<br>20 And when Absalom’s servants<br>came to the woman to the house,<br>they said, Where is Ahimaaz and<br>Jonathan? And the woman said<br>unto them, They be gone over the<br>brook of water. And when they had|Col2|sought and could not find them, they<br>returned to Jerusalem.<br>21 And it came to pass, after they<br>were departed, that they came up<br>out of the well, and went and told<br>king David, and said unto David,<br>Arise, and pass quickly over the<br>water: for thus hath Ahithophel<br>counselled against you.<br>22 Then David arose, and all the<br>people that were with him, and they<br>passed over Jordan: by the morning<br>light there lacked not one of them<br>that was not gone over Jordan.<br>23 ¶ And when Ahithophel saw<br>that his counsel was not followed,<br>he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat<br>him home to his house, to his a city,<br>and put his household in order, and<br>hanged himself, and died, and was<br>buried in the sepulchre of his father.<br>24 Then David came to Mahanaim.<br>And Absalom passed over Jordan, he<br>and all the men of Israel with him.<br>25 ¶ And Absalom made aA masa<br>captain of the host instead of bJ oab:<br>which Amasa was a man’s son, whose<br>name was Ithra an Israelite, that<br>went in to Abigail the daughter<br>of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s<br>mother.<br>26 So Israel and Absalom pitched<br>in the land of Gilead.<br>27 ¶ And it came to pass, when<br>David was a come to Mahanaim, that<br>Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah<br>of the children of Ammon, and<br>Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-<br>debar, and b Barzillai the Gileadite<br>of Rogelim,<br>28 Brought beds, and basins, and<br>earthen vessels, and wheat, and<br>barley, and flour, and parched corn,<br>and beans, and lentiles, and parched<br>pulse,<br>29 And a honey, and butter, and<br>sheep, and cheese of b kine, for Da-<br>vid, and for the people that were<br>with him, to eat: for they said, The<br>people is hungry, and weary, and<br>thirsty, in the wilderness.|Col4|

|CHAPTER 18<br>The Israelites are smitten in the woods<br>of Ephraim—Joab slays Absalom—Tid-<br>ings of his death are taken to David,<br>who mourns for his son.<br>AND David numbered the people<br>that were with him, and set cap-<br>tains of thousands and captains of<br>hundreds over them.<br>2 And David sent forth a third<br>part of the people under the hand<br>of Joab, and a third part under the<br>hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,<br>Joab’s brother, and a third part<br>under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.<br>And the king said unto the peo-<br>ple, I will surely go forth with you<br>myself also.<br>3 But the people answered, Thou<br>shalt not a go forth: for if we flee away,<br>they will not care for us; neither if<br>half of us die, will they care for us:<br>but now thou art worth ten thousand<br>of us: therefore now it is better that<br>thou b succour us out of the city.<br>4 And the king said unto them,<br>What seemeth you best I will do.<br>And the king stood by the gate side,<br>and all the people came out by hun-<br>dreds and by thousands.<br>5 And the king commanded a Joab<br>and Abishai and Ittai, saying, b Deal<br>gently for my sake with the young<br>man, even with Absalom. And all the<br>people heard when the king gave<br>all the captains charge concerning<br>Absalom.<br>6 ¶ So the people went out into the<br>field against Israel: and the battle<br>was in the a wood of Ephraim;<br>7 Where the people of Israel were<br>slain before the servants of David,<br>and there was there a great slaughter<br>that day of twenty thousand men.<br>8 For the battle was there scattered<br>over the face of all the country: and<br>the wood devoured more people<br>that day than the sword devoured.<br>9 ¶ And Absalom met the servants<br>of David. And Absalom rode upon a<br>mule, and the mule went under the|Col2|thick boughs of a great oak, and his<br>head caught hold of the oak, and he<br>was taken up between the heaven<br>and the earth; and the mule that<br>was under him went away.<br>10 And a certain man saw it, and<br>told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw<br>Absalom hanged in an oak.<br>11 And Joab said unto the man<br>that told him, And, behold, thou<br>sawest him, and why didst thou not<br>smite him there to the ground? and<br>I would have given thee ten shekels<br>of silver, and a girdle.<br>12 And the man said unto Joab,<br>Though I should receive a thousand<br>shekels of silver in mine hand, yet<br>would I not put forth mine hand<br>against the king’s son: for in our<br>hearing the king a charged thee and<br>Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware<br>that none touch the young man<br>Absalom.<br>13 Otherwise I should have<br>wrought falsehood against mine<br>own life: for there is no matter hid<br>from the king, and thou thyself<br>wouldest have set thyself against me.<br>14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry<br>thus with thee. And he took three<br>darts in his hand, and thrust them<br>through the heart of Absalom,<br>while he was yet alive in the midst<br>of the oak.<br>15 And ten young men that bare<br>Joab’s armour compassed about<br>and smote Absalom, and slew him.<br>16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and<br>the people returned from pursuing<br>after Israel: for Joab held back the<br>people.<br>17 And they took Absalom, and<br>cast him into a great pit in the<br>wood, and laid a very great heap<br>of stones upon him: and all Israel<br>fled every one to his tent.<br>18 ¶ Now Absalom in his lifetime<br>had taken and reared up for himself<br>a pillar, which is in the a king’s dale:<br>for he said, I have no b son to keep my<br>name in remembrance: and he called<br>the pillar after his own name: and it|Col4|

is called unto this day, Absalom’s
_**c**_ place.
19 ¶ Then said Ahimaaz the son
of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
the king tidings, how that the LORD
hath avenged him of his enemies.
20 And Joab said unto him, Thou
shalt not bear tidings this day, but
thou shalt bear tidings another day:
but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.
21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell
the king what thou hast seen. And
Cushi bowed himself unto Joab,
and ran.
22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of
Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run
after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing
that thou hast no tidings ready ?
23 But howsoever, _said he,_ let me
run. And he said unto him, Run.
Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of
the plain, and overran Cushi.
24 And David sat between the two
gates: and the watchman went up to
the roof over the gate unto the wall,
and lifted up his eyes, and looked,
and behold a man running alone.
25 And the watchman cried, and
told the king. And the king said, If
he _be_ alone, _there is_ tidings in his
mouth. And he came apace, and
drew near.
26 And the watchman saw another
man running: and the watchman
called unto the porter, and said,
Behold _another_ man running alone.
And the king said, He also bringeth
tidings.
27 And the watchman said, Me
thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz
the son of Zadok. And the king said,
He _is_ a good man, and cometh with
good tidings.
28 And Ahimaaz called, and said
unto the king, All is well. And he
fell down to the earth upon his face
before the king, and said, Blessed
_be_ the LORD thy God, which hath
delivered up the men that lifted up
their hand against my lord the king.


18 _c_ OR monument.



29 And the king said, _Is_ the young
man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
answered, When Joab sent the king’s
servant, and _me_ thy servant, I saw a
great tumult, but I knew not what
_it was._
30 And the king said _unto him,_
Turn aside, _and_ stand here. And he
turned aside, and stood still.
31 And, behold, Cushi came; and
Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
king: for the LORD hath avenged
thee this day of all them that rose
up against thee.
32 And the king said unto Cushi,
_Is_ the young man Absalom safe?
And Cushi answered, The enemies
of my lord the king, and all that
rise against thee to do _thee_ hurt, be
as _that_ young man _is._
33 ¶ And the king was much
moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and
as he went, thus he said, O my son
Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!
would God I had died for thee, O
Absalom, my son, my son!


CHAPTER 19


_Joab rebukes David for favoring his_
_enemies instead of his friends—David_
_replaces Joab with Amasa—Shimei,_
_who cursed David, is pardoned—Me-_
_phibosheth pledges allegiance to Da-_
_vid—The men of Judah take David_
_back to Jerusalem._


AND it was told Joab, Behold, the
king weepeth and mourneth for
Absalom.
2 And the victory that day was
_turned_ into mourning unto all the
people: for the people heard say
that day how the king was grieved
for his son.
3 And the people gat them by
stealth that day into the city, as
people being ashamed steal away
when they flee in battle.
4 But the king covered his face, and
the king cried with a loud voice, O
my son Absalom, O Absalom, my
son, my son!
5 And Joab came into the house to


453 2 SAMUEL 19:6–22












|the king, and said, Thou hast shamed<br>this day the faces of all thy servants,<br>which this day have saved thy life,<br>and the lives of thy sons and of thy<br>daughters, and the lives of thy wives,<br>and the lives of thy concubines;<br>6 In that thou lovest thine enemies,<br>and hatest thy friends. For thou hast<br>declared this day, that thou regard-<br>est neither princes nor servants: for<br>this day I perceive, that if Absalom<br>had lived, and all we had died this<br>day, then it had pleased thee well.<br>7 Now therefore arise, go forth,<br>and a speak comfortably unto thy<br>servants: for I swear by the LORD,<br>if thou go not forth, there will not<br>tarry one with thee this night: and<br>that will be worse unto thee than<br>all the evil that befell thee from<br>thy youth until now.<br>8 Then the king arose, and sat in<br>the gate. And they told unto all the<br>people, saying, Behold, the king<br>doth sit in the gate. And all the<br>people came before the king: for<br>Israel had fled every man to his<br>tent.<br>9 ¶ And all the people were at<br>a strife throughout all the tribes of<br>Israel, saying, The king saved us out<br>of the hand of our enemies, and he<br>delivered us out of the hand of the<br>Philistines; and now he is fled out<br>of the land for Absalom.<br>10 And Absalom, whom we<br>anointed over us, is dead in battle.<br>Now therefore why speak ye not a<br>word of bringing the king back?<br>11 ¶ And king David sent to a Za-<br>dok and to Abiathar the priests,<br>saying, Speak unto the elders of<br>Judah, saying, Why are ye the last<br>to bring the king back to his house?<br>seeing the speech of all Israel is<br>come to the king, even to his house.<br>12 Ye are my a brethren, ye are my<br>bones and my flesh: wherefore<br>then are ye the last to bring back<br>the king?|Col2|13 And say ye to aA masa, Art thou<br>not of my bone, and of my flesh? God<br>do so to me, and more also, if thou<br>be not captain of the host before<br>me continually in the room of Joab.<br>14 And he bowed the heart of all<br>the men of Judah, even as the heart<br>of one man; so that they sent this<br>word unto the king, Return thou,<br>and all thy servants.<br>15 So the king returned, and came<br>to Jordan. And Judah came to a Gil-<br>gal, to go to meet the king, to con-<br>duct the king over Jordan.<br>16 ¶ And a Shimei the son of Gera,<br>a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,<br>hasted and came down with the<br>men of Judah to meet king David.<br>17 And there were a thousand men<br>of Benjamin with him, and Ziba<br>the servant of the house of Saul,<br>and his fifteen sons and his twenty<br>servants with him; and they went<br>over Jordan before the king.<br>18 And there went over a ferry boat<br>to carry over the king’s household,<br>and to do what he thought good.<br>And Shimei the son of Gera fell<br>down before the king, as he was<br>come over Jordan;<br>19 And said unto the king, Let<br>not my lord impute iniquity unto<br>me, neither do thou remember that<br>which thy servant did perversely the<br>day that my lord the king went out<br>of Jerusalem, that the king should<br>take it to his heart.<br>20 For thy servant doth know that<br>I have sinned: therefore, behold, I<br>am come the first this day of all<br>the house of Joseph to go down to<br>meet my lord the king.<br>21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah<br>answered and said, Shall not Shimei<br>be put to death for this, because he<br>a cursed the LORD’s b anointed?<br>22 And David said, What have I to do<br>with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye<br>should this day be adversaries unto<br>me? shall there any man be put to|Col4|

I have said, Thou and Ziba<br>divide the land.<br>30 And Mephibosheth said unto<br>the king, Yea, let him take all, for-<br>asmuch as my lord the king is come<br>again in peace unto his own house.<br>31 ¶ And a Barzillai the Gilead-<br>ite came down from Rogelim, and<br>went over Jordan with the king, to<br>conduct him over Jordan.<br>32 Now a Barzillai was a very aged<br>man, even fourscore years old: and<br>he had provided the king of suste-<br>nance while he lay at Mahanaim;<br>for he was a very great man.|Col2|33 And the king said unto Barzil-<br>lai, Come thou over with me, and I<br>will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.<br>34 And Barzillai said unto the<br>king, How long have I to live, that<br>I should go up with the king unto<br>Jerusalem?<br>35 I am this day fourscore years old:<br>and can I discern between good and<br>evil? can thy servant taste what I<br>eat or what I drink? can I hear any<br>more the voice of singing men and<br>singing women? wherefore then<br>should thy servant be yet a burden<br>unto my lord the king?<br>36 Thy servant will go a little way<br>over Jordan with the king: and why<br>should the king recompense it me<br>with such a reward?<br>37 Let thy servant, I pray thee,<br>turn back again, that I may die<br>in mine own city, and be buried by<br>the grave of my father and of my<br>mother. But behold thy servant<br>Chimham; let him go over with my<br>lord the king; and do to him what<br>shall seem good unto thee.<br>38 And the king answered, Chim-<br>ham shall go over with me, and<br>I will do to him that which shall<br>seem good unto thee: and whatso-<br>ever thou shalt require of me, that<br>will I do for thee.<br>39 And all the people went over<br>Jordan. And when the king was<br>come over, the king kissed Barzillai,<br>and blessed him; and he returned<br>unto his own place.<br>40 Then the king went on to Gil-<br>gal, and Chimham went on with<br>him: and all the people of Judah<br>conducted the king, and also half<br>the people of Israel.<br>41 ¶ And, behold, all the men of<br>Israel came to the king, and said<br>unto the king, Why have our breth-<br>ren the men of Judah stolen thee<br>away, and have brought the king,<br>and his household, and all David’s<br>a men with him, over Jordan?<br>42 And all the men of Judah an-<br>swered the men of Israel, Because|Col4|

|the king is near of a kin to us: where-<br>fore then be ye angry for this mat-<br>ter? have we eaten at all of the king’s<br>cost? or hath he given us any gift?<br>43 And the men of Israel answered<br>the men of Judah, and said, We<br>have ten parts in the king, and we<br>have also more right in David than<br>ye: why then did ye despise us, that<br>our advice should not be first had<br>in bringing back our king? And<br>the words of the men of Judah were<br>fiercer than the words of the men<br>of Israel.<br>CHAPTER 20<br>Sheba leads the tribes of Israel away<br>from David—Joab slays Amasa and<br>pursues Sheba—A wise woman inter-<br>cedes—The death of Sheba ends the<br>insurrection.<br>AND there happened to be there<br>a man of a Belial, whose name was<br>Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjam-<br>ite: and he blew a trumpet, and<br>said, We have no part in David,<br>neither have we inheritance in the<br>son of Jesse: every man to his tents,<br>O Israel.<br>2 So every man of Israel went<br>up from after David, and followed<br>Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men<br>of Judah clave unto their king, from<br>Jordan even to Jerusalem.<br>3 ¶ And David came to his house<br>at Jerusalem; and the king took the<br>ten women his a concubines, whom<br>he had left to keep the house, and<br>put them in ward, and fed them,<br>but went not in unto them. So they<br>were shut up unto the day of their<br>death, living in widowhood.<br>4 ¶ Then said the king to aA masa,<br>Assemble me the men of Judah<br>within three days, and be thou<br>here present.<br>5 So Amasa went to assemble the<br>men of Judah: but he tarried longer<br>than the set time which he had<br>appointed him.<br>6 And David said to Abishai, Now|Col2|shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us<br>more harm than did Absalom: take<br>thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue<br>after him, lest he get him a fenced<br>cities, and escape us.<br>7 And there went out after him Jo-<br>ab’s men, and the Cherethites, and<br>the Pelethites, and all the mighty<br>men: and they went out of Jerusa-<br>lem, to pursue after Sheba the son<br>of Bichri.<br>8 When they were at the great<br>stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa<br>went before them. And Joab’s gar-<br>ment that he had put on was girded<br>unto him, and upon it a girdle with<br>a sword fastened upon his loins in<br>the sheath thereof; and as he went<br>forth it fell out.<br>9 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou<br>in health, my brother? And Joab<br>took Amasa by the beard with the<br>right hand to a kiss him.<br>10 But aA masa took no heed to the<br>sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he<br>smote him therewith in the b fifth<br>rib, and shed out his bowels to the<br>ground, and struck him not again;<br>and he died. So Joab and Abishai<br>his brother pursued after Sheba the<br>son of Bichri.<br>11 And one of Joab’s men stood<br>by him, and said, He that favour-<br>eth Joab, and he that is for David,<br>let him go after Joab.<br>12 And Amasa wallowed in blood<br>in the midst of the highway.

|15 And they came and besieged<br>him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and<br>they cast up a bank against the city,<br>and it stood in the trench: and all<br>the people that were with Joab bat-<br>tered the wall, to throw it down.<br>16 ¶ Then cried a wise woman out<br>of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray<br>you, unto Joab, Come near hither,<br>that I may speak with thee.<br>17 And when he was come near<br>unto her, the woman said, Art thou<br>Joab? And he answered, I am he.<br>Then she said unto him, Hear the<br>words of thine handmaid. And he<br>answered, I do hear.<br>18 Then she spake, saying, They<br>were wont to speak in old time, say-<br>ing, They shall surely ask counsel at<br>Abel: and so they ended the matter.<br>19 I am one of them that are peace-<br>able and faithful in Israel: thou seek-<br>est to destroy a city and a mother<br>in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up<br>the inheritance of the LORD?<br>20 And Joab answered and said,<br>Far be it, far be it from me, that I<br>should swallow up or a destroy.<br>21 The matter is not so: but a man<br>of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son<br>of Bichri by name, hath lifted up<br>his hand against the king, even<br>against David: deliver him only, and<br>I will depart from the city. And the<br>woman said unto Joab, Behold, his<br>head shall be thrown to thee over<br>the wall.<br>22 Then the woman went unto all<br>the people in her wisdom. And they<br>cut off the head of Sheba the son<br>of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.<br>And he blew a trumpet, and they<br>retired from the city, every man<br>to his tent. And Joab returned to<br>Jerusalem unto the king.<br>23 ¶ Now a Joab was over all the<br>host of Israel: and Benaiah the son<br>of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites<br>and over the Pelethites:<br>24 And Adoram was over the trib-<br>ute: and Jehoshaphat the son of<br>Ahilud was recorder:|Col2|25 And Sheva was scribe: and<br>Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:<br>26 And Ira also the Jairite was a<br>chief ruler about David.<br>CHAPTER 21<br>The Lord sends a famine—David un-<br>derstands that the famine came because<br>Saul smote the Gibeonites, contrary to<br>the oath of Israel—David delivers up<br>seven sons of Saul to be hanged by the<br>Gibeonites—Israel and the Philistines<br>continue their wars.<br>THEN there was a famine in the<br>days of David three years, year af-<br>ter year; and David inquired of the<br>LORD. And the LORD answered, It is<br>for Saul, and for his bloody house,<br>because he slew the Gibeonites.<br>2 And the king called the Gibeon-<br>ites, and said unto them; (now the<br>a Gibeonites were not of the children<br>of Israel, but of the remnant of the<br>Amorites; and the children of Israel<br>had sworn unto them: and Saul<br>sought to slay them in his zeal to<br>the children of Israel and Judah.)<br>3 Wherefore David said unto the<br>Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?<br>and wherewith shall I make the<br>atonement, that ye may bless the<br>inheritance of the LORD?<br>4 And the Gibeonites said unto<br>him, We will have no silver nor gold<br>of Saul, nor of his house; neither<br>for us shalt thou kill any man in<br>Israel. And he said, What ye shall<br>say, that will I do for you.<br>5 And they answered the king, The<br>man that consumed us, and that de-<br>vised against us that we should be<br>destroyed from remaining in any<br>of the a coasts of Israel,<br>6 Let seven men of his a sons be de-<br>livered unto us, and we will hang<br>them up unto the LORD in b Gibeah<br>of Saul, whom the LORD did choose.<br>And the king said, I will give them.<br>7 But the king spared Mephibo-<br>sheth, the son of Jonathan the son<br>of Saul, because of the LORD’s a oath|Col4|

And after that God<br>was entreated for the land.<br>15 ¶ Moreover the Philistines had<br>yet war again with Israel; and Da-<br>vid went down, and his servants<br>with him, and fought against the<br>Philistines: and David waxed faint.|Col2|16 And Ishbi-benob, which was of<br>the sons of the giant, the weight of<br>whose spear weighed three hundred<br>shekels of brass in weight, he being<br>girded with a new sword, thought<br>to have slain David.<br>17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah<br>a succoured him, and smote the<br>Philistine, and killed him.

2 SAMUEL 23:5–25 460








|5 Although my house be not so with<br>God; yet he hath made with me an<br>a everlasting covenant, ordered in all<br>things, and sure: for this is all my sal-<br>vation, and all my desire, although<br>he make it not to grow.<br>6 ¶ But the sons of Belial shall be<br>all of them as thorns thrust away,<br>because they cannot be taken with<br>hands:<br>7 But the man that shall touch<br>them must be a fenced with iron<br>and the staff of a spear; and they<br>shall be utterly burned with fire<br>in the same place.<br>8 ¶ These be the names of the<br>a mighty men whom David had: The<br>Tachmonite that sat in the seat,<br>chief among the captains; the same<br>was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his<br>spear against eight hundred, whom<br>he slew at one time.<br>9 And after him was Eleazar the<br>son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the<br>three mighty men with David, when<br>they defied the Philistines that were<br>there gathered together to battle, and<br>the men of Israel were gone away:<br>10 He arose, and smote the Philis-<br>tines until his hand was weary, and<br>his hand clave unto the sword: and<br>the LORD wrought a great victory<br>that day; and the people returned<br>after him only to spoil.<br>11 And after him was Shammah the<br>son of Agee the Hararite. And the<br>Philistines were gathered together<br>into a troop, where was a piece of<br>ground full of lentiles: and the peo-<br>ple fled from the Philistines.<br>12 But he stood in the midst of<br>the ground, and defended it, and<br>slew the Philistines: and the LORD<br>wrought a great victory.<br>13 And three of the thirty chief<br>went down, and came to David<br>in the harvest time unto the cave<br>of Adullam: and the troop of the<br>Philistines pitched in the valley<br>of Rephaim.<br>14 And David was then in an hold,<br>and the garrison of the Philistines<br>was then in Beth-lehem.|Col2|15 And David longed, and said,<br>Oh that one would give me drink<br>of the water of the well of Beth-<br>lehem, which is by the gate!<br>16 And the three mighty men<br>brake through the host of the Phi-<br>listines, and drew water out of the<br>well of Beth-lehem, that was by the<br>gate, and took it, and brought it to<br>David: nevertheless he would not<br>drink thereof, but poured it out<br>unto the LORD.<br>17 And he said, Be it far from me,<br>O LORD, that I should do this: is not<br>this the blood of the men that went<br>in jeopardy of their lives? therefore<br>he would not drink it. These things<br>did these three mighty men.<br>18 And Abishai, the brother of<br>Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief<br>among three. And he lifted up<br>his spear against three hundred,<br>and slew them, and had the name<br>among three.<br>19 Was he not most a honourable<br>of three? therefore he was their<br>captain: howbeit he attained not<br>unto the first three.<br>20 And a Benaiah the son of Jehoi-<br>ada, the son of a valiant man, of<br>Kabzeel, who had done many acts,<br>he slew two lionlike men of Moab:<br>he went down also and slew a lion<br>in the midst of a pit in time of snow:<br>21 And he slew an Egyptian, a<br>goodly man: and the Egyptian had a<br>spear in his hand; but he went down<br>to him with a staff, and plucked<br>the spear out of the Egyptian’s<br>hand, and slew him with his own<br>spear.<br>22 These things did Benaiah the<br>son of Jehoiada, and had the name<br>among three mighty men.<br>23 He was more honourable than<br>the thirty, but he attained not to<br>the first three. And David set him<br>over his guard.<br>24 Asahel the brother of Joab was<br>one of the thirty; Elhanan the son<br>of Dodo of Beth-lehem,<br>25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika<br>the Harodite,|Col4|

And the an-<br>gel of the LORD was by the thresh-<br>ingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.<br>17 And David spake unto the LORD<br>when he saw the angel that smote<br>the people, and said, Lo, I have<br>sinned, and I have done wickedly:<br>but these sheep, what have they<br>done? let thine hand, I pray thee,<br>be against me, and against my<br>father’s house.<br>18 ¶ And Gad came that day to<br>David, and said unto him, Go up,<br>rear an a altar unto the LORD in|Col2|the threshingfloor of Araunah the<br>Jebusite.<br>19 And David, according to the<br>saying of Gad, went up as the LORD<br>commanded.<br>20 And Araunah looked, and saw<br>the king and his servants coming<br>on toward him: and Araunah went<br>out, and bowed himself before the<br>king on his face upon the ground.<br>21 And Araunah said, Wherefore<br>is my lord the king come to his ser-<br>vant? And David said, To buy the<br>threshingfloor of thee, to build an<br>altar unto the LORD, that the plague<br>may be stayed from the people.<br>22 And Araunah said unto David,<br>Let my lord the king take and offer<br>up what seemeth good unto him: be-<br>hold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice,<br>and threshing instruments and other<br>instruments of the oxen for wood.<br>23 All these things did Araunah,<br>as a king, give unto the king. And<br>Araunah said unto the king, The<br>LORD thy God accept thee.<br>24 And the king said unto Araunah,<br>Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee<br>at a price: neither will I offer burnt<br>offerings unto the LORD my God of<br>that which doth cost me nothing.<br>So David bought the threshingfloor<br>and the oxen for a fifty shekels of<br>silver.<br>25 And David built there an a altar<br>unto the LORD, and offered burnt<br>offerings and peace b offerings.
