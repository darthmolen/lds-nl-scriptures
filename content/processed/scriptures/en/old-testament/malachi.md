ZECHARIAH 14:13–MALACHI 1:2 1180



the people that have fought against
Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon
their feet, and their eyes shall
consume away in their holes, and
their tongue shall consume away
in their mouth.
13 And it shall come to pass in
that day, _that_ a great tumult from
the LORD shall be among them;
and they shall lay hold every one
on the hand of his neighbour, and
his hand shall rise up against the
hand of his _**[a ]**_ neighbour.
14 And Judah also shall fight
at Jerusalem; and the wealth of
all the _**[a ]**_ heathen round about shall
be gathered together, gold, and
silver, and apparel, in great abundance.
15 _**[a ]**_ And so shall be the plague of
the horse, of the mule, of the camel,
and of the ass, and of all the beasts
that shall be in these _**[b ]**_ tents, as this
plague.
16 ¶ And it shall come to pass,
_that_ every one that is left of all the
nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year
to year to _**[a ]**_ worship the _**[b ]**_ King, the



LORD of hosts, and to keep the _**[c ]**_ feast
of _**[d ]**_ tabernacles.
17 And it shall be, _that_ whoso will
not come up of _all_ the families of
the earth unto Jerusalem to worship
the King, the LORD of hosts, even
upon them shall be no rain.
18 And if the family of Egypt go
not up, and come not, that _have_
no _rain;_ there shall be the plague,
wherewith the LORD will smite the
_**a**_ heathen that come not up to keep
the feast of tabernacles.
19 This shall be the punishment
of Egypt, and the punishment of all
nations that come not up to keep
the feast of tabernacles.
20 ¶ In that day shall there be upon
the bells of the horses, _**[a ]**_ HOLINESS
UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in
the LORD’s house shall be like the
bowls before the altar.
21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and
in Judah shall be _**[a ]**_ holiness unto
the LORD of hosts: and all they
that sacrifice shall come and take
of them, and _**[b ]**_ seethe therein: and
in that day there shall be no more
the _**[c ]**_ Canaanite in the house of the
LORD of hosts.
