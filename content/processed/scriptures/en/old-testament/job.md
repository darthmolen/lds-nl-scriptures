ESTHER 9:27–JOB 1:1 678



Therefore for all the words of this
letter, and _of that_ which they had
seen concerning this matter, and
which had come unto them,
27 The Jews ordained, and took
upon them, and upon their seed,
and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not
fail, that they would keep these two
days according to their writing, and
according to their _appointed_ time
every year;
28 And _that_ these days _should be_
remembered and kept throughout
every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and
_that_ these days of Purim should
not fail from among the Jews, nor
the memorial of them perish from
their seed.
29 Then Esther the queen, the
_**a**_ daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
the Jew, wrote with all authority, to
confirm this second _**[b ]**_ letter of Purim.
30 And he sent the letters unto all
the Jews, to the hundred twenty
and seven _**[a ]**_ provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, _with_ words of
peace and truth,
31 To confirm these days of Purim



in their times _appointed,_ according
as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the
queen had enjoined them, and as
they had decreed for themselves
and for their seed, the matters of
the _**[a ]**_ fastings and their cry.
32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
it was written in the book.


CHAPTER 10


_Mordecai, the Jew, stands next to Aha-_
_suerus in power and might._


AND the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and _upon_ the
isles of the sea.
2 And all the acts of his power and
of his might, and the declaration of
the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king _**[a ]**_ advanced him, _are_
they not written in the book of the
_**b**_ chronicles of the kings of Media
and Persia?
3 For Mordecai the _**[a ]**_ Jew _was_ _**[b ]**_ next
unto king Ahasuerus, and great
among the Jews, and accepted of
the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and
speaking peace to all his seed.
