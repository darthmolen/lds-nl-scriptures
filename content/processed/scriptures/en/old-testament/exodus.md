|CHAPTER 1<br>The children of Israel multiply—They<br>are placed in bondage by the Egyp-<br>tians—Pharaoh seeks to destroy the<br>sons born to Hebrew women.<br>N<br>OW these are the a names of<br>the b children of Israel, which<br>came c into d Egypt; every man<br>and his household came with Jacob.<br>2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,<br>3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,<br>4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and<br>Asher.<br>5 And all the souls that came out<br>of the loins of aJ acob were seventy<br>souls: for Joseph was in Egypt al-<br>ready.<br>6 And a Joseph died, and all his<br>brethren, and all that generation.<br>7 ¶ And the children of Israel<br>were a fruitful, and b increased abun-<br>dantly, and multiplied, and c waxed<br>exceeding mighty; and the land was<br>filled with them.<br>8 Now there arose up a new a king<br>over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.<br>9 And he said unto his people,<br>Behold, the people of the children<br>of Israel are a more and b mightier<br>than we:|Col2|10 Come on, let us deal a wisely<br>with them; lest they multiply, and it<br>come to pass, that, when there b fall-<br>eth out any war, they join also unto<br>our enemies, and fight against us,<br>and so get them up out of the land.<br>11 Therefore they did set over<br>them a taskmasters to afflict them<br>with their b burdens. And they built<br>for Pharaoh c treasure cities, Pithom<br>and d Raamses.<br>12 But the more they afflicted<br>them, the more they a multiplied<br>and grew. And they were b grieved<br>because of the children of Israel.<br>13 And the Egyptians made the<br>children of Israel to serve with<br>rigour:<br>14 And they made their lives bit-<br>ter with hard a bondage, in mortar,<br>and in brick, and in all manner of<br>service in the field: all their service,<br>wherein they made them serve, was<br>with rigour.<br>15 ¶ And the king of Egypt spake<br>to the Hebrew midwives, of which<br>the name of the one was Shiphrah,<br>and the name of the other Puah:<br>16 And he said, When ye a do the<br>office of a midwife to the Hebrew<br>women, and see them upon the|Col4|

And she had compassion<br>on him, and said, This is one of the<br>Hebrews’ children.<br>7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s<br>daughter, Shall I go and call to thee<br>a nurse of the Hebrew women, that<br>she may nurse the child for thee?<br>8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to<br>her, Go. And the maid went and<br>called the child’s mother.<br>9 And Pharaoh’s daughter said<br>unto her, Take this child away, and<br>nurse it for me, and I will give thee<br>thy wages. And the woman took the<br>child, and nursed it.<br>10 And the child grew, and she<br>brought him unto Pharaoh’s daugh-<br>ter, and he became her a son.

And Moses feared,<br>and said, Surely this thing is known.<br>15 Now when Pharaoh heard this<br>thing, he sought to a slay Moses.<br>But Moses b fled from c the face of<br>Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of<br>Midian: and he sat down by a well.<br>16 Now the priest of a Midian had<br>seven daughters: and they came and<br>drew b water, and filled the troughs<br>to water their father’s flock.<br>17 And the shepherds came and<br>drove them away: but Moses stood<br>up and helped them, and watered<br>their flock.<br>18 And when they came to a Reuel<br>their father, he said, How is it that<br>ye are come so soon to day ?<br>19 And they said, An Egyptian<br>delivered us out of the hand of<br>the shepherds, and also drew water<br>enough for us, and watered the flock.<br>20 And he said unto his daughters,<br>And where is he? why is it that ye<br>have left the man? call him, that<br>he may eat bread.<br>21 And Moses was content to dwell<br>with the man: and he gave Moses<br>a Zipporah his daughter.<br>22 And she bare him a a son, and<br>he called his name b Gershom: for<br>he said, I have been a c stranger in<br>a strange land.<br>23 ¶ And it came to pass in pro-<br>cess of time, that the king of Egypt|Col2|a died: and the children of Israel<br>sighed by reason of the bondage, and<br>they b cried, and their c cry came up<br>unto God by reason of the bondage.<br>24 And God a heard their groan-<br>ing, and God remembered his b cov-<br>enant with Abraham, with Isaac,<br>and with Jacob.<br>25 And God looked upon the chil-<br>dren of Israel, a and God had respect<br>unto them.<br>CHAPTER 3<br>The Lord appears to Moses at the burn-<br>ing bush—Moses is called to deliver<br>Israel from bondage—The Lord iden-<br>tifies Himself as the God of Abraham,<br>Isaac, and Jacob, and as the Great<br>I AM—He promises to smite Egypt<br>and bring His people out with great<br>wealth.<br>NOW Moses kept the flock of aJ ethro<br>his father in law, the b priest of<br>Midian: and he led the flock to the<br>backside of the desert, and came<br>to the c mountain of God, even to<br>d Horeb.<br>2 And the a angel of the LORD ap-<br>peared unto him in a flame of b fire<br>out of the midst of a c bush: and<br>he looked, and, behold, the bush<br>burned with fire, and the bush was<br>not consumed.<br>3 And Moses said, I will now turn<br>aside, and see this great sight, why<br>the bush is not burnt.<br>4 And when the LORD saw that he<br>turned aside to see, God a called unto<br>him out of the midst of the bush,|Col4|

|Egypt, and my signs which I have<br>done among them; that ye may know<br>how that I am the LORD.<br>3 And Moses and Aaron came in<br>unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,<br>Thus saith the LORD God of the He-<br>brews, How long wilt thou refuse to<br>a humble thyself before me? let my<br>people go, that they may serve me.<br>4 Else, if thou refuse to let my<br>people go, behold, to morrow will<br>I bring the a locusts into thy coast:<br>5 And they shall cover the face of<br>the earth, that one cannot be able<br>to see the earth: and they shall eat<br>the a residue of that which is escaped,<br>which remaineth unto you from the<br>hail, and shall eat every tree which<br>groweth for you out of the field:<br>6 And they shall fill thy houses,<br>and the houses of all thy servants,<br>and the houses of all the Egyptians;<br>which neither thy fathers, nor thy<br>fathers’ fathers have seen, since the<br>day that they were upon the earth<br>unto this day. And he turned him-<br>self, and went out from Pharaoh.<br>7 And Pharaoh’s servants said unto<br>him, How long shall this man be a<br>a snare unto us? let the men go, that<br>they may serve the LORD their God:<br>knowest thou not yet that Egypt is<br>b destroyed?<br>8 And Moses and Aaron were brought<br>again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto<br>them, Go, serve the LORD your God:<br>but who are they that shall go?<br>9 And Moses said, We will go with<br>our young and with our a old, with<br>our sons and with our daughters,<br>with our flocks and with our herds<br>will we go; for we must hold a b feast<br>unto the LORD.<br>10 And he said unto them, Let the<br>LORD be so with you, a as I will let<br>you go, and your little ones: look<br>to it; for b evil is before you.<br>11 Not so: go now ye that are men,|Col2|and serve the LORD; for that ye did<br>desire. And they were driven out<br>from Pharaoh’s presence.<br>12 ¶ And the LORD said unto Mo-<br>ses, Stretch out thine hand over the<br>land of Egypt for the locusts, that<br>they may come up upon the land<br>of Egypt, and eat every herb of the<br>land, even all that the hail hath left.<br>13 And Moses stretched forth his<br>rod over the land of Egypt, and the<br>LORD brought an east wind upon<br>the land all that day, and all that<br>night; and when it was morning,<br>the east wind brought the locusts.<br>14 And the a locusts went up over<br>all the land of Egypt, and rested b in<br>all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous<br>were they; before them there were<br>no such locusts as they, neither af-<br>ter them shall be such.<br>15 For they covered the face of the<br>whole earth, so that the land was<br>darkened; and they did eat every<br>herb of the land, and all the fruit of<br>the trees which the hail had left: and<br>there remained not any green thing<br>in the trees, or in the herbs of the<br>field, through all the land of Egypt.<br>16 ¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses<br>and Aaron in haste; and he said, I<br>have sinned against the LORD your<br>God, and against you.<br>17 Now therefore forgive, I pray<br>thee, my sin only this once, and en-<br>treat the LORD your God, that he may<br>take away from me this death only.<br>18 And he went out from Pharaoh,<br>and entreated the LORD.<br>19 And the LORD turned a mighty<br>strong west wind, which took away<br>the locusts, and cast them into the<br>a Red sea; there remained not one<br>locust in all the coasts of Egypt.<br>20 a But the LORD hardened Pha-<br>raoh’s heart, so that he would not<br>let the children of Israel go.<br>21 ¶ And the LORD said unto|Col4|
