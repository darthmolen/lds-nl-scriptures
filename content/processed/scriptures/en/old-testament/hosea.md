HOSEA












|CHAPTER 1<br>Hosea and his family are a sign unto<br>Israel—In the day of gathering, the<br>people of Israel will become the sons<br>of the living God.<br>T<br>HE word of the LORD that<br>came unto Hosea, the son of<br>Beeri, in the days of a Uzziah,<br>Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings<br>of Judah, and in the days of Jero-<br>boam the son of Joash, king of Israel.<br>2 The beginning of the word of<br>the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD<br>said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a<br>a wife of whoredoms and children<br>of whoredoms: for the land hath<br>committed great b whoredom, de-<br>parting from the LORD.<br>3 So he went and took Gomer the<br>daughter of Diblaim; which con-<br>ceived, and bare him a son.<br>4 And the LORD said unto him,<br>Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little<br>while, and I will avenge the blood<br>of Jezreel upon the house of aJ ehu,<br>and will cause to b cease the king-<br>dom of the house of Israel.<br>5 And it shall come to pass at that<br>day, that I will a break the bow of<br>Israel in the valley of Jezreel.<br>6 ¶ And she conceived again, and<br>bare a daughter. And God said unto<br>him, Call her name a Lo-ruhamah:<br>for I will b no more have mercy upon<br>the house of Israel; but I will utterly<br>take them c away.|Col2|7 But I will have a mercy upon<br>the house of bJ udah, and will save<br>them by the LORD their God, and<br>will not save them by bow, nor by<br>sword, nor by battle, by c horses, nor<br>by horsemen.<br>8 ¶ Now when she had weaned<br>Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and<br>bare a son.<br>9 Then said God, Call his name<br>a Lo-ammi: for ye are not my people,<br>and I will not be your God.<br>10 ¶ Yet the a number of the chil-<br>dren of Israel shall be as the b sand of<br>the sea, which cannot be measured<br>nor numbered; and it shall come to<br>pass, that in the place where it was<br>said unto them, Ye are not my peo-<br>ple, there it shall be said unto them,<br>Ye are the c sons of the d living God.<br>11 Then shall the children of Ju-<br>dah and the children of Israel be<br>a gathered together, and appoint<br>themselves one head, and they shall<br>come up out of the land: for great<br>shall be the day of Jezreel.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>Worshipping false gods brings severe<br>judgments upon Israel—In the last<br>days, Israel will be reconciled to God<br>and become His people.<br>SAY ye unto your brethren, aA mmi;<br>and to your sisters, b Ruhamah.<br>2 Plead with your a mother, plead:<br>for she is not my wife, neither am I|Col4|
