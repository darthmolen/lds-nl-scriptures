GENESIS












|CHAPTER 1<br>God creates this earth and its heaven<br>and all forms of life in six days—The<br>creative acts of each day are described—<br>God creates man, both male and female,<br>in His own image—Man is given domin-<br>ion over all things and is commanded<br>to multiply and fill the earth.<br>I<br>N the a beginning b God c created<br>the d heaven and the e earth.<br>2 And the earth was without<br>a form, and void; and b darkness was<br>upon the face of the deep. And the<br>c Spirit of God d moved upon the face<br>of the waters.<br>3 And God a said, Let there be b light:<br>and there was light.<br>4 And God saw the light, that it<br>was a good: and God divided the<br>light from the darkness.<br>5 And God called the light a Day,<br>and the b darkness he called Night.<br>And the evening and the morning<br>were the c first d day.<br>6 ¶ And God said, Let there be<br>a a firmament in the midst of the<br>waters, and let it divide the waters<br>from the waters.<br>7 And God made the firmament,|Col2|and divided the a waters which were<br>under the firmament from the wa-<br>ters which were above the firmament:<br>and it was so.<br>8 And God called the firmament<br>a Heaven. And the evening and the<br>morning were the second b day.<br>9 ¶ And God said, Let the a waters<br>under the heaven be gathered to-<br>gether unto b one place, and let the<br>dry land appear: and it was so.<br>10 And God called the dry land<br>a Earth; and the gathering together<br>of the waters called he Seas: and<br>God saw that it was good.<br>11 And God said, Let the earth<br>bring forth a grass, the herb yield-<br>ing seed, and the fruit tree yielding<br>fruit after his kind, whose seed is in<br>itself, upon the earth: and it was so.<br>12 And the earth a brought forth<br>grass, and herb yielding seed after<br>his kind, and the tree yielding fruit,<br>whose seed was in itself, after his<br>b kind: and God saw that it was good.<br>13 And the evening and the morn-<br>ing were the third day.<br>14 ¶ And God said, Let there be<br>a lights in the firmament of the<br>heaven to divide the day from the|Col4|
