CHAPTER 1

God creates this earth and its heaven
and all forms of life in six days—The
creative acts of each day are described—
God creates man, both male and female,
in His own image—Man is given dominion
over all things and is commanded
to multiply and fill the earth.
I
N the a beginning b God c created
the d heaven and the e earth.
2 And the earth was without
a form, and void; and b darkness was
upon the face of the deep. And the
c Spirit of God d moved upon the face
of the waters.

3 And God a said, Let there be b light:
and there was light.

4 And God saw the light, that it
was a good: and God divided the
light from the darkness.

5 And God called the light a Day,
and the b darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning
were the c first d day.

6 ¶ And God said, Let there be
a a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the waters
from the waters.

7 And God made the firmament,

and divided the a waters which were
under the firmament from the waters
which were above the firmament:
and it was so.

8 And God called the firmament
a Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second b day.
9 ¶ And God said, Let the a waters
under the heaven be gathered together
unto b one place, and let the
dry land appear: and it was so.
10 And God called the dry land
a Earth; and the gathering together
of the waters called he Seas: and
God saw that it was good.

11 And God said, Let the earth
bring forth a grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding
fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12 And the earth a brought forth
grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit,
whose seed was in itself, after his
b kind: and God saw that it was good.
13 And the evening and the morning
were the third day.

14 ¶ And God said, Let there be
a lights in the firmament of the
heaven to divide the day from the
GENESIS 1:15–30 2

night; and let them be for b signs, and
for c seasons, and for days, and years:
15 And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give
light upon the earth: and it was so.
16 And God made two great lights;
the a greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night:
he made the b stars also.

17 And God set them in the a firmament
of the heaven to give light
upon the earth,

18 And to rule over the a day and
over the night, and to divide the
light from the darkness: and God
saw that it was good.

19 And the evening and the morning
were the fourth day.

20 And God said, Let the a waters
b bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and c fowl
that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.

21 And God created a great whales,
and every living creature that moveth,
which the waters brought forth
abundantly, after their kind, and
every winged fowl after his kind:
and God saw that it was good.

22 And God blessed them, saying,
Be fruitful, and a multiply, and fill
the waters in the seas, and let fowl
multiply in the earth.

23 And the evening and the morning
were the fifth day.

24 ¶ And God said, Let the earth
bring forth the living creature after

his a kind, cattle, and creeping thing,
and beast of the earth after his kind:
and it was so.

25 And God made the beast of the
earth after his kind, and cattle after
their kind, and every thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
26 ¶ And God said, Let a us b make
c man in our d image, after our e likeness:
and let them have f dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over
the fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth.

27 So God created man in his own
a image, in the image of God created
he him; male and b female created he
them.

28 And God blessed them, and God
said unto them, Be a fruitful, and
b multiply, and c replenish the d earth,
and subdue it: and have e dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.
29 ¶ And God said, Behold, I have
given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the
earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed;
to you it shall be for a meat.

30 And to every beast of the earth,
and to every fowl of the air, and to
every thing that creepeth upon the
earth, wherein there is life, I have

given every green herb for a meat:
and it was so.

31 And God saw every thing that
he had made, and, behold, it was
very a good. And the evening and
the morning were the b sixth day.

CHAPTER 2

The Creation is completed—God rests
on the seventh day—The prior spirit
creation is explained—Adam and Eve
are placed in the Garden of Eden—
They are forbidden to eat of the tree
of knowledge of good and evil—Adam
names every living creature—Adam and
Eve are married by the Lord.

THUS the heavens and the a earth
were finished, and all the b host of
them.

2 And on the seventh day God
ended his work which he had a made;
and he b rested on the seventh day
from all his c work which he had
made.

3 And God blessed the a seventh
day, and b sanctified it: because that
in it he had c rested from all his work
which God d created and made.

4 ¶ These are the generations of
the heavens and of the earth when
they were a created, in the day that

the b LORD God made the earth and
the heavens,

5 And every a plant of the field b before
it was in the c earth, and every
herb of the field before it grew: for
the LORD God had not caused it to
rain upon the earth, and there was
not a d man to till the e ground.

6 But there went up a a mist from
the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.

7 And the LORD God a formed
b man of the c dust of the ground,
and breathed into his nostrils the
d breath of life; and e man became a
living f soul.

8 ¶ And the LORD God planted
a garden eastward in a Eden; and
there he put the man whom he
had formed.

9 And out of the ground made the
LORD God to grow every tree that
is pleasant to the a sight, and good
for b food; the c tree of d life also in
the midst of the garden, and the
tree of e knowledge of good and evil.
10 And a river went out of a Eden
to water the garden; and from
thence it was b parted, and became
into four heads.

13 And the name of the second
river is Gihon: the same is it that
a compasseth the whole land of
b Ethiopia.

14 And the name of the third river
is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth
toward the east of Assyria. And the
fourth river is Euphrates.

15 And the LORD God took the
man, and put him into the a garden
of b Eden c to dress it and to d keep it.
16 And the LORD God a commanded
the man, saying, Of every tree of
the garden thou mayest b freely eat:
17 But of the a tree of the b knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not
eat of it: for in the c day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely d die.
18 ¶ And the LORD God said, It is
not good that the man should be
a alone; I will make him b an help
meet for him.

19 And out of the ground the
LORD God formed every beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air; and
brought them unto a Adam to see
what he would call them: and whatsoever
Adam called every living
creature, that was the b name thereof.
20 And Adam gave names to all
cattle, and to the fowl of the air,

and to every beast of the field; but
for Adam there was not found an
help meet for him.

21 And the LORD God caused a
deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and
he slept: and he took one of his
ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof;

22 And the rib, which the LORD
God had taken from man, made he
a a woman, and brought her unto
the man.

23 And Adam said, This is now
bone of my bones, and a flesh of my
flesh: she shall be called b Woman,
because she was taken out of Man.
24 Therefore shall a a man leave his
b father and his mother, and shall
c cleave unto his d wife: and they
shall be e one flesh.

25 And they were both a naked,
the man and his wife, and were
not b ashamed.

the LORD God had made. And he
said unto the woman, c Yea, hath
God said, Ye shall not eat of every
tree of the garden?

2 And the woman said unto the
serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
the trees of the garden:

3 But of the fruit of the a tree which
is in the midst of the garden, God
hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither
shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
4 And the serpent said unto the
woman, a Ye shall not surely die:
5 For God doth know that in the
day ye eat thereof, then your a eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as
gods, b knowing good and c evil.

6 And when the woman saw that
the tree was good for a food, and that
it was b pleasant to the eyes, and a
tree c to be desired to make one wise,
she took of the d fruit thereof, and
did e eat, and gave also unto her
husband with her; and he did f eat.
7 And the eyes of them both were
a opened, and they knew that they
were b naked; and they sewed fig
leaves together, and made themselves
c aprons.

8 And they heard the voice of the
LORD God a walking in the garden b in
the cool of the day: and Adam and
his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God amongst
the trees of the garden.

9 And the LORD God called unto
Adam, and said unto him, Where
art thou?

10 And he said, I heard thy voice
in the garden, and I was afraid, because
I was naked; and I hid myself.
11 And he said, Who told thee
that thou wast naked? Hast thou
eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded
thee that thou shouldest
not eat?

12 And the man said, The woman
whom thou gavest to be with me,
she gave me of the tree, and I did
eat.

13 And the LORD God said unto
the woman, What is this that thou
hast done? And the woman said,
The serpent a beguiled me, and I did
eat.

14 And the LORD God said unto
the a serpent, Because thou hast
done this, thou art b cursed above
all cattle, and above every beast of
the field; upon thy belly shalt thou
go, and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life:

15 And I will put a enmity between
thee and the woman, and between
thy seed and her seed; b it shall
c bruise thy head, and thou shalt
d bruise his heel.

16 Unto the a woman he said, I will
greatly b multiply thy c sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt

17 And unto Adam he said, Because
thou hast hearkened unto the
voice of thy a wife, and hast eaten
of the tree, of which I commanded
thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of
it: b cursed is the ground for thy
sake; in c sorrow shalt thou eat of it

thou eat b bread, till thou return

thou taken: for c dust thou art, and
unto d dust shalt thou return.

20 And Adam called his wife’s
name Eve; because she was the
a mother of all living.

21 Unto Adam also and to his wife
did the LORD God make a coats of
skins, and b clothed them.

22 ¶ And the LORD God a said, Behold,
the b man is become as one of
c us, to d know good and e evil: and
now, lest he put forth his hand, and
take also of the tree of life, and eat,
and live for ever:

23 Therefore the LORD God sent
him forth from the garden of a Eden,
to till the ground from whence he
was taken.

24 So he drove out the man; and
he placed at the east of the garden

of Eden a Cherubims, and a flaming
sword which turned every way, to
keep the way of the b tree of life.

Eve bears Cain and Abel—They offer

AND Adam knew Eve his wife; and
she conceived, and bare a Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the
LORD.

2 And she again bare his brother
Abel. And Abel was a a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the
ground.

3 And in process of time it came
to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto
the LORD.

4 And Abel, he also brought of the
a firstlings of his flock and of the fat
thereof. And the LORD had respect
unto b Abel and to his c offering:
5 But unto a Cain and to his b offering
he had not c respect. And Cain
was very wroth, and his countenance
fell.

6 And the LORD said unto Cain,

thy countenance fallen?

shalt rule over him.

8 And Cain talked with Abel his
brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain
rose up against Abel his brother,
and a slew him.

9 ¶ And the LORD said unto Cain,
Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my a brother’s
b keeper?

10 And he said, What hast thou
done? the voice of thy brother’s
a blood crieth unto me from the
ground.

11 And now art thou a cursed from
the b earth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother’s blood
from thy hand;

12 When thou tillest the ground,
it shall not henceforth yield unto
thee her strength; a a fugitive and a
vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
13 And Cain said unto the LORD,
a My punishment is greater than I
can bear.

14 Behold, thou hast driven me
out this day from the face of the
earth; and from thy face shall I be
hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a
vagabond in the earth; and it shall
come to pass, that every one that
findeth me shall a slay me.

15 And the LORD said unto him,
Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
vengeance shall be taken on him
sevenfold. And the LORD set a a mark
upon Cain, lest any finding him
should kill him.

16 ¶ And Cain went out from the

a presence of the LORD, and dwelt
in the land of Nod, on the east of
b Eden.

17 And Cain knew his a wife; and
she conceived, and bare b Enoch:
and he builded a city, and called
the c name of the city, after the name
of his son, Enoch.

18 And unto Enoch was born
Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael
begat Lamech.

19 ¶ And Lamech took unto him
two wives: the name of the one was
Adah, and the name of the other
Zillah.

20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was
the father of such as dwell in tents,
and of such as have cattle.

21 And his brother’s name was Jubal:
he was the father of all such as
handle the a harp and organ.

22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain,
an a instructer of every b artificer
in c brass and iron: and the sister
of Tubal-cain was Naamah.

23 And Lamech said unto his wives,
Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye
wives of Lamech, hearken unto my
speech: for I have a slain a man to
my wounding, and a young man
to my hurt.

24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
truly a Lamech seventy and
sevenfold.

again; and she bare a son, and called

d made he him;

2 Male and female created he them;
and blessed them, and called their
name a Adam, in the day when they
were created.

3 ¶ And Adam lived an hundred
and thirty years, and begat a son in

hundred years, and begat sons and

saying, This same shall b comfort us
concerning our work and toil of our
hands, because of the ground which
the LORD hath c cursed.

years old: and Noah a begat b Shem,

CHAPTER 6

The sons of God marry the daughters
of men—Men turn to wickedness,
the earth is filled with violence, and
all flesh is corrupted—The Flood is
promised—God establishes His covenant
with Noah, who builds an ark to save
his family and various living things.

AND it came to pass, when men began
to multiply on the face of the
earth, and daughters were born
unto them,

2 That the a sons of God saw the
daughters of men that they were
fair; and they b took them c wives of
all which they chose.

3 And the LORD said, My a spirit
shall not always b strive with man,
for that he also is c flesh: yet his days
shall be an hundred and twenty
years.

4 There were a giants in the earth
in those days; and also after that,
when the sons of God came in unto
the daughters of men, and they bare
children to them, the same became
mighty men which were of old, men
of renown.

5 ¶ And GOD saw that the a wickedness
of man was great in the earth,
and that b every imagination of the
c thoughts of his d heart was only
e evil continually.

6 a And it repented the LORD that
he had made man on the earth, and
it b grieved him at his heart.

7 And the LORD said, I will a destroy
man whom I have created from the
face of the earth; both man, and
beast, and the creeping thing, and
the fowls of the air; bfor it repenteth
me that I have made them.

8 But Noah found a grace in the
eyes of the LORD.

10 And Noah begat three sons,

11 The earth also was a corrupt before
God, and the earth was filled
with b violence.

12 And God looked upon the earth,
and, behold, it was corrupt; for all
a flesh had corrupted his b way upon
the earth.

13 And God said unto Noah, The
end of all flesh is come before me;
for the earth is filled with a violence
through them; and, behold, I will
b destroy them c with the earth.

14 ¶ Make thee an a ark of gopher
wood; b rooms shalt thou make in
the ark, and shalt pitch it within
and without with pitch.

15 And this is the fashion which
thou shalt make it of: The length of
the ark shall be three hundred cubits,
the breadth of it fifty cubits,
and the height of it thirty cubits.
16 A a window shalt thou make to
the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above; and the door of the
ark shalt thou set in the side thereof;
with lower, second, and third stories
shalt thou make it.

17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring
a a flood of b waters upon the earth,
to destroy all flesh, wherein is the
c breath of life, from under heaven;
and every thing that is in the earth
shall die.

18 But with thee will I establish
a my b covenant; and thou shalt come

into the ark, thou, and thy sons,
and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives
with thee.

19 And of every living thing of all
flesh, two of every sort shalt thou
bring into the ark, to keep them
alive with thee; they shall be male
and female.

20 Of fowls after their kind, and
of cattle after their kind, of every
creeping thing of the earth after his
kind, two of every sort shall come
unto thee, to keep them alive.

21 And take thou unto thee of all
food that is eaten, and thou shalt
gather it to thee; and it shall be for
a food for thee, and for them.

22 Thus a did b Noah; according to
all that God c commanded him, so
did he.

CHAPTER 7

Noah’s family and various beasts and
fowl enter the ark—The Flood comes,
and water covers the whole earth—All
other life that breathes is destroyed.
AND the LORD said unto a Noah,
Come thou and all thy house into
the ark; for thee have I seen righteous
before me in this generation.
2 Of every clean beast thou shalt
take to thee by sevens, the male
and his female: and of beasts that
are not clean by two, the male and
his female.

3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens,
the male and the female; to keep seed
alive upon the face of all the earth.

5 And Noah a did according unto
all that the LORD commanded him.
6 And Noah was a six hundred years
old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth.

7 ¶ And Noah went in, and his sons,
and his wife, and his sons’ wives
with him, into the ark, because of
the waters of the flood.

8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts
that are not clean, and of fowls, and
of every thing that creepeth upon
the earth,

9 There went in two and two unto
Noah into the ark, the male and the
female, as God had commanded
Noah.

10 And it came to pass after seven
days, that the waters of the a flood
were upon the earth.

11 ¶ In the six hundredth year of
Noah’s life, in the second month,
the seventeenth day of the month,
the same day were all the a fountains
of the great deep b broken up,
and the c windows of heaven were
opened.

12 And the a rain was upon the
earth forty days and forty nights.
13 In the selfsame day entered
Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
the sons of Noah, and Noah’s
wife, and the three wives of his sons
with them, into the ark;

14 They, and every beast after his
kind, and all the cattle after their
kind, and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his
kind, and every fowl after his kind,
every bird of every sort.

15 And they went in unto Noah

into the ark, two and two of all
flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
16 And they that went in, went
in male and female of all flesh, as
God had commanded him: and the
LORD shut him in.

17 And the flood was forty days
upon the earth; and the waters increased,
and bare up the ark, and
a it was lift up above the earth.

18 And the waters prevailed, and
were increased greatly upon the
earth; and the ark went upon the
face of the waters.

19 And the a waters prevailed exceedingly
upon the earth; and b all
the high hills, that were under the
whole heaven, were covered.

20 Fifteen cubits upward did the
waters prevail; and the mountains
were covered.

21 And all flesh died that moved
upon the earth, both of fowl, and
of cattle, and of beast, and of every
creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth, and a every man:

22 All in whose nostrils was the
a breath of life, of all that was in
the dry land, died.

23 And every living substance was
a destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground, both man, and cattle,
and the creeping things, and the
fowl of the heaven; and they were
destroyed from the earth: and b Noah
only remained c alive, and they that
were with him in the ark.

24 And the waters prevailed upon
the earth an hundred and fifty days.

AND God remembered a Noah, and
every living thing, and all the cattle
that was with him in the ark: and
God made a wind to pass over the
earth, and the waters b assuaged;

2 The a fountains also of the deep
and the windows of heaven were
stopped, and the rain from heaven
was restrained;

3 And the waters a returned from
off the earth continually: and after
the end of the hundred and fifty
days the b waters c were abated.

4 And the ark rested in the seventh
month, on the seventeenth day of
the month, upon the mountains
of Ararat.

5 And the waters decreased continually
until the tenth month: in
the tenth month, on the first day
of the month, were the tops of the
mountains seen.

6 ¶ And it came to pass at the end of
forty days, that Noah opened the window
of the ark which he had made:
7 And he sent forth a raven, which
went forth to and fro, until the waters
were dried up from off the earth.
8 Also he sent forth a dove from
him, to see if the waters were abated
from off the face of the ground;

9 But the dove found no rest for
the sole of her foot, and she returned
unto him into the ark, for
the waters were on the face of the
whole earth: then he put forth his
hand, and took her, and pulled her
in unto him into the ark.

10 And he a stayed yet other seven
days; and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark;

11 And the dove came in to him in
the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
was an olive leaf plucked off: so
Noah knew that the waters were
abated from off the earth.

12 And he stayed yet other seven
days; and sent forth the dove; which
returned not again unto him any
more.

13 ¶ And it came to pass in the a six
hundredth and first year, in the first
month, the first day of the month, the
waters were dried up from off the
earth: and Noah removed the covering
of the ark, and looked, and, behold,
the face of the ground was dry.
14 And in the second month, on
the seven and twentieth day of the
month, was the earth dried.

15 ¶ And God spake unto Noah,
saying,

16 Go forth of the ark, thou, and
thy a wife, and thy sons, and thy
sons’ wives with thee.

17 Bring forth with thee every living
thing that is with thee, of all flesh,
both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every
creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth; that they may breed abundantly
in the earth, and be a fruitful,
and b multiply upon the earth.

18 And Noah went forth, and his
sons, and his wife, and his sons’
wives with him:

CHAPTER 9

Noah and his sons are commanded
to multiply and fill the earth—They
are given dominion over all forms of
life—The death penalty is decreed for
murder—God will not again destroy the
earth by a flood—Canaan is cursed;
Shem and Japheth are blessed.

AND God blessed Noah and his sons,
and said unto them, a Be fruitful,
and b multiply, and c replenish the
earth.

2 And the a fear of you and the
dread of you shall be upon every
beast of the earth, and upon every
fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
upon the earth, and upon all the
fishes of the sea; into your hand are
they delivered.

3 Every moving thing that liveth
shall be a meat for you; even as the
green herb have I given you all
things.

4 a But flesh with the b life thereof,
which is the c blood thereof, shall
ye not eat.

5 And surely a your blood of your
lives will I b require; at the hand of
every beast will I require it, and
at the hand of man; at the hand of
every man’s brother will I require
the life of man.

6 Whoso a sheddeth man’s blood,

by man shall his b blood be shed: for
in the c image of God made he man.
7 And you, be ye a fruitful, and
multiply; bring forth abundantly
in the earth, and multiply therein.
8 ¶ And God spake unto Noah,
and to his sons with him, saying,

9 And I, behold, a I establish my
b covenant with you, and with your
seed after you;

10 And with every living creature
that is with you, of the fowl, of the
cattle, and of every beast of the earth
with you; from all that go out of
the ark, to every beast of the earth.
11 And I will establish my covenant
with you; neither shall all
flesh be cut off any more by the
waters of a flood; neither shall there
any more be a a flood to b destroy the
c earth.

12 And God said, This is the token
of the covenant which I make between
me and you and every living
creature that is with you, for perpetual
generations:

13 I do set my bow in the cloud,
and it shall be for a token of a covenant
between me and the earth.

14 And it shall come to pass, when
I bring a cloud over the earth, that
the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
15 And I will remember my a covenant,
b which is between me and
you and every living creature of all
flesh; and the waters shall no more
become a c flood to destroy all flesh.
16 a And the bow shall be in the
cloud; and I will look upon it, that

upon the earth.

17 And God said unto Noah, This
is the a token of the covenant, which
I have established between me and
all flesh that is upon the earth.
18 ¶ And the a sons of Noah, that
went forth of the ark, were Shem,
and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is
the father of Canaan.

19 These are the three sons of Noah:
and of them was the whole a earth
overspread.

20 And Noah began to be an husbandman,
and he planted a vineyard:
21 And he drank of the wine, and
was drunken; and he was uncovered
within his tent.

22 And Ham, the father of Canaan,
saw the nakedness of his father,
and told his two brethren without.
23 And Shem and Japheth took
a garment, and laid it upon both
their shoulders, and went backward,
and covered the nakedness
of their father; and their faces were
backward, and they saw not their
father’s nakedness.

24 And Noah awoke from his wine,
and knew what his younger son had
done unto him.

25 And he said, a Cursed be b Canaan;
a servant of servants shall
he be unto his brethren.

26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD
God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
his a servant.

27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and
he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
and Canaan shall be his servant.

28 ¶ And Noah lived after the flood
three hundred and fifty years.
29 And all the days of Noah were
nine hundred and fifty years: and
he died.

CHAPTER 10

The descendants of Noah are Japheth,
whose descendants are Gentiles; Ham,
whose descendants include the Canaanites;
and Shem, of whom came
Peleg (in whose days the earth was
divided).

NOW these are the a generations of
the b sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
Japheth: and unto them were sons
born after the flood.

2 The sons of Japheth; a Gomer, and
b Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
Tubal, and c Meshech, and Tiras.
3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz,
and Riphath, and a Togarmah.
4 And the sons of a Javan; b Elishah,
and Tarshish, Kittim, and c Dodanim.
5 a By these were the b isles of the
c Gentiles divided in their d lands; every
one after his tongue, after their
e families, in their nations.

6 ¶ And the sons of a Ham; b Cush,
and c Mizraim, and d Phut, and Canaan.7
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and
Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,
and Sabtecha: and the sons of
Raa mah; Sheba, and Dedan.

8 And Cush begat a Nimrod: he began
to be a mighty one in the earth.
9 He was a mighty hunter before
the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even
as a Nimrod the mighty hunter before
the LORD.

10 And the beginning of his kingdom
was a Babel, and Erech, and
Accad, and Calneh, in the land of
b Shinar.

11 Out of that land went forth Asshur,
and builded Nineveh, and the
city Rehoboth, and Calah,

12 And Resen between Nineveh
and Calah: the same is a great city.
13 And a Mizraim begat Ludim,
and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
Naphtuhim,

14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim,
(out of whom came a Philistim,) and
Caphtorim.

15 ¶ And a Canaan begat Sidon his
firstborn, and Heth,

16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite,
and the Girgasite,

17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite,
and the Sinite,

18 And the Arvadite, and the
Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
afterward were the families of the
a Canaanites spread abroad.

19 And the border of the Canaanites
was from Sidon, as thou comest
to a Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest,
unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and
Admah, and Zeboim, even unto
Lasha.

20 These are the sons of Ham, after
their families, after their tongues, in
their countries, and in their nations.
21 ¶ Unto Shem also, the father
of all the children of a Eber, the
brother of Japheth the elder, even
to him were children born.

22 The children of a Shem; Elam,
and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and
Lud, and Aram.

23 And the children of Aram; a Uz,
and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and
Salah begat Eber.

25 And unto Eber were born two
sons: the name of one was a Peleg;

for in his days was the earth b divided;
and his brother’s name was
Joktan.

26 And Joktan begat Almodad,
and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth,
and Jerah,

27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and
Diklah,

28 And Obal, and Abimael, and
Sheba,

29 And Ophir, and a Havilah, and
Jobab: all these were the sons of
Joktan.

30 And their dwelling was from
Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar
a mount of the east.

31 These are the sons of Shem, after
their families, after their tongues,
in their lands, after their nations.
32 These are the families of the sons
of Noah, after their generations, in
their a nations: and b by these were
the c nations divided in the earth
after the flood.

CHAPTER 11

All men speak the same language—They
build the Tower of Babel—The Lord
confounds their language and scatters
them over all the earth—The generations
of Shem include Abram, whose
wife is Sarai—Abram leaves Ur and
settles in Haran.

AND the whole earth was of one
a language, and of one speech.
2 And it came to pass, as they
journeyed from the east, that they
found a plain in the land of a Shinar;
and they dwelt there.

3 And they said one to another,
Go to, let us make brick, and burn
them throughly. And they had brick
for stone, and a slime had they for
mortar.

4 And they said, Go to, let us build
us a city and a tower, whose top may

reach unto heaven; and let us make

abroad upon the face of the whole
earth.

5 And the LORD came down to see
the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded.

6 And the LORD said, Behold, the
people is one, and they have all one
language; and this they begin to do:
and now nothing will be restrained
from them, which they have imagined
to do.

7 Go to, let us go down, and there
confound their a language, that they
may not understand one another’s
speech.

8 So the LORD scattered them
abroad from thence upon the face
of all the earth: and they left off to
build the acity.

9 Therefore is the name of it called
Babel; because the LORD did there
a confound the b language of all the
earth: and from thence did the LORD
c scatter them d abroad upon the face
of all the earth.

10 ¶ These are the generations of
Shem: Shem was an hundred years
old, and begat Arphaxad two years
after the flood:

11 And Shem lived after he begat
Arphaxad five hundred years, and
begat sons and daughters.

12 And Arphaxad lived five and
thirty years, and begat Salah:
13 And Arphaxad lived after he
begat Salah four hundred and three
years, and begat sons and daughters.
14 And Salah lived thirty years,
and begat Eber:

15 And Salah lived after he begat
Eber four hundred and three years,
and begat sons and daughters.
16 And Eber lived four and thirty
years, and begat a Peleg:

17 And Eber lived after he begat
Peleg four hundred and thirty years,
and begat sons and daughters.
18 And Peleg lived thirty years,
and begat Reu:

19 And Peleg lived after he begat
Reu two hundred and nine years,
and begat sons and daughters.
20 And Reu lived two and thirty
years, and begat Serug:

21 And Reu lived after he begat
Serug two hundred and seven years,
and begat sons and daughters.
22 And Serug lived thirty years,
and begat Nahor:

23 And Serug lived after he begat
Nahor two hundred years, and begat
sons and daughters.

24 And Nahor lived nine and
twenty years, and begat a Terah:
25 And Nahor lived after he begat
Terah an hundred and nineteen
years, and begat sons and daughters.
26 And a Terah lived seventy years,
and begat b Abram, Nahor, and Haran.27
¶ Now these are the generations
of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor,
and Haran; and Haran begat
Lot.

28 And Haran died before his
father Terah in the land of his nativity,
in Ur of the a Chaldees.

29 And Abram and Nahor took
them wives: the name of Abram’s
wife was a Sarai; and the name of
Nahor’s wife, b Milcah, the daughter
of Haran, the father of Milcah, and
the father of Iscah.

30 But Sarai was a barren; she had
no child.

31 And Terah took Abram his son,
and Lot the son of Haran his son’s
son, and Sarai his daughter in law,
his son Abram’s wife; and they went

and they came unto c Haran,
and dwelt there.

32 And the days of Terah were two
hundred and five years: and Terah
died in Haran.

CHAPTER 12

Abram will become a great nation—
He and his seed will bless all the
families of the earth—He travels from
Haran to the land of Canaan—Because
of famine, he goes down into
Egypt—Abram and Sarai are tested in
Pharaoh’s court.

NOW the LORD had a said unto
b Abram, c Get thee out of thy d country,
and from thy e kindred, and from
thy f father’s house, unto a g land that
I will shew thee:

2 And I will make of thee a a great
b nation, and I will c bless thee, and
make thy d name great; and thou
shalt be a blessing:

3 And I will a bless them that bless
thee, and b curse him that c curseth
thee: and in thee shall all d families
of the earth be e blessed.

4 So Abram departed, as the LORD
had spoken unto him; and Lot went
with him: and Abram was a seventy
and five years old when he departed
out of Haran.

5 And Abram took a Sarai his wife,
and b Lot his c brother’s son, and all

their substance that they had gathered,
and the souls that they had
d gotten in e Haran; and they went
forth to go into the land of Canaan;
and into the land of Canaan they
came.

6 ¶ And Abram passed through
the land unto the place of Sichem,
unto the plain of Moreh. And the
a Canaanite was then in the land.
7 And the LORD appeared unto
Abram, and said, a Unto thy b seed
will I give this c land: and there
builded he an d altar unto the LORD,
who appeared unto him.

8 And he removed from thence
unto a mountain on the east of
a Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having
b Beth-el on the west, and c Hai
on the east: and there he builded
an altar unto the LORD, and d called
upon the e name of the LORD.

9 And Abram journeyed, going on
still toward the south.

10 ¶ And there was a a famine in
the land: and Abram went down
into Egypt to sojourn there; for the
famine was grievous in the land.
11 And it came to pass, when he
was come near to enter into Egypt,
that he a said unto Sarai his wife,
Behold now, I know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon:

12 Therefore it shall come to pass,
when the Egyptians shall see thee,
that they shall say, This is his wife:

14 ¶ And it came to pass, that,
when Abram was come into Egypt,
the Egyptians a beheld the woman
that she was very fair.

15 The princes also of Pharaoh
saw her, and commended her before
Pharaoh: and the woman was
taken into Pharaoh’s house.

16 And he entreated Abram well
for her sake: and he had sheep,
and oxen, and he asses, and menservants,
and maidservants, and
she asses, and camels.

17 And the LORD a plagued Pharaoh
and his house with great b plagues
because of Sarai Abram’s wife.

18 And Pharaoh called Abram,
and said, What is this that thou hast
a done unto me? why didst thou not
tell me that she was thy wife?

19 Why saidst thou, She is my a sister?
so I might have taken her to
me to wife: now therefore behold
thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20 And Pharaoh commanded his
men concerning him: and they
sent him away, and his wife, and
all that he had.

CHAPTER 13

Abram returns from Egypt—He and
Lot part—The Lord will make Abram’s
seed as the dust of the earth in number—Abram
settles in Hebron.

AND Abram went up out of Egypt,
he, and his wife, and all that he had,
and Lot with him, into the south.
2 And Abram was very a rich in
cattle, in silver, and in gold.

3 And he went on his journeys
from the south even to a Beth-el, unto
the place where his tent had been
at the beginning, between Beth-el
and b Hai;

4 Unto the place of the a altar,
which he had made there at the
first: and there Abram b called on the
name of the LORD.

5 ¶ And Lot also, which went with
Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
tents.

6 And the land was not able to
bear them, that they might dwell
together: for their substance was
great, so that they could not dwell
together.

7 And there was a strife between
the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and
the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the
a Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled
then in the land.

8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let
there be no a strife, I pray thee, between
me and thee, and between
my herdmen and thy herdmen; for
we be b brethren.

9 Is not the whole land before thee?
separate thyself, I pray thee, from
me: if thou wilt take the left hand,
then I will go to the right; or if thou
depart to the right hand, then I will
go to the left.

10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and
beheld all the plain of Jordan, that
it was well watered every where,
before the LORD destroyed a Sodom
and Gomorrah, even as the garden
of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,
as thou comest unto b Zoar.

11 Then Lot chose him all the plain
of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east:
and they separated themselves the
one from the other.

cities of the plain, and pitched his
tent toward Sodom.

13 But the men of a Sodom were
b wicked and sinners before the
LORD exceedingly.

14 ¶ And the LORD said unto
Abram, after that Lot was separated
from him, Lift up now thine eyes,
and look from the place where thou
art northward, and southward, and
eastward, and a westward:

15 For all the a land which thou
seest, to thee will I give it, and to
thy seed for ever.

16 And I will make thy a seed as the
b dust of the earth: so that if a man
can number the dust of the earth,
then shall thy seed also be numbered.
17 Arise, walk through the land in
the length of it and in the breadth
of it; for I will give it unto thee.

18 Then Abram removed his tent,
and came and dwelt a in the plain
of Mamre, which is in b Hebron, and
built there an c altar unto the LORD.

CHAPTER 14

Lot is captured in the battles of the
kings—He is rescued by Abram—
Melchizedek administers bread and
wine and blesses Abram—Abram pays
tithes—He declines to accept the spoils
of conquest.

AND it came to pass in the days of
Amraphel king of a Shinar, Arioch
king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king
of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2 That these made war with Bera
king of Sodom, and with Birsha king
of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah,
and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and
the king of Bela, which is a Zoar.

3 All these were joined together

in the vale of Siddim, which is the
a salt sea.

4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer,
and in the thirteenth
year they rebelled.

5 And in the fourteenth year came
Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
were with him, and smote the
a Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim,
and the b Zuzims in Ham, and the
c Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

6 And the a Horites in their mount
Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the
wilderness.

7 And they returned, and came to
En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and
smote all the country of the Amalekites,
and also the Amorites, that
dwelt in Hazezon-tamar.

8 And there went out the king of
Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,
and the king of Admah, and the king
of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the
same is Zoar;) and they joined battle
with them in the vale of Siddim;
9 With Chedorlaomer the king of
Elam, and with Tidal king of nations,
and Amraphel king of Shinar,
and Arioch king of Ellasar; four
kings with five.

10 And the vale of Siddim was
full of a slimepits; and the kings of
Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell
there; and they that remained fled
to the mountain.

11 And they took all the goods of
Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
victuals, and went their way.

12 And they took a Lot, Abram’s
brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom,
and his goods, and departed.

14 And when Abram heard that his

house, three hundred and eighteen,
and pursued them unto Dan.

15 And he divided himself against

unto Hobah, which is on the a left

16 And he brought back all the

a brother Lot, and his goods, and the
women also, and the people.

17 ¶ And the king of Sodom went
out to meet him after his return
from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer,
and of the kings that were with him,
at the valley of Shaveh, which is the
a king’s dale.

18 And a Melchizedek king of b Salem
brought forth c bread and wine:

God, which hath delivered thine enemies
into thy hand. And he gave
him b tithes of all.

21 And the king of Sodom said
unto Abram, Give me the persons,
and take the a goods to thyself.

22 And Abram said to the king of
Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
unto the LORD, the most high God,
the possessor of heaven and earth,

23 That I will not take from a
thread even to a shoelatchet, and
that I will not take any thing that
is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I
have made Abram a rich:

24 Save only that which the young
men have eaten, and the portion of
the men which went with me, Aner,
Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take
their a portion.

CHAPTER 15

Abram desires offspring—The Lord
promises him seed in number as the
stars—Abram believes the promise—
His seed will be strangers in Egypt—
Then, after four generations, they will
inherit Canaan.

AFTER these things the word of
the LORD came unto Abram in a
a vision, saying, b Fear not, Abram:
I am thy c shield, and thy exceeding
great reward.

2 And Abram said, Lord GOD, what
wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless,
and the a steward of my house
is this Eliezer of Damascus?

3 And Abram said, Behold, to me
thou hast given no seed: and, lo,
a one born in my house is mine heir.
4 And, behold, the word of the
LORD came unto him, saying, This
shall not be thine heir; but he that
shall come forth out of thine own
bowels shall be thine heir.

5 And he brought him forth abroad,
and said, Look now toward heaven,
and a tell the b stars, if thou be able

and he counted it to him for c righteousness.7
And he said unto him, I am the
LORD that brought thee out of Ur
of the Chaldees, to give thee this
land to a inherit it.

8 And he said, Lord GOD, whereby
shall I a know that I shall inherit it?
9 And he said unto him, Take me
an heifer of three years old, and a
she goat of three years old, and a
ram of three years old, and a turtledove,
and a young pigeon.

10 And he took unto him all these,
and a divided them in the midst, and
laid each piece one against another:
but the birds divided he not.

11 And when the fowls came down
upon the carcases, Abram drove
them away.

12 And when the sun was going
down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and, lo, an horror of great a darkness
fell upon him.

13 And he said unto Abram, Know
of a surety that thy seed shall be a
a stranger in a land that is not theirs,
and shall serve them; and they shall
b afflict them four hundred years;
14 And also that nation, whom
they shall serve, will I judge: and
afterward shall they a come out with

15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers
in peace; thou shalt be buried in a

16 But in the a fourth generation
they shall come b hither again: for

17 And it came to pass, that, when
the sun went down, and it was dark,
behold a smoking furnace, and a
burning lamp that a passed between
those pieces.

18 In the same day the LORD made
a a covenant with Abram, saying,
Unto thy seed have I given this
b land, from c the river of Egypt unto
the great river, the river d Euphrates:
19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites,
and the Kadmonites,

4 ¶ And he went in unto Hagar,
and she conceived: and when she
saw that she had conceived, her
mistress was despised in her eyes.
5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My

she saw that she had conceived, I
was a despised in her eyes: the LORD
judge between me and thee.

6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold,

her a as it pleaseth thee. And when

from her face.

7 ¶ And the angel of the LORD
found her by a fountain of water
in the wilderness, by the fountain
in the way to a Shur.

8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid,
whence camest thou? and whither
wilt thou go? And she said, I flee
from the face of my mistress Sarai.

unto her, Return to thy mistress, and

10 And the angel of the LORD said
unto her, I will multiply thy a seed
exceedingly, that it shall not be
numbered for multitude.

11 And the angel of the LORD said
unto her, Behold, thou art with child,
and shalt bear a son, and shalt call
his name a Ishmael; because the LORD
hath heard thy affliction.

12 And he will be a a wild man; his
hand will be against every man, and
every man’s hand against him; and
he shall dwell in the presence of all

13 And she called the name of the
LORD that spake unto her, Thou God
seest me: for she said, Have I also
here looked after him that seeth me?

and Abram called his son’s name,
which Hagar bare, b Ishmael.

16 And Abram was fourscore and
six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael
to Abram.

Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
thou, and thy seed after thee
in their generations.

10 This is my a covenant, which ye
shall keep, between me and you and
thy seed after thee; Every man child
among you shall be b circumcised.
11 And ye shall a circumcise the
flesh of your foreskin; and it shall
be a b token of the c covenant betwixt

12 And he that is a eight days old
shall be circumcised among you,
every man child in your generations,
he that is born in the house,
or b bought with money of any
stranger, which is not of thy seed.
13 He that is born in thy house, and
he that is bought with thy money,

must needs be circumcised: and my
covenant shall be in your flesh for
an a everlasting covenant.

14 And the uncircumcised man
child whose flesh of his foreskin is
not circumcised, that soul shall be
a cut off from his people; he hath
broken my covenant.

As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
call her name Sarai, but a Sarah shall
her name be.

16 And I will bless her, and a give
thee a son also of her: yea, I will
bless her, and she shall be a b mother

face, and b laughed, and said in his
heart, Shall a child be born unto
him that is an c hundred years old?
and shall Sarah, that is ninety years
old, bear?

that a Ishmael might live before thee!
19 And God said, a Sarah thy wife
shall bear thee a son indeed; and
thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I
will establish my b covenant with
him for an everlasting covenant,
and with his seed after him.

20 And as for a Ishmael, I have
heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
him, and will make him fruitful,
and will multiply him exceedingly;

I will make him a great nation.

circumcised, and Ishmael his

looked, and, lo, three a men stood
by him: and when he saw them, he
ran to meet them from the tent
door, and b bowed himself toward
the ground,

3 And said, My a Lord, if now I have
found favour in thy sight, pass not
away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

4 Let a little water, I pray you, be
fetched, and a wash your feet, and
b rest yourselves under the tree:

5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread,
and a comfort ye your hearts; after
that ye shall pass on: for therefore
are ye b come to your servant. And
they said, So do, as thou hast said.
6 And Abraham hastened into the
tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
ready quickly three measures of
fine meal, knead it, and make cakes
upon the hearth.

7 And Abraham ran unto the herd,
and fetcht a calf tender and good,
and gave it unto a young man; and
he hasted to dress it.

8 And he took butter, and milk,
and the calf which he had dressed,
and set it before them; and he stood
by them under the tree, and they
did eat.

9 ¶ And they said unto him, Where
is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,
in the tent.

10 And he said, I will certainly
return unto thee according to the
time of life; and, lo, a Sarah thy wife
shall have a b son. And Sarah heard
it in the tent door, which was behind
him.

11 Now Abraham and Sarah were
a old and well stricken in age; and it
b ceased to be with Sarah after the
manner of women.

12 Therefore Sarah laughed within
herself, saying, After I am waxed
old shall I have pleasure, my lord
being a old also?

13 And the LORD said unto Abraham,
Wherefore did Sarah a laugh,
saying, Shall I of a surety bear a
child, which am b old?

14 Is any thing too a hard for the
LORD? At the time appointed I will
return unto thee, according to the

15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I

he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
16 ¶ And the men rose up from
thence, and looked toward Sodom:
and Abraham went with them to
bring them on the way.

17 And the LORD said, Shall I a hide
from Abraham that thing which I do;
18 Seeing that Abraham shall
surely become a great and mighty
a nation, and all the b nations of the
earth shall be c blessed in him?

19 For I a know him, that he will
b command his c children and his
d household after him, and they
shall e keep the way of the LORD, to
do justice and f judgment; that the
LORD may bring upon Abraham
that which he hath spoken of him.
20 And the LORD said, Because
the a cry of Sodom and Gomorrah
is great, and because their b sin is
very grievous;

21 I will go down now, and see
whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it, which
is come unto me; and if not, I will
a know.

22 a And the men turned their
faces from thence, and went toward
Sodom: but Abraham b stood
yet before the LORD.

23 ¶ And Abraham drew near, and
said, Wilt thou also a destroy the
b righteous with the c wicked?

24 Peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city: wilt thou

also destroy and not a spare the
place for the fifty righteous that
are therein?

25 That be far from thee to do
after this manner, to slay the righteous
with the wicked: and that the
righteous should be as the wicked,
that be far from thee: Shall not the
a Judge of all the earth do right?

26 And the LORD said, If I find in
Sodom fifty a righteous within the
city, then I will spare all the place
for their sakes.

27 And Abraham answered and
said, Behold now, I have taken upon
me to speak unto the Lord, which
am but a dust and ashes:

28 Peradventure there shall lack
five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou
destroy all the city for lack of five?
And he said, If I find there forty
and five, I will not destroy it.

29 And he spake unto him yet
again, and said, Peradventure there
shall be forty found there. And he
said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.
30 And he said unto him, Oh let not
the Lord be angry, and I will speak:
Peradventure there shall thirty be
found there. And he said, I will not
do it, if I find thirty there.

31 And he said, Behold now, I have
taken upon me to speak unto the
Lord: Peradventure there shall be
twenty found there. And he said,
I will not destroy it for twenty’s
sake.

32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord
be a angry, and I will speak yet but
this once: Peradventure ten shall be

CHAPTER 19

Lot entertains holy men—The men
of Sodom seek to abuse Lot’s guests
and are smitten with blindness—Lot
is sent out of Sodom—The Lord rains
brimstone and fire upon Sodom and
Gomorrah—Lot’s daughters preserve
his seed in the land.

AND there came a two b angels to
Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them
rose up to meet them; and he bowed
himself with his face toward the
ground;

2 And he said, Behold now, my
lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
servant’s house, and tarry all night,
and a wash your feet, and ye shall
rise up early, and go on your ways.
And they said, Nay; but we will
abide in the street all night.

3 And he pressed upon them
greatly; and they turned in unto him,
and entered into his house; and he
made them a a feast, and did bake
b unleavened bread, and they did eat.

4 ¶ But before they lay down, the
men of the city, even the men of
Sodom, compassed the house round,
both old and young, all the people
from every quarter:

5 And they called unto Lot, and
said unto him, Where are the men
which came in to thee this night?
bring them out unto us, that we
may a know them.

6 And Lot went out at the door unto
them, and shut the door after him,

7 And said, I pray you, brethren,
do not so wickedly.

8 a Behold now, I have two b daughters
which have not known man; let
me, I pray you, bring them out unto
you, and do ye to them as is good in
your eyes: only unto these men do
nothing; for therefore c came they
under the shadow of my roof.

9 And they said, Stand back. And
they said again, This one fellow came
in to a sojourn, and he will needs
be a judge: now will we deal worse
with thee, than with them. And
they pressed sore upon the man,
even Lot, and came near to break the
door.

10 But the men put forth their
hand, and pulled Lot into the house
to them, and shut to the door.

11 And they smote the men that
were at the door of the house with
a blindness, both small and great:
so that they wearied themselves to
find the door.

12 ¶ And a the men said unto Lot,
Hast thou here any besides? son in
law, and thy sons, and thy daughters,
and whatsoever thou hast in the
city, b bring them out of this place:

13 For we will destroy this place,
because the a cry of them is waxen
great before the face of the LORD;
and the LORD hath sent us to destroy
it.

14 And Lot went out, and spake
unto his sons in law, which married
his daughters, and said, Up,
a get you b out of this place; for the
LORD will destroy this city. But he
seemed as one that c mocked unto
his sons in law.

15 ¶ And when the morning arose,
then the a angels hastened b Lot, saying,
Arise, take thy wife, and thy
two daughters, which are here; lest
thou be consumed in the iniquity
of the city.

16 And while he lingered, the men
laid hold upon his hand, and upon
the hand of his wife, and upon the
hand of his two daughters; the LORD
being a merciful unto him: and they
brought him forth, and set him
without the city.

17 ¶ And it came to pass, when
they had brought them forth abroad,
that he said, Escape for thy life;
a look not behind thee, neither stay
thou in all the plain; escape to the
b mountain, lest thou be consumed.
18 And Lot said unto them, Oh,
not so, my Lord:

19 Behold now, thy servant hath
found a grace in thy sight, and thou
hast magnified thy mercy, which
thou hast shewed unto me in saving
my life; and I cannot escape to
the mountain, lest some evil take
me, and I die:

20 Behold now, this city is near to
flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh,
let me escape thither, (is it not a
little one?) and my soul shall live.
21 And he said unto him, See, I
have a accepted thee concerning
this thing also, that I will not overthrow
this city, for the which thou
hast spoken.

22 Haste thee, escape thither; for
I cannot do any thing till thou be
come thither. Therefore the name
of the city was called a Zoar.

23 ¶ The sun was risen upon the
earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

24 Then the LORD rained upon
a Sodom and upon b Gomorrah c brimstone
and fire from the LORD out
of heaven;

25 And he overthrew those cities,
and all the plain, and all the inhabitants
of the cities, and that which
grew upon the ground.

26 ¶ But his wife a looked back
from behind him, and she became
a b pillar of salt.

27 ¶ And Abraham gat up early
in the morning to the place where
he stood before the LORD:

28 And he looked toward Sodom
and Gomorrah, and toward all the
land of the plain, and beheld, and,
lo, the a smoke of the country went
up as the smoke of a furnace.

29 ¶ And it came to pass, when
God destroyed the cities of the
plain, that God remembered Abraham,
and sent Lot out of the midst
of the overthrow, when he overthrew
the cities in the which Lot
dwelt.

30 ¶ And Lot went up out of Zoar,
and dwelt in the a mountain, and
his two daughters with him; for
he feared to dwell in Zoar: and
he dwelt in a cave, he and his two
daughters.

31 And the a firstborn said unto
the younger, Our father is old, and
there is not a man in the earth to
come in unto us after the manner
of all the earth:

32 Come, let us make our father
drink wine, and we will lie with
him, that we may preserve seed of
our father.

drink wine that night: and the

of Lot with child by their father.

unto this day.

CHAPTER 20

Abimelech desires Sarah, who is preserved
by the Lord—Abraham prays
for Abimelech, and the Lord blesses
him and his household.

AND Abraham journeyed from
thence toward the south country,
and dwelled between Kadesh and
a Shur, and sojourned in b Gerar.

2 And Abraham said of Sarah his
wife, She is my sister: and a Abimelech
king of Gerar sent, and
took Sarah.

3 But a God came to Abimelech in
a dream by night, and said to him,
Behold, thou art but a dead man, for
the woman which thou hast taken;
for she is a man’s wife.

4 But Abimelech had not come

near her: and he said, Lord, wilt
thou slay also a a righteous nation?

5 Said he not unto me, She is my
a sister? and she, even she herself
said, He is my b brother: in the c integrity
of my heart and innocency
of my hands have I done this.

6 And God said unto him in a
dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy heart;
for I also withheld thee from sinning
against me: therefore suffered
I thee not to touch her.

7 Now therefore restore the man
his wife; for he is a prophet, and he
shall a pray for thee, and thou shalt
live: and if thou restore her not,
know thou that thou shalt surely
die, thou, and all that are thine.

8 Therefore Abimelech rose early
in the morning, and called all his
servants, and told all these things
in their ears: and the men were
sore afraid.

9 Then a Abimelech called Abraham,
and said unto him, What
hast thou b done unto us? and what
have I offended thee, that thou hast
brought on me and on my kingdom
a great sin? thou hast c done deeds
unto me that ought not to be done.
10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham,
What sawest thou, that thou
hast done this thing?

11 And Abraham said, Because I
thought, Surely the a fear of God is
not in this place; and they will slay
me for my wife’s sake.

12 And yet indeed she is my a sister;
she is the daughter of my father,
but not the daughter of my mother;
and she became my wife.

13 And it came to pass, when God
caused me to a wander from my
father’s house, that I said unto her,

14 And Abimelech took sheep,
and oxen, and menservants, and
womenservants, and gave them unto
Abraham, and restored him Sarah
his wife.

15 And Abimelech said, Behold,
my a land is before thee: dwell where
it pleaseth thee.

16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold,
I have given thy a brother a thousand
pieces of silver: behold, he is
to thee a covering of the eyes, unto
all that are with thee, and with all
other: thus she was reproved.

17 ¶ So Abraham prayed unto
God: and God healed Abimelech,
and his wife, and his maidservants;
and they bare children.

18 For the LORD had fast a closed
up all the wombs of the house
of Abimelech, because of Sarah
Abraham’s wife.

CHAPTER 21

Sarah bears Isaac—He is circumcised
—Hagar and her son are cast out
of Abraham’s household—The Lord
saves Hagar and Ishmael—Abraham
and Abimelech deal honorably with
each other.

AND the LORD a visited Sarah as he
had said, and the LORD did unto
b Sarah as he had spoken.

2 For Sarah conceived, and bare
Abraham a a son in his b old age, at
the set c time of which God had spoken
to him.

3 And Abraham called the name
of his a son that was born unto

him, whom Sarah bare to him,
Isaac.

4 And Abraham a circumcised his
son Isaac being eight days old, as
God had commanded him.

5 And Abraham was an a hundred
years old, when his son Isaac was
born unto him.

6 ¶ And Sarah said, God hath made
me to a laugh, so that all that hear
will laugh with me.

7 And she said, Who would have
said unto Abraham, that Sarah
should have given children suck? for
I have born him a son in his a old age.
8 And the child grew, and was
weaned: and Abraham made a great
feast the same day that Isaac was
weaned.

9 ¶ And Sarah saw the son of a Hagar
the Egyptian, which she had
b born unto Abraham, c mocking.

10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham,
a Cast out this bondwoman and
her son: for the son of this bondwoman
shall not be b heir with my
son, even with Isaac.

11 And the thing was very grievous
in Abraham’s sight because of
his a son.

12 ¶ And God said unto Abraham,
Let it not be grievous in thy sight
because of the lad, and because of
thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah
hath said unto thee, hearken unto
her voice; for in a Isaac shall thy
b seed be called.

13 And also of the son of the bondwoman
will I make a a nation, because
he is thy seed.

Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,
and the child, and a sent her away:
and she departed, and wandered
in the wilderness of b Beer-sheba.

15 And the water was spent in the
bottle, and she cast the child under
one of the shrubs.

16 And she went, and sat her down
over against him a good way off, as
it were a bowshot: for she said, Let
me not see the death of the child.
And she sat over against him, and
lift up her voice, and wept.

17 And God heard the voice of the
lad; and the a angel of God called to
Hagar out of heaven, and said unto
her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear
not; for God hath heard the voice
of the lad where he is.

18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold
him in thine hand; for I will make
him a great a nation.

19 And God a opened her eyes, and
she saw a well of water; and she
went, and filled the bottle with water,
and gave the lad drink.

20 And God was with the lad; and
he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
and became an a archer.

nor with my son’s son: but according
to the kindness that I have done
unto thee, thou shalt do unto me,
and to the land wherein thou hast
sojourned.

24 And Abraham said, I will swear.

25 And Abraham a reproved Abimelech
because of a well of water,
which Abimelech’s servants b had
violently taken away.

26 And Abimelech said, I wot not
who hath done this thing: neither
didst thou tell me, neither yet heard
I of it, but to day.

27 And Abraham took sheep and
oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
and both of them a made a
covenant.

28 And Abraham set seven ewe
lambs of the flock by themselves.
29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham,
What mean these seven ewe
lambs which thou hast set by themselves?30
And he said, For these seven ewe
lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
that they may be a witness unto
me, that I have digged this a well.

31 Wherefore he called that place
a Beer-sheba; because there they
sware both of them.

32 Thus they made a covenant at
Beer-sheba: a then Abimelech rose
up, and Phichol the chief captain
of his host, and they returned into
the land of the Philistines.

33 ¶ And Abraham planted a a grove
in Beer-sheba, and b called there on
the name of the LORD, the c everlasting
God.

34 And Abraham sojourned in the
a Philistines’ land many days.

things, that God did a tempt Abraham,
and said unto him, Abraham:
and he said, Behold, here I am.

2 And he said, a Take now thy son,
thine b only son Isaac, whom thou
c lovest, and get thee into the land of
d Moriah; and offer him there for
a burnt offering upon one of the
mountains which I will tell thee of.
3 ¶ And Abraham rose up early in
the morning, and saddled his ass,
and took two of his young men with
him, and Isaac his son, and clave the
a wood for the burnt offering, and
rose up, and went unto the place
of which God had told him.

4 Then on the third day Abraham
lifted up his eyes, and saw the place
afar off.

5 And Abraham said unto his
young men, Abide ye here with
the ass; and I and the lad will go
yonder and a worship, and come
again to you.

6 And Abraham took the wood of
the burnt offering, and a laid it upon
Isaac his son; and he took the fire in
his hand, and a knife; and they went
both of them together.

7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham
his father, and said, My father: and
he said, a Here am I, my son. And he
said, Behold the fire and the wood:
but where is the lamb for a burnt
offering?

8 And Abraham said, My son, God
will provide himself a a lamb for a
burnt offering: so they went both of
them together.

9 And they came to the place
which God had told him of; and
Abraham built an altar there, and

a laid the wood in order, and bound
Isaac his son, and laid him on the
b altar upon the wood.

10 And Abraham stretched forth
his hand, and took the knife to slay
his son.

11 And the angel of the LORD called
unto him out of heaven, and said,
Abraham, Abraham: and he said,
Here am I.

12 And he said, a Lay not thine
hand upon the lad, neither do thou
any thing unto him: for now I know
that thou b fearest God, seeing thou
hast not c withheld thy son, thine
only son from me.

13 And Abraham lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket
by his horns: and Abraham went
and took the ram, and offered him
up for a burnt offering in the stead
of his son.

14 And Abraham called the name
of that place a Jehovah-jireh: as it is
said to this day, b In the mount of
the LORD it shall be seen.

15 ¶ And the angel of the LORD
called unto Abraham out of heaven
the second time,

16 And said, By myself have I
a sworn, saith the LORD, for because
thou hast done this thing, and hast
not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17 That in blessing I will bless thee,
and in multiplying I will multiply

because thou hast c obeyed my

19 So Abraham returned unto his
young men, and they rose up and
went together to Beer-sheba; and
Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.

20 ¶ And it came to pass after
these things, that it was told Abraham,
saying, Behold, a Milcah, she
hath also born children unto thy
brother Nahor;

21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his
brother, and Kemuel the father of
Aram,

22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and

24 And his concubine, whose

and Maachah.

CHAPTER 23

Sarah dies and is buried in the cave of
Machpelah, which Abraham buys from
Ephron the Hittite.

AND Sarah was an hundred and
seven and twenty years old: these
were the years of the life of Sarah.
2 And Sarah a died in Kirjath-arba;
the same is b Hebron in the land
of Canaan: and Abraham came to
mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
3 ¶ And Abraham stood up from
before his dead, and spake unto the
sons of Heth, saying,

4 I am a a stranger and a sojourner
with you: give me a possession of a
buryingplace with you, that I may
bury my b dead out of my sight.

5 And the children of Heth answered
Abraham, saying unto him,
6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a a
mighty prince among us: in the
choice of our sepulchres bury thy

dead; none of us shall withhold
from thee his sepulchre, but that
thou mayest bury thy dead.

7 And Abraham stood up, and
bowed himself to the people of the
land, even to the children of Heth.
8 And he communed with them,
saying, If it be your mind that I
should bury my dead out of my
sight; hear me, and entreat for me
to Ephron the son of Zohar,

9 That he may give me the cave of
a Machpelah, which he hath, which is
in the end of his field; for as much
money as it is worth he shall give
it me for a possession of a buryingplace
amongst you.

10 And Ephron dwelt among the
children of Heth: and Ephron the
Hittite answered Abraham in the
audience of the children of Heth,
even of all that went in at the a gate
of his city, saying,

11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field
give I thee, and the cave that is
therein, I give it thee; in the presence
of the sons of my people give
I it thee: bury thy dead.

12 And Abraham bowed down himself
before the people of the land.
13 And he spake unto Ephron in
the audience of the people of the
land, saying, But if thou wilt give
it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give
thee money for the field; take it of
me, and I will bury my dead there.
14 And Ephron answered Abraham,
saying unto him,

15 My lord, hearken unto me: the
land is worth four hundred a shekels
of silver; what is that betwixt me
and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16 And Abraham hearkened unto
a Ephron; and Abraham b weighed to
c Ephron the silver, which he had
named in the audience of the sons of
Heth, four hundred shekels of silver,
current money with the merchant.

that were in all the borders round
about, were made sure

18 Unto Abraham for a possession
in the presence of the children of

gate of his city.

19 And after this, Abraham buried
Sarah his wife in the cave of the
field of Machpelah before Mamre:
the same is a Hebron in the land of
Canaan.

20 And the field, and the cave
that is therein, were made sure
unto Abraham for a possession of a
buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

CHAPTER 24

Abraham commands that Isaac shall
not marry a Canaanite—The Lord
guides Abraham’s servant in choosing
Rebekah as a wife for Isaac—Rebekah
is blessed to be the mother of thousands
of millions—She marries Isaac.

AND Abraham was old, and well
a stricken in age: and the LORD had
b blessed Abraham in all c things.

2 And Abraham said unto his eldest
a servant of his house, that ruled
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee,
thy hand under my b thigh:

3 And I will make thee a swear by
the LORD, the God of heaven, and
the God of the earth, that thou shalt
b not take a c wife unto my son of
the daughters of the d Canaanites,
among whom I dwell:

4 But thou shalt go unto my

a country, and to my b kindred, and
take a wife unto my son Isaac.

5 And the servant said unto him,
a Peradventure the woman will not
be willing to follow me unto this
land: must I needs bring thy son
again unto the land from whence
thou camest?

6 And Abraham said unto him,
Beware thou that thou bring not
my son thither again.

7 ¶ The a LORD God of heaven,
which took me from my b father’s
house, and from the land of my kindred,
and which spake unto me, and
that sware unto me, saying, Unto
thy seed will I give this c land; he
shall send his d angel before thee,
and thou shalt take a wife unto my
son from thence.

8 And if the woman will not be
willing to follow thee, then thou
shalt be clear from this my oath:
only bring not my son thither again.
9 And the servant put his hand
under the a thigh of Abraham his
master, and sware to him concerning
that matter.

10 ¶ And the servant took ten
camels of the camels of his master,
and departed; for all the goods of
his master were in his hand: and he
arose, and went to a Mesopotamia,
unto the city of b Nahor.

11 And he made his camels to kneel
down without the city by a well of
water at the time of the evening,
even the time that women go out
to draw water.

12 And he said, O a LORD God of my
master Abraham, I pray thee, b send
me good speed this day, and shew
kindness unto my master Abraham.

13 Behold, I stand here by the well
of water; and the daughters of the
men of the city come out to draw
a water:

14 And let it come to pass, that the
damsel to whom I shall say, Let down
thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may
drink; and she shall say, Drink, and
I will give thy camels drink also: let
the same be she that thou hast a appointed
for thy servant Isaac; and
thereby shall I know that thou hast
shewed kindness unto my master.
15 ¶ And it came to pass, before
he had done speaking, that, behold,
Rebekah came out, who was born to
a Bethuel, son of b Milcah, the wife
of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with
her pitcher upon her shoulder.

16 And the damsel was very a fair
to look upon, a virgin, neither had
any man b known her: and she went
down to the well, and filled her
pitcher, and came up.

17 And the servant ran to meet
her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
drink a little water of thy pitcher.
18 And she said, Drink, my lord:
and she hasted, and let down her
pitcher upon her hand, and gave
him drink.

19 And when she had done giving
him drink, she said, I will draw water
for thy camels also, until they
have done drinking.

20 And she hasted, and emptied
her pitcher into the trough, and ran
again unto the well to draw water,
and drew for all his camels.

21 And the man wondering at her
held his peace, to wit whether the
LORD had made his journey a prosperous
or not.

22 And it came to pass, as the
camels had done drinking, that the
man took a golden a earring of half
a shekel weight, and two bracelets

for her hands of ten shekels weight
of gold;

23 And said, Whose daughter art
thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there
room in thy father’s house for us
to lodge in?

24 And she said unto him, I am
the daughter of Bethuel the son
of Milcah, which she bare unto
a Nahor.

25 She said moreover unto him,
We have both straw and provender
enough, and room to lodge in.

26 And the man a bowed down his
head, and worshipped the LORD.

27 And he said, Blessed be the
a LORD God of my master Abraham,
who hath not left destitute my master
of his b mercy and his truth: I being
in the way, the LORD c led me to
the house of my master’s brethren.
28 And the damsel ran, and told
them of her mother’s house these
things.

29 ¶ And Rebekah had a brother,
and his name was Laban: and a Laban
ran out unto the man, unto the well.
30 And it came to pass, when
he saw the earring and bracelets
upon his sister’s hands, and when
he heard the words of Rebekah his
sister, saying, Thus spake the man
unto me; that he came unto the
man; and, behold, he stood by the
camels at the well.

31 And he said, Come in, thou
a blessed of the LORD; wherefore
standest thou without? for I have
prepared the house, and room for
the camels.

32 ¶ And the man came into the
house: and he ungirded his camels,
and gave straw and a provender for
the camels, and water to b wash his
feet, and the men’s feet that were
with him.

him to eat: but he said, I will not

And he said, Speak on.

34 And he said, I am Abraham’s
servant.

35 And the LORD hath a blessed my
master greatly; and he is become
b great: and he hath given him flocks,
and herds, and silver, and gold, and
menservants, and maidservants,
and camels, and asses.

36 And Sarah my master’s wife
bare a a son to my master when she
was b old: and unto him hath he
c given all that he hath.

37 And my master made me a swear,
saying, Thou shalt not take a wife
to my son of the daughters of the
Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
38 But thou shalt go unto my
a father’s house, and to my kindred,
and take a wife unto my son.

39 And I said unto my master,
a Peradventure the woman will not
follow me.

40 And he said unto me, The a LORD,
before whom I b walk, will send his
angel with thee, and prosper thy
way; and thou shalt take a wife for
my son of my kindred, and of my
father’s house:

41 Then shalt thou be clear from
this my oath, when thou comest to
my kindred; and if they give not
thee one, thou shalt be clear from
my oath.

42 And I came this day unto the
well, and said, O LORD God of my
master Abraham, if now thou do
prosper my way which I go:

43 Behold, I stand by the well of
water; and it shall come to pass,
that when the virgin cometh forth
to draw water, and I say to her, Give
me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
pitcher to drink;

44 And she say to me, Both drink
thou, and I will also draw for thy

camels: let the same be the woman
whom the LORD hath a appointed
out for my master’s son.

45 And before I had done speaking
in mine a heart, behold, Rebekah
came forth with her pitcher on her
shoulder; and she went down unto
the well, and drew water: and I
said unto her, Let me drink, I pray
thee.

46 And she made haste, and let
down her pitcher from her shoulder,
and said, Drink, and I will give thy
camels drink also: so I drank, and
she made the camels drink also.

47 And I asked her, and said, Whose
daughter art thou? And she said, The
daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son,
whom Milcah bare unto him: and
I put the a earring upon her face,
and the bracelets upon her hands.
48 And I a bowed down my head,
and worshipped the LORD, and
blessed the LORD God of my master
Abraham, which had led me in
the right way to take my master’s
brother’s b daughter unto his son.

49 And now if ye will deal kindly
and truly with my master, tell me:
and if not, tell me; that I may turn
to the right hand, or to the left.

50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered
and said, The thing proceedeth
from the LORD: we cannot
a speak unto thee bad or good.

51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee,
take her, and go, and let her be thy
master’s son’s a wife, as the LORD
hath spoken.

52 And it came to pass, that, when
Abraham’s servant heard their
words, he worshipped the LORD,
bowing himself to the earth.

53 And the servant brought forth
a jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah:
he gave also to her brother
and to her mother precious things.

54 And they did eat and drink, he
and the men that were with him, and

in the morning, and he said, Send
me away unto my master.

55 And her brother and her mother
said, Let the damsel abide with us a

she shall go.

56 And he said unto them, Hinder
me not, seeing the LORD hath
a prospered my way; send me away
that I may go to my master.

57 And they said, We will call the

58 And they called Rebekah, and
said unto her, Wilt thou go with

59 And they sent away Rebekah
their sister, and her a nurse, and

60 And they blessed Rebekah, and
said unto her, Thou art our sister,
be thou the a mother of thousands

his way.

of the a well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt

64 And Rebekah lifted up her
eyes, and when she saw Isaac, a she
lighted off the camel.

65 For she had said unto the servant,
What man is this that walketh
in the field to meet us? And the
servant had said, It is my master:

therefore she took a veil, and covered
herself.

66 And the servant told Isaac all
things that he had done.

67 And Isaac brought her into his
mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah,
and she became his wife;
and he loved her: and Isaac was
a comforted after his mother’s b death.

CHAPTER 25

Abraham marries, has descendants,
dies, and is buried in the cave of Machpelah—His
descendants through Ishmael
are listed—Rebekah conceives,
and Jacob and Esau struggle in her
womb—The Lord reveals their destiny
to Rebekah—Esau sells his birthright
for a mess of pottage.

THEN again Abraham took a wife,
and her name was Keturah.

2 And she bare him Zimran, and
Jokshan, and a Medan, and b Midian,
and Ishbak, and Shuah.

3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and
Dedan. And the sons of Dedan
were Asshurim, and Letushim, and
Leummim.

4 And the sons of a Midian; Ephah,
and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida,
and Eldaah. All these were the children
of b Keturah.

5 ¶ And a Abraham b gave all that
he had unto Isaac.

6 But unto the sons of the a concubines,
which Abraham had, Abraham
gave gifts, and b sent them
away from Isaac his son, while he
yet lived, eastward, unto the c east
country.

7 And these are the a days of the
years of b Abraham’s life which he
lived, an hundred threescore and
fifteen years.

ghost, and died in a good a old age,
an old man, and full of years; and
was b gathered to his people.

9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael
a buried him in the cave of b Machpelah,
in the field of Ephron the
son of Zohar the Hittite, which is
before Mamre;

10 The field which Abraham a purchased
of the sons of Heth: there
was Abraham b buried, and Sarah
his wife.

11 ¶ And it came to pass after the
death of Abraham, that God blessed
his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by
the a well Lahai-roi.

12 ¶ Now these are the a generations
of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom
b Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid,
c bare unto Abraham:

13 And these are the names of the
sons of a Ishmael, by their names,
according to their generations: the
firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and
Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and
Massa,

15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish,
and Kedemah:

16 These are the sons of Ishmael,
and these are their names, by their
towns, and by their castles; a twelve
princes according to their nations.
17 And these are the years of the
life of Ishmael, an hundred and
thirty and seven years: and he gave
up the ghost and died; and was
gathered unto his people.

18 And they dwelt from a Havilah
unto b Shur, that is before Egypt,
as thou goest toward Assyria: and

he died in the presence of all his
brethren.

19 ¶ And these are the generations
of Isaac, Abraham’s son: a Abraham
begat Isaac:

20 And Isaac was forty years old
when he took Rebekah to wife, the
daughter of a Bethuel the Syrian of
b Padan-aram, the sister to Laban
the Syrian.

21 And Isaac entreated the LORD
for his a wife, because she was b barren:
and the LORD was c entreated
of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.22
And the children struggled together
within her; and she said, If it
be so, why am I thus? And she went
to a inquire of the LORD.

23 And the LORD said unto her,
a Two nations are in thy womb, and
two manner of people shall be separated
from thy bowels; and the one
people shall be stronger than the
other people; and the b elder shall
serve the younger.

24 ¶ And when her days to be delivered
were fulfilled, behold, there
were twins in her womb.

25 And the first came out red, all
over like an a hairy garment; and
they called his name b Esau.

26 And after that came his brother
out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s
a heel; and his b name was called c Jacob:
and Isaac was threescore years
old when she bare them.

27 And the boys grew: and Esau
was a cunning a hunter, a man of
the field; and Jacob was a b plain
man, dwelling in c tents.

28 And Isaac loved Esau, because
he did eat of his a venison: but b Rebekah
loved Jacob.

29 ¶ And Jacob sod pottage: and
Esau came from the field, and he
was faint:

30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed
me, I pray thee, with that same red
pottage; for I am faint: therefore was
his name called a Edom.

31 And Jacob said, Sell me this
day thy a birthright.

32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at
the point to die: and what profit
shall this birthright do to me?

33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this
day; and he sware unto him: and
he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread
and pottage of lentiles; and he did
eat and drink, and rose up, and
went his way: thus Esau despised
his birthright.

CHAPTER 26

The Lord promises Isaac posterity as
the stars of heaven in number—In his
seed, all nations will be blessed—The
Lord prospers Isaac, temporally and
spiritually, for Abraham’s sake—Isaac
offers sacrifices—Esau marries Hittite
wives to the sorrow of his parents.

AND there was a a famine in the
land, beside the first famine that
was in the days of Abraham. And
Isaac went unto b Abimelech king of
the c Philistines unto Gerar.

2 And the LORD appeared unto
him, and said, Go not down into
Egypt; dwell in the land which I
shall tell thee of:

3 a Sojourn in this land, and I will
be with thee, and will b bless thee;

for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I
will give all these c countries, and
I will perform the d oath which I
sware unto Abraham thy father;

4 And I will make thy a seed to
multiply as the stars of heaven, and
will give unto thy seed all these
countries; and in thy seed shall all
the b nations of the earth be blessed;
5 Because that Abraham a obeyed
my voice, and kept my b charge, my
commandments, my statutes, and
my laws.

6 ¶ And Isaac dwelt in a Gerar:
7 And the men of the place asked
him of his wife; and he said, She is
my a sister: for he feared to say, She is
my wife; lest, said he, the men of the
place should kill me for Rebekah;
because she was b fair to look upon.
8 And it came to pass, when he
had been there a long time, that
Abimelech king of the Philistines
looked out at a window, and saw,
and, behold, Isaac was sporting with
Rebekah his wife.

9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and
said, Behold, of a surety she is thy
wife: and how saidst thou, She is
my sister? And Isaac said unto him,
Because I said, Lest I die for her.

10 And a Abimelech said, What is
this thou hast done unto us? one of
the people might lightly have b lien
with thy wife, and thou shouldest
have c brought guiltiness upon us.
11 And Abimelech charged all his
people, saying, He that toucheth
this man or his wife shall surely
be put to death.

12 Then Isaac sowed in that land,
and received in the same year
an a hundredfold: and the LORD
b blessed him.

13 a And the man waxed b great,
and went forward, and grew until
he became very great:

14 For he had possession of flocks,
and possession of herds, and great
store of servants: and the Philistines
a envied him.

15 For all the a wells which his
father’s servants had digged in the
days of Abraham his father, the
Philistines b had stopped them, and
filled them with earth.

16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac,
Go from us; for thou art much
a mightier than we.

17 ¶ And Isaac departed thence,
and pitched his tent in the valley
of Gerar, and dwelt there.

18 And Isaac digged again the wells
of water, which they had digged in
the days of Abraham his father; for
the Philistines had stopped them
after the death of Abraham: and
he called their a names after the
names by which his father had
called them.

19 And Isaac’s servants digged in
the valley, and found there a well
of springing water.

20 And the herdmen of Gerar did
a strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying,
The water is ours: and he called
the name of the well b Esek; because
they strove with him.

21 And they digged another well,
and strove for that also: and he
called the name of it a Sitnah.

22 And he a removed from thence,
and digged another well; and for
that they b strove not: and he called
the name of it c Rehoboth; and he
said, For now the LORD hath made
room for us, and we shall be d fruitful
in the land.

23 And he went up from thence
to a Beer-sheba.

24 And the a LORD appeared unto
him the same night, and said, I am
the God of Abraham thy father: b fear
not, for c I am with thee, and will
bless thee, and multiply thy d seed
for my servant Abraham’s sake.

25 And he builded an a altar there,
and called upon the b name of the
LORD, and pitched his tent there:
and there Isaac’s servants digged
a well.

26 ¶ Then Abimelech went to him
from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of
his friends, and a Phichol the chief
captain of his army.

27 And Isaac said unto them,
Wherefore come ye to me, seeing
ye a hate me, and have sent me away
from you?

28 And they said, We saw certainly
that the a LORD was with thee: and
we said, Let there be now an oath
betwixt us, even betwixt us and
thee, and let us make a covenant
with thee;

29 That thou wilt do us no hurt,
as we have not touched thee, and
as we have done unto thee nothing
but good, and have sent thee away
in a peace: thou art now the b blessed
of the LORD.

30 And he made them a feast, and
they did eat and drink.

31 And they a rose up betimes in
the morning, and b sware one to another:
and Isaac sent them away, and
they departed from him in peace.
32 And it came to pass the same
day, that Isaac’s servants came, and
told him concerning the well which
they had digged, and said unto him,
We have found water.

unto this day.

34 ¶ And Esau was forty years old
when he took to a wife Judith the
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
Bashemath the daughter of Elon
the Hittite:

35 Which were a a grief of mind
unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

CHAPTER 27

Rebekah guides Jacob in seeking blessings—Jacob
is blessed to have dominion
and rule over peoples and nations—
Esau hates Jacob and plans to slay
him—Rebekah fears that Jacob may
marry one of the daughters of Heth.

AND it came to pass, that when Isaac
was old, and his eyes were a dim,
so that he could not see, he called
Esau his eldest son, and said unto
him, My son: and he said unto him,
Behold, here am I.

2 And he said, Behold now, I am
old, I know not the day of my death:
3 Now therefore take, I pray thee,
thy weapons, thy a quiver and thy
bow, and go out to the field, and
b take me some venison;

4 And make me a savoury meat,
such as I love, and bring it to me,
that I may eat; that my soul may
bless thee before I die.

5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac
spake to Esau his son. And Esau
went to the field to hunt for venison,
and to bring it.

6 ¶ And a Rebekah spake unto Jacob
her son, saying, Behold, I heard
thy father speak unto Esau thy
brother, saying,

7 Bring me venison, and make me
savoury meat, that I may eat, and
bless thee before the LORD before
my death.

8 Now therefore, my son, obey
my voice according to that which
I command thee.

9 Go now to the flock, and fetch
me from thence two good kids of
the goats; and I will make them
savoury meat for thy father, such
as he loveth:

10 And thou shalt bring it to thy
father, that he may eat, and that
he may bless thee before his death.
11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his
mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a
a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

12 My father peradventure will
feel me, and I shall seem to him as
a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse
upon me, and not a blessing.

13 And his mother said unto him,
Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

14 And he went, and fetched, and
brought them to his mother: and his
mother made savoury meat, such as
his father loved.

15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment
of her eldest son Esau, which
were with her in the house, and put
them upon Jacob her younger son:
16 And she put the a skins of the
kids of the goats upon his hands,
and upon the smooth of his neck:

17 And she gave the savoury meat
and the bread, which she had prepared,
into the hand of her son
Jacob.

18 ¶ And he came unto his father,
and said, My father: and he said,
Here am I; who art thou, my son?

19 And Jacob said unto his father,
I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done
according as thou badest me: arise,
I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison,
that thy soul may bless me.

20 And Isaac said unto his son,
How is it that thou hast found it so
quickly, my son? And he said, Because
the LORD thy God brought
it to me.

21 And Isaac said unto Jacob,
Come near, I pray thee, that I may
feel thee, my son, whether thou be
my very son Esau or not.

22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac
his father; and he felt him, and said,
The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the
hands are the hands of Esau.

23 And he discerned him not, because
his hands were hairy, as his
brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed
him.

24 And he said, Art thou my very
son Esau? And he said, I am.

25 And he said, Bring it near to me,
and I will eat of my son’s venison,
that my soul may bless thee. And
he brought it near to him, and he
did eat: and he brought him wine,
and he drank.

26 And his father Isaac said unto
him, Come near now, and kiss me,
my son.

27 And he came a near, and kissed
him: and he smelled the smell of
his raiment, and b blessed him, and
said, See, the smell of my son is as
the smell of a field which the LORD
hath blessed:

28 Therefore God give thee of the
a dew of heaven, and the fatness of
the earth, and plenty of corn and
wine:

29 Let people a serve thee, and nations
bow down to thee: be lord over
thy brethren, and let thy mother’s
sons b bow down to thee: cursed be
every one that curseth thee, and
c blessed be he that d blesseth thee.

30 ¶ And it came to pass, as soon
as Isaac had made an end of blessing
Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce
gone out from the presence of Isaac
his father, that Esau his brother
came in from his hunting.

31 And he also had made savoury
meat, and brought it unto his father,
and said unto his father, Let my
father arise, and eat of his son’s
venison, that thy soul may bless me.
32 And Isaac his father said unto

him, Who art thou? And he said, I
am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly,
and said, Who? where
is he that hath a taken venison, and
brought it me, and I have eaten of
all before thou camest, and have
b blessed him? yea, and he shall be
blessed.

34 And when Esau heard the words
of his father, he cried with a great
and exceeding bitter cry, and said
unto his father, Bless me, even me
also, O my father.

35 And he said, Thy brother came
with subtilty, and hath taken away
thy blessing.

36 And he said, Is not he rightly
named a Jacob? for he hath supplanted
me these two times: he took
away my b birthright; and, behold,
now he hath taken away my blessing.
And he said, Hast thou not reserved
a blessing for me?

37 And Isaac answered and said
unto Esau, Behold, I have made
him thy lord, and all his brethren
have I given to him for a servants;
and with corn and wine have I sustained
him: and what shall I do now
unto thee, my son?

38 And Esau said unto his father,
Hast thou but one blessing, my
father? bless me, even me also, O
my father. And Esau lifted up his
voice, and a wept.

39 And Isaac his father answered
and said unto him, Behold, thy
dwelling shall be the fatness of the
earth, and of the dew of heaven
from above;

40 And by thy sword shalt thou live,
and shalt serve thy a brother; and it
shall come to pass when thou shalt
have the dominion, that thou shalt
b break his c yoke from off thy neck.

of the blessing wherewith his father

heart, The days of mourning for

slay my brother Jacob.

42 And these words of Esau her
elder son were told to Rebekah:
and she sent and called Jacob her
younger son, and said unto him, Behold,
thy brother Esau, as touching
thee, doth comfort himself, purposing
to kill thee.

43 Now therefore, my son, obey
my voice; and arise, a flee thou to
Laban my b brother to c Haran;

44 And tarry with him a few days,
until thy brother’s fury turn away;
45 Until thy brother’s a anger turn
away from thee, and he forget that
which thou hast done to him: then
I will send, and fetch thee from
thence: why should I be deprived
also of you both in one day ?

46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I
am weary of my life because of the
a daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a
wife of the daughters of Heth, such
as these which are of the daughters
of the land, what good shall my
life do me?

CHAPTER 28

Isaac forbids Jacob to marry a Canaanite—He
blesses Jacob and his seed with
the blessings of Abraham—Esau marries
a daughter of Ishmael—Jacob sees in vision
a ladder reaching up into heaven—
The Lord promises him seed as the dust
of the earth in number—The Lord also
promises Jacob that in him and in his
seed all the families of the earth will be
blessed—Jacob covenants to pay tithes.
AND Isaac called Jacob, and blessed
him, and charged him, and said unto
him, Thou shalt not take a a wife of
the daughters of b Canaan.

house of b Bethuel thy mother’s

3 And God a Almighty b bless thee,
and make thee c fruitful, and multiply
thee, that thou mayest be a
d multitude of people;

4 And give thee the blessing of
Abraham, to thee, and to thy a seed
with thee; that thou mayest inherit
the land wherein thou art
a stranger, which God gave unto
Abraham.

5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and
he went to Padan-aram unto Laban,
son of Bethuel the a Syrian,
the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and
Esau’s mother.

6 ¶ When Esau saw that Isaac had
blessed Jacob, and sent him away
to Padan-aram, to take him a wife
from thence; and that as he blessed
him he gave him a charge, saying,
Thou shalt not take a wife of the
daughters of Canaan;

7 And that Jacob obeyed his father
and his mother, and was gone to
Padan-aram;

8 And Esau seeing that the daughters
of Canaan pleased not Isaac
his father;

9 Then went Esau unto a Ishmael,
and took unto the wives which he
had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael
Abraham’s son, the sister of
Nebajoth, to be his b wife.

10 ¶ And Jacob went out from
Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.

11 And he lighted upon a certain
place, and tarried there all night,
because the sun was set; and he took
of the stones of that place, and put
them for his pillows, and lay down
in that place to sleep.

12 And he a dreamed, and behold a

ladder set up on the earth, and the
top of it reached to heaven: and behold
the b angels of God ascending
and descending on it.

13 And, behold, the a LORD stood
b above it, and said, I am the c LORD
God of Abraham thy father, and
the God of Isaac: the d land whereon
thou liest, to thee will I give it, and
to thy seed;

14 And thy seed shall be as the

16 ¶ And Jacob awaked out of
his sleep, and he said, Surely the
LORD is in this place; and I knew it
not.

17 And he was afraid, and said,
How dreadful is this place! this is
none other but the house of God,
and this is the gate of a heaven.

18 And Jacob rose up early in the
morning, and took the stone that
he had put for his pillows, and set
it up for a a pillar, and poured oil
upon the top of it.

19 And he called the name of that
place a Beth-el: but the name of
that city was called b Luz at the first.
20 And Jacob vowed a a vow, saying,
If God will be with me, and
will keep me in this way that I go,
and will give me bread to eat, and
raiment to put on,

21 So that I come again to my

father’s house in peace; then shall
the a LORD be my God:

22 And this stone, which I have
set for a pillar, shall be God’s house:
and of all that thou shalt give me I
will surely give the a tenth unto thee.

CHAPTER 29

Jacob meets Rachel at the well—He
serves Laban seven years for her—
Laban gives to Jacob first Leah then
Rachel in marriage—Jacob serves another
seven years—Leah bears Reuben,
Simeon, Levi, and Judah.

THEN Jacob went on his journey,
and came into the land of the people
of the east.

2 And he looked, and behold a
well in the field, and, lo, there were
three flocks of sheep lying by it; for
out of that well they watered the
flocks: and a great stone was upon
the well’s mouth.

3 And thither were all the flocks
gathered: and they rolled the stone
from the well’s mouth, and watered
the sheep, and put the stone
again upon the well’s mouth in his
place.

4 And Jacob said unto them, My
brethren, whence be ye? And they
said, Of a Haran are we.

5 And he said unto them, Know
ye a Laban the son of Nahor? And
they said, We know him.

6 And he said unto them, Is he
well? And they said, He is well:
and, behold, Rachel his daughter
cometh with the sheep.

7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high
day, neither is it time that the cattle
should be gathered together:
water ye the sheep, and go and feed
them.

8 And they said, We cannot, until
all a the flocks be gathered together,
and till they roll the stone from
the well’s mouth; then we water
the sheep.

9 ¶ And while he yet spake with
them, Rachel came with her father’s
sheep: for she kept them.

10 And it came to pass, when Jacob
saw Rachel the daughter of Laban
his mother’s brother, and the sheep
of Laban his mother’s brother, that
Jacob went near, and rolled the
stone from the well’s mouth, and
a watered the flock of Laban his
mother’s brother.

11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and
lifted up his voice, and wept.

12 And Jacob told Rachel that he
was her father’s brother, and that
he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran
and told her father.

13 And it came to pass, when Laban
heard the tidings of Jacob his
sister’s son, that he ran to meet him,
and embraced him, and kissed
him, and brought him to his house.
And he told Laban all these things.
14 And Laban said to him, Surely
thou art my bone and my a flesh.
And he abode with him the space
of a month.

15 ¶ And Laban said unto Jacob,
Because thou art my brother,
shouldest thou therefore serve me
for nought? tell me, what shall thy
wages be?

16 And Laban had two daughters:
the name of the elder was Leah, and
the name of the younger was Rachel.
17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel
was a beautiful and well b favoured.18
And Jacob loved Rachel; and
said, I will a serve thee seven years
for Rachel thy younger daughter.

19 And Laban said, It is better
that I give her to thee, than that

I should give her to another man:
abide with me.

20 And Jacob served seven years
for a Rachel; and they seemed unto
him but a few days, for the b love he
had to her.

21 ¶ And Jacob said unto Laban,
Give me my wife, for my days are
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
22 And Laban gathered together
all the men of the place, and made
a a feast.

23 And it came to pass in the evening,
that he took Leah his daughter,
and brought her to him; and he
went in unto her.

24 And Laban gave unto his daughter
Leah a Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid.

25 And it came to pass, that in the
morning, behold, it was Leah: and
he said to Laban, What is this thou
hast done unto me? did not I serve
with thee for Rachel? wherefore
then hast thou beguiled me?

26 And Laban said, It must not
be so done in our country, to give
the younger before the a firstborn.
27 Fulfil her week, and we will
give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet
seven other years.

28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled
her week: and he gave him Rachel
his daughter to wife also.

29 And Laban gave to Rachel his
daughter a Bilhah his handmaid to
be her maid.

30 And he went in also unto Rachel,
and he a loved also Rachel
more than Leah, and b served with
him yet seven other years.

31 ¶ And when the LORD saw that
Leah was hated, he opened her
womb: but Rachel was a barren.

32 And a Leah conceived, and bare
a son, and she called his name b Reuben:
for she said, Surely the LORD

hath looked upon my affliction;
now therefore my husband will

33 And she conceived again, and
bare a son; and said, Because the
LORD hath heard that I was a hated,
he hath therefore given me this
son also: and she called his name
b Simeon.

34 And she conceived again, and
bare a son; and said, Now this time
will my husband be joined unto
me, because I have born him three
sons: therefore was his name called
a Levi.

35 And she conceived again, and
bare a son: and she said, Now will
I a praise the LORD: therefore she
called his name b Judah; and left
bearing.

CHAPTER 30

Jacob marries Bilhah, and she bears
Dan and Naphtali—He marries Zilpah,
and she bears Gad and Asher—
Leah bears Issachar and Zebulun and
a daughter, Dinah—Then Rachel conceives
and bears Joseph—Jacob works
for Laban for wages of cattle and sheep.
AND when Rachel saw that she bare
Jacob no children, Rachel a envied
her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give
me children, or else I die.

2 And Jacob’s anger was kindled
against Rachel: and he said, Am I
in a God’s stead, who hath withheld
from thee the fruit of the womb?
3 And she said, Behold my maid
Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall
bear upon my knees, that I may also
a have children by her.

4 And she gave him a Bilhah her

handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
in unto her.

5 And a Bilhah conceived, and bare
Jacob a son.

6 And Rachel said, God hath
judged me, and hath also heard
my voice, and hath given me a son:
therefore called she his name a Dan.
7 And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived
again, and bare Jacob a second
son.

8 And Rachel said, a With great
wrestlings have I wrestled with my
sister, and I have prevailed: and she
called his name b Naphtali.

9 When Leah saw that she had left
bearing, she took Zilpah her maid,
and gave her Jacob to wife.

10 And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare
Jacob a son.

11 And Leah said, A a troop cometh:
and she called his name b Gad.

12 And a Zilpah Leah’s maid bare
Jacob a second son.

13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for
the daughters will call me a blessed:
and she called his name b Asher.

14 ¶ And Reuben went in the days
of wheat harvest, and found a mandrakes
in the field, and brought
them unto his mother Leah. Then
Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray
thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.

15 And she said unto her, Is it a
small matter that thou hast a taken
my husband? and wouldest thou
take away my son’s mandrakes also?
And Rachel said, Therefore he shall
lie with thee to night for thy son’s
mandrakes.

16 And Jacob came out of the field
in the evening, and Leah went out to
meet him, and said, Thou must come

17 And God hearkened unto Leah,
and she conceived, and bare Jacob
the fifth son.

18 And Leah said, God hath given
me my a hire, because I have given
my maiden to my husband: and she
called his name b Issachar.

19 And Leah conceived again, and
bare Jacob the sixth son.

20 And Leah said, God hath endued

and she called his name b Zebulun.

and God hearkened to her,
and opened her womb.

23 And she conceived, and bare a

24 And she called his name a Joseph;
and said, The LORD shall add to me
another son.

25 ¶ And it came to pass, when
Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
said unto Laban, Send me away, that
I may go unto mine own place, and
to my country.

26 Give me my wives and my children,
for whom I have a served thee,
and let me go: for thou knowest my
service which I have done thee.

27 And Laban said unto him, I
pray thee, if I have found favour in
thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned
by experience that the LORD hath
a blessed me for thy b sake.

28 And he said, Appoint me thy
wages, and I will give it.

29 And he said unto him, Thou
knowest how I have served thee, and
how thy cattle was with me.

30 For it was little which thou
hadst before I came, and it is now
increased unto a multitude; and
the LORD hath blessed thee since
my coming: and now when shall I
provide for mine own house also?
31 And he said, What shall I give
thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt
not give me any thing: if thou wilt
do this thing for me, I will again
feed and keep thy flock:

32 I will pass through all thy flock
to day, removing from thence all
the speckled and spotted a cattle,
and all the brown cattle among the
sheep, and the spotted and speckled
among the goats: and of such shall
be my hire.

33 So shall my a righteousness answer
for me in time to come, when
it shall come for my hire before thy
face: every one that is not speckled
and spotted among the goats, and
brown among the sheep, that shall
be counted stolen with me.

34 And Laban said, Behold, I
would it might be according to thy
word.

35 And he removed that day the
he goats that were ringstraked and
spotted, and all the she goats that
were speckled and spotted, and every
one that had some white in it,
and all the brown among the sheep,
and gave them into the hand of
his sons.

36 And he set three days’ journey
betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob
fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.

38 And he set the rods which he
had pilled before the flocks in the
gutters in the watering troughs
when the flocks came to drink, that
they should conceive when they
came to drink.

39 And the flocks conceived before
the a rods, and brought forth cattle
ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

40 And Jacob did separate the
lambs, and set the faces of the
flocks toward the ringstraked, and
all the brown in the flock of Laban;
and he put his own flocks by
themselves, and put them not unto
Laban’s cattle.

41 And it came to pass, whensoever
the stronger cattle did conceive, that
Jacob laid the rods before the eyes
of the cattle in the gutters, that they
might conceive among the rods.

42 But when the cattle were feeble,
he put them not in: so the feebler
were Laban’s, and the stronger
Jacob’s.

43 And the man a increased exceedingly,
and had much cattle, and
maidservants, and menservants,
and camels, and asses.

CHAPTER 31

The Lord commands Jacob to return to
Canaan, and Jacob departs secretly—
Laban pursues him; they resolve their
differences and make a covenant of
peace—Laban blesses his descendants,
and he and Jacob part company.

AND he heard the words of Laban’s
sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away
all that was our father’s; and of that
which was our father’s hath he gotten
all this a glory.

2 And Jacob beheld the countenance
of Laban, and, behold, it was
not toward him as before.

3 And the LORD said unto Jacob,
a Return unto the land of thy fathers,
and to thy kindred; and b I will be
with thee.

4 And a Jacob sent and called Rachel
and Leah to the field unto his
flock,

5 And said unto them, I see your
father’s countenance, that it is not
toward me as before; but the God
of my father hath been with me.

6 And ye know that with all my
power I have served your father.

7 And your father hath deceived
me, and changed my wages ten
times; but God suffered him not
to hurt me.

8 If he said thus, The speckled shall
be thy wages; then all the cattle
bare speckled: and if he said thus,
The ringstraked shall be thy hire;
then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
9 Thus God hath taken away the
cattle of your father, and given
them to me.

10 And it came to pass at the time
that the a cattle conceived, that I
lifted up mine eyes, and saw in
a dream, and, behold, the rams
which leaped upon the cattle were
ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
11 And the a angel of God spake
unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
And I said, Here am I.

12 And he said, Lift up now thine
eyes, and see, all the rams which
leap upon the a cattle are ringstraked,
speckled, and grisled: for I have
seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
13 I am the a God of Beth-el, where
thou anointedst the b pillar, and
where thou vowedst a c vow unto
me: now arise, get thee out from
this land, and return unto the land
of thy kindred.

15 Are we not counted of him
strangers? for he hath sold us, and
hath quite devoured also our money.

16 For all the riches which God
hath taken from our father, that is
ours, and our children’s: now then,
whatsoever God hath said unto
thee, do.

17 ¶ Then Jacob rose up, and set
his sons and his wives upon camels;

18 And he carried away all his
cattle, and all his goods which he
had gotten, the cattle of his getting,
which he had gotten in Padan-aram,
for to go to Isaac his father in the
land of Canaan.

19 And Laban went to shear his
sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
a images that were her father’s.

20 And Jacob stole away unawares
to Laban the a Syrian, in that he told
him not that he fled.

21 So he fled with all that he had;
and he rose up, and passed over the
river, and set his face toward the
mount Gilead.

22 And it was told Laban on the
third day that Jacob was fled.

23 And he took his brethren with
him, and pursued after him seven
days’ journey; and they overtook
him in the mount Gilead.

24 And God came to Laban the
Syrian in a a dream by night, and
said unto him, Take heed that thou
b speak not to Jacob either good or
bad.

25 ¶ Then Laban overtook Jacob.
Now Jacob had pitched his tent
in the mount: and Laban with his
brethren pitched in the mount of
Gilead.

26 And Laban said to Jacob, What
hast thou done, that thou hast stolen
away unawares to me, and carried
away my daughters, as captives
taken with the sword?

27 Wherefore didst thou flee away
secretly, and steal away from me;
and didst not tell me, that I might
have sent thee away with mirth,
and with songs, with tabret, and
with a harp?

28 And hast not suffered me to kiss
my sons and my daughters? thou
hast now done foolishly in so doing.

29 It is in the power of my hand
to do you hurt: but the God of your
father spake unto me yesternight,
saying, Take thou heed that thou
speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

30 And now, though thou wouldest
needs be gone, because thou sore
longedst after thy father’s house, yet
wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

31 And Jacob answered and said
to Laban, Because I was afraid: for
I said, Peradventure thou wouldest
take by force thy daughters from me.

32 With whomsoever thou findest
thy gods, let him not live: before
our brethren discern thou what is
thine with me, and take it to thee.
For Jacob knew not that Rachel had
stolen them.

33 And Laban went into Jacob’s
tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into
the two maidservants’ tents; but
he found them not. Then went he
out of Leah’s tent, and entered into
Rachel’s tent.

34 Now Rachel had taken the images,
and put them in the camel’s
furniture, and sat upon them. And
Laban searched all the tent, but
found them not.

35 And she said to her father, Let
it not displease my lord that I cannot
rise up before thee; for the custom
of women is upon me. And he
searched, but found not the images.
36 ¶ And Jacob was wroth, and
chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
and said to Laban, What is
my trespass? what is my sin, that
thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

37 Whereas thou hast searched all
my stuff, what hast thou found of
all thy household stuff? set it here
before my brethren and thy brethren,
that they may judge betwixt
us both.

38 This twenty years have I been
with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats

39 That which was a torn of beasts
I brought not unto thee; I bare the
loss of it; of my hand didst thou
require it, whether stolen by day, or
stolen by night.

40 Thus I was; in the day the
a drought consumed me, and the frost
by night; and my sleep departed
from mine eyes.

41 Thus have I been twenty years
in thy house; I a served thee fourteen
years for thy two daughters, and
six years for thy cattle: and thou
hast changed my wages ten times.

42 Except the God of my father,
the God of Abraham, and the fear
of Isaac, had been with me, surely
thou hadst sent me away now empty.
God hath seen mine affliction and
the a labour of my hands, and rebuked
thee yesternight.

43 ¶ And Laban answered and said
unto Jacob, These daughters are my
daughters, and these children are my
children, and these cattle are my cattle,
and all that thou seest is mine:
and what can I do this day unto
these my daughters, or unto their
children which they have born?

44 Now therefore come thou, let
us make a covenant, I and thou;
and let it be for a witness between
me and thee.

45 And Jacob took a stone, and set
it up for a a pillar.

46 And Jacob said unto his brethren,
Gather stones; and they took
stones, and made an heap: and they
did eat there upon the heap.

47 And Laban called it a Jegarsahadutha:
but Jacob called it
b Galeed.

48 And Laban said, This heap is a
witness between me and thee this
day. Therefore was the name of it
called Galeed;

49 And a Mizpah; for he said, The
LORD b watch between me and thee,

when we are absent one from another.50
If thou shalt afflict my daughters,
or if thou shalt take other wives
beside my daughters, no man is with
us; see, God is witness betwixt me
and thee.

51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold
this heap, and behold this pillar,
which I have cast betwixt me
and thee;

52 This heap be witness, and this
pillar be witness, that I will not pass
over this heap to thee, and that
thou shalt not pass over this heap
and this pillar unto me, for harm.

53 The God of Abraham, and the
God of Nahor, the God of their
father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob
sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice
upon the mount, and called his
brethren to eat bread: and they did
eat a bread, and tarried all night in
the mount.

55 And early in the morning Laban
rose up, and kissed his sons and his
daughters, and blessed them: and
Laban departed, and returned unto
his place.

CHAPTER 32

Jacob sees angels—He asks God to
preserve him from Esau, for whom he
prepares presents—He wrestles all night
with a messenger of God—Jacob’s name
is changed to Israel—He sees God face
to face.

AND Jacob went on his way, and the
angels of God met him.

2 And when Jacob saw them, he
said, This is God’s a host: and he called
the name of that place b Mahanaim.

3 And Jacob sent messengers before
him to Esau his brother unto the
land of a Seir, the country of b Edom.

saying, Thus shall ye speak unto
my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob
saith thus, I have sojourned with
Laban, and stayed there until now:
5 And I have oxen, and asses,
flocks, and menservants, and womenservants:
and I have sent to tell
my lord, that I may find grace in
thy sight.

6 ¶ And the messengers returned
to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
brother Esau, and also he cometh
to meet thee, and four hundred
men with him.

7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid
and a distressed: and he divided the
people that was with him, and the
flocks, and herds, and the camels,
into two bands;

8 And said, If Esau come to the
one company, and smite it, then
the other company which is left
shall escape.

9 ¶ And Jacob said, O a God of my
father Abraham, and God of my father
Isaac, the LORD which saidst
unto me, b Return unto thy country,
and to thy kindred, and I will deal
well with thee:

10 a I am not worthy of the least of
all the b mercies, and of all the truth,
which thou hast shewed unto thy
servant; for with my staff I passed
over this Jordan; and now I am become
two bands.

11 a Deliver me, I pray thee, from
the hand of my brother, from the
hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest
he will come and smite me, and the
mother with the children.

12 And thou saidst, I will surely do
thee good, and make thy a seed as
the b sand of the sea, which cannot
be numbered for multitude.

13 ¶ And he lodged there that
same night; and took of that which
came to his hand a present for Esau
his brother;

14 Two hundred she goats, and

twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
and twenty rams,

15 Thirty milch camels with their
colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,
twenty she asses, and ten foals.

16 And he delivered them into the
hand of his servants, every drove
by themselves; and said unto his
servants, Pass over before me, and
put a space betwixt drove and
drove.

17 And he commanded the foremost,
saying, When Esau my brother
meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying,
Whose art thou? and whither
goest thou? and whose are these
before thee?

18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy
servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent
unto my lord Esau: and, behold,
also he is behind us.

19 And so commanded he the second,
and the third, and all that followed
the droves, saying, On this
manner shall ye speak unto Esau,
when ye find him.

20 And say ye moreover, Behold,
thy servant Jacob is behind us.
For he said, I will appease him
with the present that goeth before
me, and afterward I will see his
face; peradventure he will accept
of me.

21 So went the present over before
him: and himself lodged that night
in the company.

22 And he rose up that night, and
took his two wives, and his two
womenservants, and his eleven sons,
and passed over the ford Jabbok.

23 And he took them, and sent
them over the brook, and sent over
that he had.

24 ¶ And Jacob was left alone; and
there a wrestled a man with him until
the breaking of the day.

25 And when he saw that he prevailed
not against him, he touched
the hollow of his thigh; and the

hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of
joint, as he wrestled with him.

26 And he said, Let me go, for the
day breaketh. And he said, I will
not let thee go, except thou bless
me.

27 And he said unto him, What is
thy name? And he said, Jacob.

28 And he said, Thy a name shall
be called no more Jacob, but b Israel:
c for as a d prince hast thou e power
with God and with men, and hast
f prevailed.

29 And Jacob asked him, and said,
Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And
he said, Wherefore is it that thou
dost ask after my a name? And he
b blessed him there.

30 And Jacob called the name of
the place a Peniel: for I have b seen
God c face to face, and my life is
preserved.

31 And as he passed over a Penuel
the sun rose upon him, and he
halted upon his thigh.

32 Therefore the children of Israel
eat not of the sinew which shrank,
which is upon the hollow of the
thigh, unto this day: because he
touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh
in the sinew that shrank.

CHAPTER 33

Jacob and Esau meet and are reconciled—Esau
receives Jacob’s presents—
Jacob settles in Canaan, where he builds
an altar.

AND Jacob lifted up his eyes, and
looked, and, behold, Esau came,
and with him four hundred men.
And he divided the children unto
Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto
the two handmaids.

2 And he put the handmaids and
their children foremost, and Leah

and her children after, and Rachel
and Joseph hindermost.

3 And he passed over before them,
and a bowed himself to the ground
seven times, until he came near to
his brother.

4 And Esau ran to meet him, and
embraced him, and fell on his neck,
and kissed him: and they wept.

5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw
the women and the children; and
said, Who are those with thee? And
he said, The children which God
hath graciously given thy servant.
6 Then the handmaidens came
near, they and their children, and
they bowed themselves.

7 And Leah also with her children
came near, and bowed themselves:
and after came Joseph near and Rachel,
and they bowed themselves.
8 And he said, What meanest thou
by all this drove which I met? And
he said, These are to find grace in
the sight of my lord.

9 And Esau said, I have enough,
my brother; keep that thou hast
unto thyself.

10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee,
if now I have found grace in thy sight,
then receive my present at my hand:
for therefore I have seen thy face, as
though I had seen the face of God,
and thou wast pleased with me.

11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing
that is brought to thee; because
God hath dealt graciously with me,
and because I have enough. And he
urged him, and he took it.

12 And he said, Let us take our
journey, and let us go, and I will
go before thee.

13 And he said unto him, My lord
knoweth that the children are tender,
and the flocks and herds with young
are with me: and if men should

overdrive them one day, all the

14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass
over before his servant: and I will
lead on softly, according as the cattle
that goeth before me and the
children be able to endure, until I
come unto my lord unto Seir.

15 And Esau said, Let me now leave
with thee some of the folk that are
with me. And he said, What needeth
it? let me find grace in the sight of
my lord.

16 ¶ So Esau returned that day on
his way unto Seir.

17 And Jacob journeyed to a Succoth,
and built him an house, and
made booths for his cattle: therefore
the name of the place is called
b Succoth.

18 ¶ And Jacob came to Shalem,
a city of Shechem, which is in the
land of Canaan, when he came from
Padan-aram; and pitched his tent
before the city.

19 And he bought a parcel of a
field, where he had spread his
tent, at the hand of the children
of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an
hundred pieces of money.

20 And he erected there an altar,
and called it a El-elohe-Israel.

CHAPTER 34

Shechem defiles Dinah—The Hivites
seek to arrange marriages with Jacob’s
family—Many, having been circumcised,
are slain by Simeon and Levi—
Jacob reproves his sons.

AND Dinah the daughter of Leah,
which she bare unto Jacob, went
out to see the daughters of the
land.

2 And when Shechem the son of
a Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
country, saw her, he took her, and
lay with her, and defiled her.

3 And his soul clave unto Dinah
the daughter of Jacob, and he loved

the damsel, and spake kindly unto
the damsel.

4 And Shechem spake unto his
father Hamor, saying, Get me this
damsel to wife.

5 And Jacob heard that he had
defiled Dinah his daughter: now
his sons were with his cattle in the
field: and Jacob held his peace until
they were come.

6 ¶ And Hamor the father of Shechem
went out unto Jacob to commune
with him.

7 And the sons of Jacob came
out of the field when they heard
it: and the men were grieved, and
they were very a wroth, because he
had wrought folly in Israel in lying
with Jacob’s daughter; which thing
ought not to be done.

8 And Hamor communed with
them, saying, The soul of my son
Shechem longeth for your daughter:
I pray you give her him to wife.
9 And make ye marriages with us,
and give your daughters unto us,
and take our daughters unto you.
10 And ye shall dwell with us: and
the a land shall be before you; dwell
and b trade ye therein, and get you
possessions therein.

11 And Shechem said unto her
father and unto her brethren, Let
me find grace in your eyes, and what
ye shall say unto me I will give.

12 Ask me a never so much dowry
and gift, and I will give according
as ye shall say unto me: but give
me the damsel to wife.

13 And the sons of Jacob answered
Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully,
and said, because he had
defiled Dinah their sister:

14 a And they said unto them, We
cannot do this thing, to give our
sister to one that is b uncircumcised;
for that were a reproach unto us:

15 But in this will we consent unto
you: If ye will be as we be, that every

16 Then will we give our daughters
unto you, and we will take your
daughters to us, and we will dwell
with you, and we will become one
people.

17 But if ye will not hearken unto
us, to be circumcised; then will we
take our daughter, and we will be
gone.

18 And their words pleased Hamor,
and Shechem Hamor’s son.

19 And the young man deferred
not to do the thing, because he had
delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he
was more honourable than all the
house of his father.

20 ¶ And Hamor and Shechem his
son came unto the a gate of their
city, and communed with the men
of their city, saying,

21 These men are peaceable with
us; therefore let them dwell in the
land, and trade therein; for the land,
behold, it is large enough for them;
let us take their daughters to us
for wives, and let us give them our
daughters.

22 Only herein will the men consent
unto us for to dwell with us,
to be one people, if every male
among us be circumcised, as they
are circumcised.

23 Shall not their cattle and their
substance and every beast of theirs
be ours? only let us consent unto
them, and they will dwell with us.
24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem
his son hearkened all that
went out of the gate of his city; and
every male was circumcised, all
that went out of the gate of his city.

25 ¶ And it came to pass on the
third day, when they were sore, that
two of the sons of Jacob, a Simeon and
Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each
man his sword, and came upon the
city boldly, and slew all the males.
26 And they a slew Hamor and Shechem
his son with the edge of the
sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s
house, and went out.

27 The sons of Jacob came upon
the slain, and spoiled the city, because
they had defiled their sister.

28 They took their sheep, and their
oxen, and their asses, and that which
was in the city, and that which was
in the field,

29 And all their wealth, and all
their little ones, and their wives
took they captive, and spoiled even
all that was in the house.

30 And Jacob said to Simeon and
Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
me to stink among the inhabitants
of the land, among the Canaanites
and the Perizzites: and I being few
in number, they shall gather themselves
together against me, and slay
me; and I shall be destroyed, I and
my house.

31 And they said, Should he deal
with our sister as with an harlot?

CHAPTER 35

God sends Jacob to Bethel, where he
builds an altar and the Lord appears
to him—God renews the promise that
Jacob will be a great nation and that his
name will be Israel—Jacob sets up an
altar and pours a drink offering—Rachel
bears Benjamin, dies in childbirth,
and is buried near Bethlehem—Reuben
sins with Bilhah—Isaac dies and is
buried by Jacob and Esau.

AND God said unto Jacob, Arise,
go up to Beth-el, and dwell there:
and make there an altar unto God,
that appeared unto thee when thou
a fleddest from the face of Esau thy
brother.

2 Then Jacob said unto his household,
and to all that were with him,
Put away the strange a gods that
are among you, and be b clean, and
change your garments:

3 And let us arise, and go up to
Beth-el; and I will make there an
altar unto God, who answered me in

4 And they gave unto Jacob all the
strange gods which were in their
hand, and all their earrings which
were in their ears; and Jacob hid
them under the oak which was by
Shechem.

5 And they journeyed: and the terror
of God was upon the cities that
were round about them, and they did
not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
6 ¶ So Jacob came to a Luz, which
is in the land of Canaan, that is,
Beth-el, he and all the people that
were with him.

7 And he built there an altar, and
called the place El-beth-el: because
there God appeared unto him, when
he fled from the face of his brother.
8 But Deborah Rebekah’s a nurse
died, and she was buried beneath
Beth-el under an oak: and the name
of it was called b Allon-bachuth.

9 ¶ And God appeared unto Jacob
again, when he came out of Padanaram,
and blessed him.

10 And God said unto him, Thy
name is Jacob: thy name shall not
be called any more Jacob, but a Israel
shall be thy name: and he called
his name Israel.

11 And God said unto him, I am
a God Almighty: be b fruitful and
multiply; a nation and a company
of c nations shall be of thee, and
d kings shall come out of thy loins;
12 And the a land which I gave
Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
give it, and to thy seed after thee
will I give the land.

13 And God went up from him in
the place where he talked with him.
14 And Jacob set up a a pillar in
the place where he talked with
him, even a pillar of stone: and he

poured a b drink offering thereon,
and he poured oil thereon.

15 And Jacob called the name of
the place where God spake with
him, Beth-el.

16 ¶ And they journeyed from
Beth-el; and there was but a little
way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel
travailed, and she had hard
labour.

17 And it came to pass, when she
was in hard labour, that the midwife
said unto her, Fear not; thou
shalt have this son also.

18 And it came to pass, as her soul
was in departing, (for she a died) that
she called his name b Ben-oni: but
his father called him c Benjamin.
19 And a Rachel died, and was buried
in the way to b Ephrath, which
is Beth-lehem.

20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her
grave: that is the pillar of Rachel’s
grave unto this day.

21 ¶ And Israel journeyed, and
spread his tent beyond the a tower
of Edar.

22 And it came to pass, when Israel
dwelt in that land, that Reuben went
and a lay with Bilhah his father’s
concubine: and Israel heard it. Now
the b sons of Jacob were c twelve:

23 The sons of Leah; a Reuben,
Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and
Levi, and Judah, and Issachar,
and Zebulun:

24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and
Benjamin:

25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s
handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s
handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these
are the sons of Jacob, which were
born to him in Padan-aram.

his father unto Mamre, unto the city
of Arbah, which is Hebron, where
Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

28 And the a days of b Isaac were

29 And Isaac gave up the ghost,
and died, and was a gathered unto

b buried him.

CHAPTER 36

The descendants of Esau, who is Edom,
are listed.

NOW these are the generations of
Esau, who is a Edom.

2 Esau took his wives of the daughters
of Canaan; Adah the daughter
of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah
the daughter of Anah the daughter
of Zibeon the Hivite;

3 And Bashemath a Ishmael’s
daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz;
and Bashemath bare Reuel;

5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush,
and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
the sons of Esau, which were born
unto him in the land of Canaan.

6 And Esau took his wives, and his
sons, and his daughters, and all the
persons of his house, and his cattle,
and all his beasts, and all his substance,
which he had got in the land
of Canaan; and went into the country
from the face of his brother Jacob.
7 For their riches were more than
that they might dwell together; and
the land wherein they were strangers
could not bear them because of
their cattle.

8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount a Seir:
Esau is Edom.

9 ¶ And these are the a generations
of b Esau the father of the Edomites
in mount Seir:

10 These are the names of Esau’s

sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the
wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath
the wife of Esau.

11 And the sons of Eliphaz were
Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,
and Kenaz.

12 And Timna was concubine to
Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bare
to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the
sons of Adah Esau’s wife.

13 And these are the sons of Reuel;
Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
and Mizzah: these were the sons of
Bashemath Esau’s wife.

14 ¶ And these were the sons of

CHAPTER 37

Jacob loves and favors Joseph, who is
hated by his brothers—Joseph dreams
that his parents and brothers make
obeisance to him—His brothers sell
him into Egypt.

AND Jacob dwelt in the land a wherein
his father was a b stranger, in the
land of Canaan.

2 These are the a generations of Jacob.
b Joseph, being seventeen years
old, was feeding the flock with his
brethren; and the lad was with the
sons of Bilhah, and with the sons
of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph
brought unto his father their
evil report.

3 Now Israel loved a Joseph more
than all his children, because he
was the son of his old age: and he
made him a b coat of many c colours.
4 And when his brethren saw that

their father loved him more than all
his brethren, they hated him, and
could not speak peaceably unto him.
5 ¶ And Joseph dreamed a a dream,
and he told it his brethren: and they
hated him yet the more.

6 And he said unto them, Hear, I
pray you, this dream which I have
dreamed:

7 For, behold, we were binding
sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
sheaf arose, and also stood upright;
and, behold, your sheaves stood
round about, and made a obeisance
to my sheaf.

8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt
thou indeed reign over us? or shalt
thou indeed have dominion over us?
And they hated him yet the more for
his dreams, and for his words.

9 ¶ And he dreamed yet another
dream, and told it his brethren,
and said, Behold, I have dreamed
a dream more; and, behold, the sun
and the moon and the eleven stars
made obeisance to me.

10 And he told it to his father,
and to his brethren: and his father
rebuked him, and said unto him,
What is this dream that thou hast
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother
and thy brethren indeed come to
a bow down ourselves to thee to the
earth?

11 And his brethren a envied him;
but his father observed the saying.
12 ¶ And his brethren went to feed
their father’s a flock in Shechem.

13 And Israel said unto Joseph,
Do not thy brethren feed the flock
in Shechem? come, and I will send
thee unto them. And he said to him,
Here am I.

14 And he said to him, Go, I pray
thee, see whether it be well with
thy brethren, and well with the
flocks; and bring me word again.
So he sent him out of the vale of
Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
15 ¶ And a certain man found him,
and, behold, he was wandering in

the field: and the man asked him,
saying, What seekest thou?

16 And he said, I seek my brethren:
tell me, I pray thee, where they
feed their flocks.

17 And the man said, They are
departed hence; for I heard them
say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph
went after his brethren, and
found them in Dothan.

18 And when they saw him afar
off, even before he came near unto
them, they a conspired against him
to slay him.

19 And they said one to another,
Behold, this a dreamer cometh.

20 Come now therefore, and let us
slay him, and cast him into some
pit, and we will say, Some evil beast
hath devoured him: and we shall
see what will become of his dreams.
21 And a Reuben heard it, and he
delivered him out of their hands;
and said, Let us not kill him.

22 And Reuben said unto them,
Shed no blood, but cast him into
this pit that is in the wilderness,
and lay no hand upon him; that he
might rid him out of their hands,
to deliver him to his father again.
23 ¶ And it came to pass, when
Joseph was come unto his brethren,
that they stript Joseph out of
his a coat, his coat of many colours
that was on him;

24 And they took him, and cast him
into a pit: and the pit was empty,
there was no water in it.

25 And they sat down to eat bread:
and they lifted up their eyes and
looked, and, behold, a company of
Ishmeelites came from Gilead with
their camels bearing spicery and
balm and myrrh, going to carry it
down to Egypt.

26 And Judah said unto his brethren,
What profit is it if we slay our
brother, and conceal his blood?

27 Come, and let us sell him to the
Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be
upon him; for he is our brother and

content.

28 Then there passed by Midianites
merchantmen; and they drew
and lifted up Joseph out of the pit,
and sold Joseph to the a Ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver: and they
brought Joseph into Egypt.

29 ¶ And Reuben returned unto
the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
30 And he returned unto his brethren,
and said, The child is a not; and
I, whither shall I go?

31 And they took Joseph’s coat,
and killed a kid of the goats, and
dipped the coat in the blood;

32 And they sent the coat of many
colours, and they brought it to their
father; and said, This have we found:
know now whether it be thy son’s
coat or no.

33 And he knew it, and said, It is
my son’s a coat; an evil beast hath
devoured him; Joseph is without
doubt b rent in pieces.

34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and
put sackcloth upon his loins, and
mourned for his son many days.

35 And all his a sons and all his
daughters rose up to comfort him;
but he refused to be b comforted;
and he said, For I will go down into
the grave unto my son c mourning.
Thus his father wept for him.

36 And the Midianites a sold him
into Egypt unto b Potiphar, an c officer
of Pharaoh’s, and d captain of
the guard.

CHAPTER 38

Judah has three sons by a Canaanite
woman—Er and Onan are slain by the
Lord—Tamar, disguised as a harlot,
bears twins by Judah.

AND it came to pass at that time,

that Judah went down from his
brethren, and turned in to a certain
Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
2 And Judah saw there a a daughter
of a certain Canaanite, whose
name was Shuah; and he took her,
and went in unto her.

3 And she conceived, and bare a
son; and he called his name a Er.

4 And she conceived again, and
bare a son; and she called his name
Onan.

5 And she yet again conceived,
and bare a son; and called his name
Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when
she bare him.

6 And Judah took a wife for Er his
firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
7 And a Er, Judah’s firstborn, was
wicked in the sight of the LORD;
and the LORD slew him.

8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in
unto thy brother’s a wife, and marry
her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
9 And Onan knew that the seed
should not be his; and it came to
pass, when he went in unto his
brother’s wife, that he spilled it on
the ground, lest that he should give
seed to his brother.

10 And the thing which he did
displeased the LORD: wherefore he
slew him also.

11 Then said Judah to Tamar his
daughter in law, Remain a widow
at thy father’s house, till Shelah
my son be grown: for he said, Lest
peradventure he die also, as his
brethren did. And Tamar went and
dwelt in her father’s house.

12 ¶ And in process of time the
daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife
died; and Judah was comforted, and
went up unto his sheepshearers to
Timnath, he and his friend Hirah
the Adullamite.

13 And it was told Tamar, saying,

Behold thy father in law goeth up
to Timnath to shear his sheep.

14 And she put her widow’s garments
off from her, and covered her
with a veil, and wrapped herself,
and sat in an open place, which is
by the way to Timnath; for she saw
that Shelah was grown, and she was
not given unto him to wife.

15 When Judah saw her, he thought
her to be an harlot; because she had
covered her face.

16 And he turned unto her by the
way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let
me come in unto thee; (for he knew
not that she was his daughter in
law.) And she said, What wilt thou
give me, that thou mayest come in
unto me?

17 And he said, I will send thee a
kid from the flock. And she said,
Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou
send it?

18 And he said, What pledge shall
I give thee? And she said, Thy a signet,
and thy bracelets, and thy staff
that is in thine hand. And he gave
it her, and came in unto her, and
she conceived by him.

19 And she arose, and went away,
and laid by her veil from her, and put
on the garments of her widowhood.

20 And Judah sent the kid by the
hand of his friend the Adullamite,
to receive his pledge from the woman’s
hand: but he found her not.

21 Then he asked the men of that
place, saying, Where is the harlot,
that was openly by the way side?
And they said, There was no harlot
in this place.

22 And he returned to Judah, and
said, I cannot find her; and also the
men of the place said, that there
was no harlot in this place.

23 And Judah said, Let her take it to
her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent
this kid, and thou hast not found her.
24 ¶ And it came to pass about
three months after, that it was told

Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter
in law hath played the harlot; and
also, behold, she is with child by
whoredom. And Judah said, Bring
her forth, and let her be a burnt.

25 When she was brought forth, she
sent to her father in law, saying, By
the man, whose these are, am I with
child: and she said, Discern, I pray
thee, whose are these, the a signet,
and bracelets, and staff.

26 And Judah acknowledged them,
and said, She hath been more righteous
than I; because that I gave her
not to Shelah my son. And he knew
her again no more.

27 ¶ And it came to pass in the
time of her travail, that, behold,
twins were in her womb.

28 And it came to pass, when she
travailed, that the one put out his
hand: and the midwife took and
bound upon his hand a scarlet
thread, saying, This came out first.
29 And it came to pass, as he drew
back his hand, that, behold, his
brother came out: and she said,
How hast thou broken forth? this
breach be upon thee: therefore his
name was called a Pharez.

30 And afterward came out his
brother, that had the scarlet thread
upon his hand: and his name was
called a Zarah.

CHAPTER 39

Joseph, prospered by the Lord, becomes
ruler of Potiphar’s house—He resists the
advances of Potiphar’s wife, is falsely
accused, and is cast into prison—The
keeper of the prison commits the prison’s
affairs into Joseph’s hands.

AND Joseph was brought down to
Egypt; and a Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an
Egyptian, bought him of the hands
of the b Ishmeelites, which had
brought him down thither.

and he was a prosperous man; and
he was in the house of his master
the Egyptian.

3 And his master saw that the LORD
was with him, and that the LORD
made all that he did to a prosper
in his hand.

4 And Joseph found grace in his
sight, and he served him: and he
made him overseer over his house,
and all that he had he put into his
hand.

5 And it came to pass from the
time that he had made him overseer
in his house, and over all that
he had, that the LORD blessed the
Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s a sake;
and the blessing of the LORD was
upon all that he had in the house,
and in the field.

6 And he left all that he had in Joseph’s
hand; and he knew not ought
he had, save the bread which he
did eat. And Joseph was a a goodly
person, and well b favoured.

7 ¶ And it came to pass after these
things, that his master’s wife cast
her a eyes upon Joseph; and she said,
Lie with me.

8 But he a refused, and said unto
his master’s wife, Behold, my master
b wotteth not what is with me in
the house, and he hath c committed
all that he hath to my hand;

9 There is none greater in this
house than I; neither hath he kept
back any thing from me but thee,
because thou art his wife: how then
can I do this great a wickedness, and
b sin against God?

10 And it came to pass, as she
spake to Joseph a day by day, that
he hearkened not unto her, to lie
by her, or to be with her.

11 And it came to pass about this
time, that Joseph went into the
house to do his business; and there

was none of the men of the house
there within.

12 And she caught him by his garment,
saying, Lie with me: and he
left his garment in her hand, and
a fled, and got him out.

13 And it came to pass, when she
saw that he had left his garment in
her hand, and was fled forth,

14 That she called unto the men
of her house, and spake unto them,
saying, See, he hath brought in an
Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came
in unto me to lie with me, and I
cried with a loud voice:

15 And it came to pass, when he
heard that I lifted up my voice and
cried, that he left his garment with
me, and fled, and got him out.

16 And she laid up his garment
by her, until his lord came home.
17 And she spake unto him according
to these words, saying, The
Hebrew servant, which thou hast
brought unto us, came in unto me
to mock me:

18 And it came to pass, as I lifted
up my voice and cried, that he left
his garment with me, and fled out.
19 And it came to pass, when
his master heard the words of his
wife, which she spake unto him,
saying, After this manner did thy
servant to me; that his wrath was
kindled.

20 And Joseph’s master took him,
and put him into the a prison, a
place where the king’s prisoners
were bound: and he was there in
the prison.

21 ¶ But the a LORD was with Joseph,
and shewed him mercy, and
gave him favour in the sight of the
keeper of the prison.

22 And the keeper of the prison
committed to Joseph’s hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison; and

CHAPTER 40

Joseph interprets the dreams of Pharaoh’s
chief butler and chief baker—The
butler fails to tell Pharaoh about Joseph.
AND it came to pass after these
things, that the butler of the king of
Egypt and his baker had offended
their lord the king of Egypt.

2 And Pharaoh was wroth against
two of his officers, against the chief
of the butlers, and against the chief
of the bakers.

3 And he put them in ward in the
house of the captain of the guard,
into the a prison, the place where
Joseph was bound.

4 And the captain of the guard
charged Joseph with them, and he
served them: and they continued a
season in ward.

5 ¶ And they dreamed a dream
both of them, each man his dream
in one night, each man according
to the interpretation of his dream,
the butler and the baker of the
king of Egypt, which were bound
in the prison.

6 And Joseph came in unto them
in the morning, and looked upon
them, and, behold, they were sad.

7 And he asked Pharaoh’s officers
that were with him in the ward of
his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore
look ye so sadly to day ?

8 And they said unto him, We
have dreamed a a dream, and there
is no interpreter of it. And Joseph
said unto them, Do not b interpretations
belong to God? tell me them,
I pray you.

9 And the chief butler told his
dream to Joseph, and said to him,

In my dream, behold, a vine was
before me;

10 And in the vine were three
branches: and it was as though it
budded, and her blossoms shot forth;
and the clusters thereof brought
forth ripe grapes:

11 And Pharaoh’s cup was in my
hand: and I took the grapes, and
pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and
I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.

12 And Joseph said unto him, This
is the interpretation of it: The three
branches are three days:

13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh
lift up thine head, and restore
thee unto thy place: and thou shalt
deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand,
after the former manner when thou
wast his butler.

14 But think on me when it shall
be well with thee, and shew kindness,
I pray thee, unto me, and make
mention of me unto Pharaoh, and
bring me out of this house:

15 For indeed I was stolen away
out of the land of the Hebrews:
and here also have I done nothing
that they should put me into the
dungeon.

16 When the chief baker saw that
the interpretation was good, he said
unto Joseph, I also was in my dream,
and, behold, I had three white baskets
on my head:

17 And in the uppermost basket
there was of all manner of bakemeats
for Pharaoh; and the birds
did eat them out of the basket upon
my head.

18 And Joseph answered and said,
This is the interpretation thereof:
The three baskets are three days:

19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh
lift up thy head from off thee,
and shall hang thee on a tree; and
the birds shall eat thy flesh from
off thee.

20 ¶ And it came to pass the third
day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday,
that he made a feast unto all his

servants: and he lifted up the head
of the chief butler and of the chief
baker among his servants.

21 And he restored the chief butler
unto his butlership again; and he
gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:

22 But he hanged the chief baker:
as Joseph had interpreted to them.
23 Yet did not the chief butler remember
Joseph, but a forgat him.

Manasseh and Ephraim—Joseph sells
grain to Egyptians and others during
the famine.

AND it came to pass at the end of two
full years, that Pharaoh a dreamed:
and, behold, he stood by the river.
2 And, behold, there came up out
of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed; and they fed
in a meadow.

3 And, behold, seven other kine
came up after them out of the river,
ill favoured and leanfleshed; and
stood by the other kine upon the
brink of the river.

4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed
kine did eat up the seven
well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh
awoke.

5 And he slept and dreamed the
second time: and, behold, seven ears
of corn came up upon one stalk,
rank and good.

6 And, behold, seven thin ears and
blasted with the east wind sprung
up after them.

7 And the seven thin ears devoured
the seven rank and full ears. And
Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was
a dream.

8 And it came to pass in the morning
that his spirit was a troubled; and
he sent and called for all the b magicians
of Egypt, and all the wise
men thereof: and Pharaoh told them
his dream; but there was none that
could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
9 ¶ Then spake the chief butler
unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember
my faults this day:

10 Pharaoh was wroth with his
servants, and put me in ward in
the captain of the guard’s house,
both me and the chief baker:

11 And we dreamed a dream in
one night, I and he; we dreamed
each man according to the interpretation
of his dream.

12 And there was there with us a
young man, an Hebrew, servant to
the captain of the guard; and we
told him, and he interpreted to us
our dreams; to each man according
to his dream he did interpret.

13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted
to us, so it was; me he restored
unto mine office, and him
he hanged.

14 ¶ Then a Pharaoh sent and called
Joseph, and they brought him hastily
out of the b dungeon: and he
shaved himself, and changed his raiment,
and came in unto Pharaoh.

15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
I have dreamed a dream, and there
is none that can interpret it: and I
have heard say of thee, that thou
canst understand a dream to a interpret
it.

16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh,
saying, It is not in me: a God shall
give Pharaoh an answer of b peace.
17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
In my dream, behold, I stood upon
the bank of the river:

18 And, behold, there came up out
of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
and well favoured; and they fed in
a meadow:

19 And, behold, seven other kine
came up after them, poor and very

ill favoured and leanfleshed, such
as I never saw in all the land of
Egypt for badness:

20 And the lean and the ill favoured
kine did eat up the first
seven fat kine:

21 And when they had eaten them
up, it could not be known that they
had eaten them; but they were still
ill favoured, as at the beginning.
So I awoke.

22 And I saw in my dream, and,
behold, seven ears came up in one
stalk, full and good:

23 And, behold, seven ears, withered,
thin, and blasted with the
a east b wind, sprung up after them:
24 And the thin ears devoured the
seven good ears: and I told this unto
the magicians; but there was none
that could declare it to me.

25 ¶ And Joseph said unto Pharaoh,
The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
hath a shewed Pharaoh what he is
about to do.

26 The seven good kine are seven
years; and the seven good ears are
seven years: the dream is one.

27 And the seven thin and ill favoured
kine that came up after them
are seven years; and the seven empty
ears blasted with the east wind shall
be seven years of a famine.

28 This is the thing which I have
spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
is about to do he sheweth unto
Pharaoh.

29 Behold, there come seven years
of great plenty throughout all the
land of Egypt:

30 And there shall arise after
them seven years of famine; and
all the plenty shall be forgotten in
the land of Egypt; and the a famine
shall consume the land;

31 And the plenty shall not be
known in the land by reason of

that famine following; for it shall
be very grievous.

32 And for that the dream was
doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
because the thing is established by
God, and God will shortly bring it
to pass.

33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look
out a man discreet and wise, and set
him over the land of Egypt.

34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him
appoint officers over the land, and
take up the fifth part of the land of
Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
35 And let them gather all the
food of those good years that come,
and lay up corn under the hand of
Pharaoh, and let them keep food
in the cities.

36 And that food shall be for a store
to the land against the seven years
of famine, which shall be in the
land of Egypt; that the land perish
not through the famine.

37 ¶ And the thing was a good in
the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
of all his servants.

38 And Pharaoh said unto his
servants, Can we find such a one as
this is, a man in whom the a Spirit
of God is?

39 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Forasmuch as God hath a shewed
thee all this, there is none so discreet
and b wise as thou art:

40 Thou shalt be a over my house,
and according unto thy word shall
all my people be ruled: only in the
throne will I be b greater than thou.
41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
See, I have a set thee over all the
land of Egypt.

42 And Pharaoh took off his a ring
from his hand, and put it upon
Joseph’s hand, and b arrayed him
in c vestures of fine linen, and put
a gold chain about his neck;

43 And he made him to ride in
the second chariot which he had;
and they cried before him, Bow the
knee: and he made him a ruler over
all the land of Egypt.

44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I
am Pharaoh, and without thee shall
no man lift up his hand or foot in
all the land of Egypt.

45 And Pharaoh called Joseph’s
name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he
gave him to wife a Asenath the
daughter of Poti-pherah b priest of
On. And Joseph went out over all
the land of Egypt.

46 ¶ And a Joseph was thirty years
old when he stood before Pharaoh
king of Egypt. And Joseph went out
from the presence of Pharaoh, and
went throughout all the land of Egypt.
47 And in the seven plenteous
years the earth brought forth by
handfuls.

48 And he gathered up all the a food
of the seven years, which were in
the land of Egypt, and laid up the
food in the cities: the food of the
field, which was round about every
city, laid he up in the same.

49 And Joseph gathered corn as
the sand of the sea, very much,
until he left numbering; for it was
without number.

50 And unto Joseph were born
two sons before the years of famine
came, which Asenath the daughter
of Poti-pherah priest of On bare
unto him.

51 And Joseph called the name of
the firstborn a Manasseh: For God,
said he, hath made me forget all
my toil, and all my father’s house.
52 And the name of the second
called he a Ephraim: For God hath
caused me to be b fruitful in the
land of my affliction.

53 ¶ And the seven years of plenteousness,
that was in the land of
Egypt, were ended.

54 And the seven years of a dearth
began to come, according as Joseph
had said: and the dearth was in all
lands; but in all the land of Egypt
there was bread.

55 And when all the land of Egypt
was famished, the people cried to
Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh
said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

56 And the famine was over all
the face of the earth: And Joseph
opened all the storehouses, and a sold
unto the Egyptians; and the famine
waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

57 And all countries came into
Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
that the famine was so sore
in all lands.

CHAPTER 42

Jacob sends his sons to buy grain in
Egypt—They bow before Joseph—He
makes harsh accusations against them,
imprisons Simeon, and sends them back
for Benjamin.

NOW when Jacob saw that there
was a corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto
his sons, Why do ye look one upon
another?

2 And he said, Behold, I have
heard that there is corn in Egypt:
get you down thither, and buy for
us from thence; that we may live,
and not die.

3 ¶ And Joseph’s ten brethren went
down to buy a corn in Egypt.

4 But a Benjamin, Joseph’s brother,
Jacob sent not with his brethren; for
he said, Lest peradventure mischief
befall him.

5 And the sons of Israel came to buy
corn among those that came: for the
famine was in the land of Canaan.

6 And Joseph was the a governor
over the land, and he it was that sold
to all the people of the land: and
Joseph’s brethren came, and b bowed
down themselves before him with
their faces to the earth.

7 And Joseph saw his brethren,
and he knew them, but made himself
strange unto them, and spake
roughly unto them; and he said
unto them, Whence come ye? And
they said, From the land of Canaan
to buy food.

8 And Joseph knew his brethren,
but they knew not him.

9 And Joseph remembered the
a dreams which he dreamed of them,
and said unto them, Ye are spies;
to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come.

10 And they said unto him, Nay,
my lord, but to buy food are thy
servants come.

11 We are all one a man’s sons; we
are true men, thy servants are no
spies.

12 And he said unto them, Nay,
but to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come.

13 And they said, Thy servants are
twelve brethren, the sons of one man
in the land of Canaan; and, behold,
the youngest is this day with our
father, and one is a not.

14 And Joseph said unto them,
That is it that I spake unto you,
saying, Ye are spies:

15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By
the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
forth hence, except your youngest
brother come hither.

16 Send one of you, and let him
fetch your brother, and ye shall
be kept in prison, that your words
may be proved, whether there be any
truth in you: or else by the life of
Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

17 And he put them all together
into ward three days.

18 And Joseph said unto them the

third day, This do, and live; for I
a fear God:

19 If ye be true men, let one of your
brethren be bound in the house of
your prison: go ye, carry corn for
the famine of your houses:

20 But bring your youngest brother
unto me; so shall your words be
verified, and ye shall not die. And
they did so.

21 ¶ And they said one to another,
We are verily a guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the anguish
of his soul, when he besought us,
and we would not hear; therefore
is this distress come upon us.

22 And a Reuben answered them,
saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,
Do not sin against the child;
and ye would not hear? therefore,
behold, also his b blood is required.
23 And they knew not that Joseph
understood them; for he spake unto
them by an interpreter.

24 And he turned himself about
from them, and a wept; and returned
to them again, and communed with
them, and took from them Simeon,
and bound him before their eyes.
25 ¶ Then Joseph commanded to
fill their sacks with corn, and to restore
every man’s a money into his
sack, and to give them provision for
the way: and thus did he unto them.
26 And they laded their asses with
the corn, and departed thence.

27 And as one of them opened his
sack to give his ass provender in
the inn, he espied his a money; for,
behold, it was in his sack’s mouth.
28 And he said unto his brethren,
My money is restored; and, lo, it is
even in my sack: and their heart
failed them, and they were afraid,
saying one to another, What is this
that God hath done unto us?

29 ¶ And they came unto Jacob
their father unto the land of Canaan,
and told him all that befell
unto them; saying,

30 The man, who is the lord of the
land, spake roughly to us, and took
us for spies of the country.

31 And we said unto him, We are
true men; we are no spies:

32 We be twelve brethren, sons
of our father; one is not, and the
youngest is this day with our father
in the land of Canaan.

33 And the man, the lord of the
country, said unto us, Hereby shall
I know that ye are true men; leave
one of your brethren here with me,
and take food for the famine of your
households, and be gone:

34 And bring your youngest
brother unto me: then shall I know
that ye are no spies, but that ye are
true men: so will I deliver you your
brother, and ye shall traffick in the
land.

35 ¶ And it came to pass as they
emptied their sacks, that, behold,
every man’s bundle of money was
in his sack: and when both they
and their father saw the bundles
of money, they were afraid.

36 And Jacob their father said unto
them, Me have ye bereaved of my
children: Joseph is not, and Simeon
is not, and ye will take a Benjamin
away: all these things are against me.

37 And a Reuben spake unto his
father, saying, Slay my two sons,
if I bring him not to thee: deliver
him into my hand, and I will bring
him to thee again.

38 And he said, My son shall not
go down with you; for his brother
is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief
befall him by the way in the
which ye go, then shall ye bring
down my gray hairs with a sorrow
to the grave.

CHAPTER 43

Jacob is persuaded to send Benjamin to
Egypt—Joseph’s brothers show respect to
him—They all eat and drink together.
AND the famine was sore in the land.

2 And it came to pass, when they

had eaten up the corn which they
had brought out of Egypt, their
father said unto them, Go again,
buy us a little food.

3 And Judah spake unto him, saying,
The man did solemnly protest
unto us, saying, Ye shall not see
my face, except your a brother be
with you.

4 If thou wilt send our brother
with us, we will go down and buy
thee food:

5 But if thou wilt not send him, we
will not go down: for the man said
unto us, Ye shall not see my face,
except your a brother be with you.

6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt
ye so ill with me, as to tell the man
whether ye had yet a brother?

7 And they said, The man asked
us straitly of our state, and of our
kindred, saying, Is your father yet
alive? have ye another brother? and
we told him according to the tenor
of these words: could we certainly
know that he would say, Bring your
brother down?

8 And Judah said unto Israel his
father, Send the lad with me, and
we will arise and go; that we may
live, and not die, both we, and thou,
and also our little ones.

9 I will be surety for him; of my
hand shalt thou require him: if I
bring him not unto thee, and set
him before thee, then let me bear
the a blame for ever:

10 For except we had lingered,
surely now we had returned this
second time.

11 And their father Israel said unto
them, If it must be so now, do this;
take of the best fruits in the land
in your vessels, and carry down the
man a present, a little balm, and
a little honey, spices, and myrrh,
nuts, and almonds:

12 And take double money in your
hand; and the a money that was
brought again in the mouth of your
sacks, carry it again in your hand;
peradventure it was an oversight:

13 Take also your brother, and
arise, go again unto the man:

14 And God Almighty give you
mercy before the man, that he may
send away your other brother, and
Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my
children, I am bereaved.

15 ¶ And the men took that present,
and they took double money
in their hand, and Benjamin; and
rose up, and went down to Egypt,
and stood before Joseph.

16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin
with them, he said to the ruler of
his house, Bring these men home,
and slay, and make ready; for these
men shall dine with me at noon.

17 And the man did as Joseph bade;
and the man brought the men into
Joseph’s house.

18 And the men were afraid, because
they were brought into Joseph’s
house; and they said, Because
of the money that was returned
in our sacks at the first time are
we brought in; that he may seek
occasion against us, and fall upon
us, and take us for bondmen, and
our asses.

19 And they came near to the
steward of Joseph’s house, and they
communed with him at the door of
the house,

20 And said, O a sir, we came indeed
down at the first time to buy b food:

21 And it came to pass, when we
came to the inn, that we opened
our sacks, and, behold, every man’s
a money was in the mouth of his sack,
our money in full weight: and we
have brought it again in our hand.

22 And other money have we
brought down in our hands to buy
food: we cannot tell who put our
money in our sacks.

23 And he said, Peace be to you,
fear not: your God, and the God of
your father, hath given you treasure
in your sacks: I had your money.
And he brought Simeon out unto
them.

24 And the man brought the men
into Joseph’s house, and gave them
water, and they a washed their
feet; and he gave their asses provender.25
And they made ready the present
against Joseph came at noon:
for they heard that they should eat
bread there.

26 ¶ And when Joseph came home,
they brought him the present which
was in their hand into the house,
and a bowed themselves to him to
the earth.

27 And he asked them of their welfare,
and said, Is your father well,
the old a man of whom ye spake? Is
he yet alive?

28 And they answered, Thy servant
our father is in good health, he is
yet alive. And they bowed down
their heads, and made obeisance.

29 And he lifted up his eyes, and
saw his brother a Benjamin, his
mother’s son, and said, Is this your
younger brother, of whom ye spake
unto me? And he said, God be gracious
unto thee, my son.

30 And Joseph made haste; for his
bowels did yearn upon his brother:
and he sought where to weep; and
he entered into his chamber, and
a wept there.

31 And he washed his face, and
went out, and refrained himself,
and said, Set on bread.

32 And they set on for him by
himself, and for them by themselves,
and for the Egyptians, which
did eat with him, by themselves:
because the Egyptians might not
eat bread with the Hebrews; for
that is an a abomination unto the
Egyptians.

33 And they sat before him, the
firstborn according to his a birthright,
and the youngest according
to his youth: and the men marvelled
one at another.

34 And he took and sent a messes
unto them from before him: but

b Benjamin’s mess was five times
so much as any of theirs. And they
drank, and were merry with him.

CHAPTER 44

Joseph arranges to stop the return of
his brothers to Canaan—Judah offers
himself in place of Benjamin for their
father’s sake.

AND he commanded the steward
of his house, saying, Fill the men’s
sacks with food, as much as they can
carry, and put every man’s money
in his sack’s mouth.

2 And put my cup, the silver cup,
in the sack’s mouth of the youngest,
and his corn money. And he did
according to the word that Joseph
had spoken.

3 As soon as the morning was light,
the men were sent away, they and
their asses.

4 And when they were gone out
of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph
said unto his steward, Up, follow
after the men; and when thou
dost overtake them, say unto them,
Wherefore have ye rewarded evil
for good?

5 Is not this it in which my lord
drinketh, and whereby indeed he
divineth? ye have done evil in so
doing.

6 ¶ And he overtook them, and he
spake unto them these same words.
7 And they said unto him, Wherefore
saith my lord these words? God
forbid that thy servants should do
according to this thing:

8 Behold, the money, which we
found in our sacks’ mouths, we
brought again unto thee out of the
land of Canaan: how then should
we steal out of thy lord’s house silver
or gold?

9 With whomsoever of thy servants
it be found, both let him die, and
we also will be my lord’s bondmen.

10 And he said, Now also let it
be according unto your words: he

with whom it is found shall be my
servant; and ye shall be blameless.

11 Then they speedily took down
every man his sack to the ground,
and opened every man his sack.

12 And he searched, and began at
the eldest, and left at the youngest:
and the cup was found in Benjamin’s
sack.

13 Then they a rent their clothes,
and laded every man his ass, and
returned to the city.

14 ¶ And Judah and his brethren
came to Joseph’s house; for he was
yet there: and they a fell before him
on the ground.

15 And Joseph said unto them,
What deed is this that ye have done?
wot ye not that such a man as I can
certainly divine?

16 And Judah said, What shall we
say unto my lord? what shall we
speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?
God hath found out the iniquity
of thy servants: behold, we
are my lord’s servants, both we, and
he also with whom the cup is found.

17 And he said, God forbid that I
should do so: but the man in whose
hand the cup is found, he shall be
my servant; and as for you, get you
up in peace unto your father.

18 ¶ Then Judah came near unto
him, and said, Oh my a lord, let thy
servant, I pray thee, speak a word
in my lord’s ears, and let not thine
b anger burn against thy servant: for
thou art even as Pharaoh.

19 My lord asked his servants, saying,
Have ye a father, or a brother?

20 And we said unto my lord, We
have a father, an old a man, and a

his brother is dead, and he alone
is left of his mother, and his father

21 And thou saidst unto thy servants,
Bring him down unto me,
that I may set mine eyes upon him.
22 And we said unto my lord, The
lad cannot leave his father: for if he

should leave his father, his father
would die.

23 And thou saidst unto thy servants,
Except your youngest a brother
come down with you, ye shall see
my face no more.

24 And it came to pass when we
came up unto thy servant my father,
we told him the words of my lord.
25 And our father said, Go again,
and buy us a little food.

26 And we said, We cannot go
down: if our youngest brother be
with us, then will we go down: for
we may not see the man’s face, except
our a youngest brother be with
us.

27 And thy servant my father said
unto us, Ye know that my wife bare
me two sons:

28 And the one went out from
me, and I said, Surely he is a torn
in b pieces; and I saw him not since:
29 And if ye a take this also from
me, and mischief befall b him, ye
shall bring down my gray hairs with
sorrow to the grave.

30 Now therefore when I come to
thy servant my father, and the lad
be not with us; seeing that his life
is a bound up in the lad’s life;

31 It shall come to pass, when he
seeth that the lad is not with us, that
he will die: and thy servants shall
bring down the gray hairs of thy
servant our father with a sorrow to
the grave.

32 For thy servant became surety
for the lad unto my father, saying,
If I bring him not unto thee, then I
shall bear the a blame to my father
for ever.

33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let
thy servant abide instead of the lad
a bondman to my lord; and let the
lad go up with his brethren.

34 For how shall I go up to my

father, and the lad be not with me?
lest peradventure I see the evil that
shall come on my father.

CHAPTER 45

Joseph makes himself known to his
brothers—They rejoice together—Pharaoh
invites Jacob and his family to
dwell in Egypt and eat the fat of the land.
THEN Joseph could not a refrain
himself before all them that stood
by him; and he b cried, Cause every
man to go out from me. And there
stood no man with him, while Joseph
made himself known unto his
brethren.

2 And he wept aloud: and the
Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
heard.

3 And Joseph said unto his brethren,
I am a Joseph; doth my father
yet live? And his brethren could not
answer him; for they were b troubled
at his presence.

4 And Joseph said unto his brethren,
Come near to me, I pray you.
And they came near. And he said,
I am a Joseph your brother, whom
ye sold into Egypt.

5 Now therefore be not a grieved,
nor angry with yourselves, that ye
sold me hither: for God did b send
me before you to preserve life.

6 For these two years hath the famine
been in the land: and yet there
are five years, in the which there
shall neither be earing nor harvest.
7 And God sent me before you to
a preserve you a b posterity in the
earth, and to save your lives by a
great deliverance.

8 So now it was not you that sent
me hither, but God: and he hath
made me a father to Pharaoh, and
lord of all his house, and a a ruler
throughout all the land of Egypt.

9 Haste ye, and go up to my father,
and say unto him, Thus saith thy
son Joseph, God hath made me lord
of all Egypt: come down unto me,
tarry not:

10 And thou shalt dwell in the
land of a Goshen, and thou shalt be
near unto me, thou, and thy children,
and thy children’s children,
and thy flocks, and thy herds, and
all that thou hast:

11 And there will I a nourish thee;
for yet there are five years of famine;
lest thou, and thy household, and
all that thou hast, come to poverty.
12 And, behold, your eyes see, and
the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
that it is my mouth that speaketh
unto you.

13 And ye shall tell my father of
all my glory in Egypt, and of all
that ye have seen; and ye shall haste
and bring down my a father hither.
14 And he fell upon his brother
Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and
Benjamin wept upon his neck.

15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren,
and wept upon them: and after
that his brethren talked with
him.

16 ¶ And the fame thereof was
heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying,
Joseph’s brethren are come: and
it a pleased Pharaoh well, and his
servants.

17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
lade your beasts, and go, get you
unto the land of Canaan;

18 And take your father and your
households, and come unto me: and
I will give you the good of the land
of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
of the land.

19 Now thou art commanded, this
do ye; take you a wagons out of the
land of Egypt for your little ones,
and for your wives, and bring your
father, and come.

20 Also regard not your stuff; for

the good of all the land of Egypt
is yours.

21 And the children of Israel did
so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
according to the commandment of
Pharaoh, and gave them provision
for the way.

22 To all of them he gave each man
changes of raiment; but to a Benjamin
he gave three hundred pieces of
silver, and five changes of raiment.

23 And to his father he sent after
this manner; ten asses laden with
the good things of Egypt, and ten
she asses laden with corn and bread
and meat for his father by the way.
24 So he sent his brethren away,
and they departed: and he said unto
them, See that ye fall not out by
the way.

25 ¶ And they went up out of
Egypt, and came into the land of
Canaan unto Jacob their father,

26 And told him, saying, Joseph
is yet alive, and he is a governor over
all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s
heart fainted, for he believed them
not.

27 And they told him all the words
of Joseph, which he had said unto
them: and when he saw the a wagons
which Joseph had sent to carry
him, the spirit of Jacob their father
b revived:

28 And Israel said, It is enough;
Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go
and see him before I die.

CHAPTER 46

The Lord sends Jacob and his family of
seventy souls to Egypt—The descendants
of Jacob are named—Joseph meets Jacob.
AND Israel took his journey with
all that he had, and came to a Beersheba,
and offered sacrifices unto
the God of his father Isaac.

2 And God spake unto Israel in the
a visions of the night, and said, Jacob,
Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

3 And he said, I am God, the God
of thy a father: fear not to go down
into b Egypt; for I will there make
of thee a great c nation:

4 a I will go down with thee into
Egypt; and I will also surely b bring
thee up again: and c Joseph shall put

5 And Jacob a rose up from Beersheba:
and the sons of Israel carried
Jacob their father, and their
little ones, and their wives, in the
b wagons which Pharaoh had sent
to carry him.

6 And they took their cattle, and
their goods, which they had gotten
in the land of Canaan, and came
into a Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed
with him:

7 His sons, and his sons’ sons with
him, his daughters, and his sons’
daughters, and all his a seed brought
he with him into Egypt.

8 ¶ And these are the a names of the
b children of Israel, which came into
Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben,
Jacob’s firstborn.

9 And the sons of a Reuben; Hanoch,
and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

Kohath, and Merari.

12 ¶ And the sons of Judah; a Er,
and b Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,
and c Zerah: but Er and Onan died
in the land of Canaan. And the
sons of Pharez were Hezron and
Hamul.

13 ¶ And the sons of a Issachar;
Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
Shimron.

14 ¶ And the sons of Zebulun;
Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
15 These be the sons of a Leah,
which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram,
with his daughter Dinah: all
the souls of his sons and his daughters
were thirty and three.

16 ¶ And the sons of a Gad; Ziphion,
and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,
and Arodi, and Areli.

17 ¶ And the sons of Asher; Jimnah,
and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,
and Serah their sister: and
the sons of Beriah; Heber, and
Malchiel.

18 These are the sons of a Zilpah,
whom Laban gave to Leah his
daughter, and these she bare unto
Jacob, even sixteen souls.

19 The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife;
Joseph, and a Benjamin.

20 ¶ And unto Joseph in the land
of Egypt were born a Manasseh
and Ephraim, which b Asenath the
daughter of Poti-pherah priest of
On bare unto him.

21 ¶ And the sons of a Benjamin
were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and
Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and
Ard.

22 These are the sons of Rachel,
which were born to Jacob: all the
souls were fourteen.

25 These are the sons of a Bilhah,
which Laban gave unto Rachel his

of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’

and six;

27 And the sons of Joseph, which
were born him in Egypt, were two
souls: all the souls of the house of
a Jacob, which came into Egypt, were
b threescore and ten.

28 ¶ And he sent Judah before
him unto Joseph, to direct his face
unto Goshen; and they came into
the land of a Goshen.

29 And Joseph made ready his
chariot, and went up to meet Israel
his father, to Goshen, and presented
himself unto him; and he fell on
his neck, and a wept on his neck a
good while.

30 And Israel said unto Joseph,
Now let me die, since I have seen
thy face, because thou art yet alive.
31 And Joseph said unto his brethren,
and unto his father’s house, I
will go up, and shew a Pharaoh, and
say unto him, My brethren, and my
father’s house, which were in the
land of Canaan, are come unto me;

32 And the men are shepherds,
for their trade hath been to feed
cattle; and they have brought their
flocks, and their herds, and all that
they have.

33 And it shall come to pass, when
Pharaoh shall call you, and shall
say, What is your a occupation?

34 That ye shall say, Thy servants’
trade hath been about a cattle from
our youth even until now, both we,
and also our fathers: that ye may
dwell in the land of Goshen; for
every shepherd is an b abomination
unto the Egyptians.

CHAPTER 47

The Israelites settle in Goshen—Jacob
blesses Pharaoh—Joseph sells grain to
the Egyptians—Pharaoh receives the
Egyptians’ cattle and lands—Jacob

desires to be buried with his fathers
in Canaan.

THEN Joseph came and told a Pharaoh,
and said, My father and my
brethren, and their flocks, and their
herds, and all that they have, are
come out of the land of Canaan;
and, behold, they are in the land
of b Goshen.

2 And he took some of his brethren,
even five men, and presented
them unto a Pharaoh.

3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren,
What is your a occupation? And
they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants
are b shepherds, both we, and
also our fathers.

4 They said moreover unto Pharaoh,
For to a sojourn in the land
are we come; for thy servants have
no pasture for their flocks; for the
famine is sore in the land of Canaan:
now therefore, we pray thee,
let thy servants dwell in the land
of Goshen.

5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph,
saying, Thy father and thy brethren
are come unto thee:

6 The land of a Egypt is before
thee; in the best of the land make
thy father and brethren to dwell; in
the land of Goshen let them dwell:
and if thou knowest any men of activity
among them, then make them
rulers over my cattle.

7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his
father, and set him before Pharaoh:
and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob,
How old art thou?

9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh,
The days of the years of my a pilgrimage
are an hundred and thirty
years: few and b evil have the days of
the years of my life been, and have
not attained unto the c days of the
years of the life of my fathers in
the days of their pilgrimage.

10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
and went out from before Pharaoh.

11 ¶ And Joseph placed his father
and his brethren, and gave them
a possession in the land of Egypt,
in the best of the land, in the land
of a Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.12
And Joseph a nourished his
father, and his brethren, and all
his father’s household, with bread,
according to their families.

13 ¶ And there was no bread in all
the land; for the a famine was very
sore, so that the land of Egypt and
all the land of Canaan fainted by
reason of the famine.

14 And Joseph gathered up all
the a money that was found in the
land of Egypt, and in the land of
Canaan, for the corn which they
bought: and Joseph brought the
money into Pharaoh’s house.

15 And when money failed in the
land of Egypt, and in the land of
Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto
Joseph, and said, Give us a bread: for
why should we die in thy presence?
for the money faileth.

16 And Joseph said, Give your
cattle; and I will give you for your
cattle, if money fail.

17 And they brought their cattle
unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
bread in exchange for horses, and for
the flocks, and for the cattle of the
herds, and for the asses: and he fed
them with bread for all their cattle
for that year.

18 When that year was ended, they
came unto him the second year, and
said unto him, We will not hide it
from my lord, how that our money
is spent; my lord also hath our herds
of cattle; there is not ought left in
the sight of my lord, but our bodies,
and our lands:

19 Wherefore shall we die before
thine eyes, both we and our land?
buy us and our land for bread, and

we and our land will be servants
unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that
we may live, and not die, that the
land be not desolate.

20 And Joseph bought all the
land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for
the Egyptians sold every man his
field, because the famine prevailed
over them: so the land became
Pharaoh’s.

21 And as for the people, a he removed
them to cities from one end
of the borders of Egypt even to the
other end thereof.

22 Only the land of the a priests
bought he not; for the priests had
a portion assigned them of Pharaoh,
and did eat their portion which
Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they
sold not their lands.

23 Then Joseph said unto the people,
Behold, I have bought you this
day and your land for Pharaoh: lo,
here is seed for you, and ye shall
sow the land.

24 And it shall come to pass a in
the increase, that ye shall give the
b fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four
parts shall be your own, for seed of
the field, and for your food, and for
them of your households, and for
food for your little ones.

25 And they said, Thou hast saved
our lives: let us find grace in the
sight of my lord, and we will be
Pharaoh’s servants.

26 And Joseph made it a law over
the land of Egypt unto this day, that
Pharaoh should have the fifth part;
except the land of the a priests only,
which became not Pharaoh’s.

27 ¶ And Israel dwelt in the land
of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;
and they had possessions therein,
and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.28
And Jacob lived in the land of
Egypt seventeen years: so the whole
age of a Jacob was an hundred forty
and seven years.

29 And the a time drew nigh that
Israel must die: and he called his

now I have found grace in thy sight,
put, I pray thee, thy hand under my
b thigh, and deal kindly and truly
with me; c bury me not, I pray thee,
in Egypt:

30 But I will lie with my fathers,
and thou shalt carry me out of
Egypt, and a bury me in their buryingplace.
And he said, I will do as
thou hast said.

31 And he said, Swear unto me.
And he sware unto him. And Israel
a bowed himself b upon the c bed’s

CHAPTER 48

Jacob tells of the appearance of God to
him in Luz—He adopts Ephraim and
Manasseh as his own children—Jacob
blesses Joseph—He puts Ephraim before
Manasseh—The seed of Ephraim will
become a multitude of nations—The
children of Israel will come again into
the land of their fathers.

AND it came to pass after these
things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
thy father is sick: and he took with
him his two sons, Manasseh and
Ephraim.

2 And one told a Jacob, and said,
Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
thee: and Israel b strengthened himself,
and sat upon the bed.

3 And Jacob said unto Joseph,
God a Almighty b appeared unto me
at c Luz in the land of Canaan, and
blessed me,

4 And said unto me, Behold, I will
make thee a fruitful, and multiply
thee, and I will make of thee a multitude
of people; and will give this

b land to thy seed after thee for an
everlasting c possession.

5 ¶ a And now thy two sons,
b Ephraim and c Manasseh, which
were born unto thee in the land
of Egypt before I came unto thee
into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and
Simeon, they shall be mine.

6 And thy issue, which thou begettest
after them, shall be thine, and
shall be called after the name of
their brethren in their inheritance.

7 And as for me, when I came
from Padan, a Rachel died by me
in the land of Canaan in the way,
when yet there was but a little way
to come unto Ephrath: and I buried
her there in the way of Ephrath;
the same is Beth-lehem.

8 And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons,
and said, Who are these?

9 And Joseph said unto his father,
They are my sons, whom God hath
given me in this place. And he said,
Bring them, I pray thee, unto me,
and I will a bless them.

10 Now the eyes of Israel were
a dim for age, so that he could not
see. And he brought them b near
unto him; and he kissed them, and
embraced them.

11 And Israel said unto Joseph,
I had not thought to see thy face:
and, lo, God hath shewed me also
thy seed.

12 And Joseph brought them out
from between his knees, and he
bowed himself with his face to
the earth.

13 And Joseph took them both,
Ephraim in his right hand toward
Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in
his left hand toward Israel’s right
hand, and brought them near unto
him.

b guiding his hands wittingly; for
Manasseh was the firstborn.

15 ¶ And he blessed a Joseph, and
said, God, before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac did b walk, the
God which c fed me all my life long
unto this day,

16 The a Angel which redeemed me
from all evil, bless the lads; and let
my b name be named on them, and
the name of my fathers Abraham
and Isaac; and let them grow into a
multitude in the midst of the earth.
17 And when Joseph saw that his
father laid his right a hand upon the
head of b Ephraim, c it displeased
him: and he held up his father’s
hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s
head unto Manasseh’s head.

18 And Joseph said unto his father,
Not so, my father: for this is the
firstborn; put thy right hand upon
his head.

19 And his father refused, and
said, I know it, my son, I know it:
he also shall become a people, and
he also shall be a great: but truly his
younger brother shall be greater
than he, and his b seed shall become
a c multitude of d nations.

20 And he blessed them that
day, saying, a In thee shall Israel
b bless, saying, God make thee as
Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he
set c Ephraim before Manasseh.

21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold,
I die: but a God shall be with
you, and b bring you again unto the
c land of your fathers.

22 Moreover I have given to thee
one a portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of the
Amorite with my sword and with
my bow.

CHAPTER 49

Jacob blesses his sons and their seed—
Reuben, Simeon, and Levi are chastened—
Judah will rule until Shiloh (Christ)
comes—Joseph is a fruitful bough by a
well—His branches (the Nephites and
Lamanites) will run over the wall—The
Shepherd and Stone of Israel (Christ)
will bless Joseph temporally and spiritually—Jacob
chooses to be buried with
his fathers in Canaan—He yields up the
ghost and is gathered to his people.

AND a Jacob called unto his b sons,
and said, Gather yourselves together,
that I may tell you that which shall
befall you in the c last days.

2 Gather yourselves together, and
hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken
unto Israel your a father.

3 ¶ a Reuben, thou art my firstborn,

strong by the hands of the mighty
God of Jacob; (from a thence is the
b shepherd, the c stone of Israel:)

25 Even by the God of thy father,
who shall help thee; and by the a Almighty,
who shall bless thee with
blessings of heaven above, blessings
of the deep that lieth under, blessings
of the breasts, and of the b womb:

26 The a blessings of thy father have
prevailed above the blessings of my
progenitors unto the b utmost bound
of the everlasting c hills: they shall
be on the head of d Joseph, and on
the crown of the head of him that
was separate from his brethren.

27 ¶ a Benjamin shall ravin as a
wolf: in the morning he shall devour
the prey, and at night he shall
divide the spoil.

28 ¶ All these are the a twelve
tribes of Israel: and this is it that
their father spake unto them, and
b blessed them; every one according
to his c blessing he blessed them.

29 And he charged them, and said
unto them, I am to be gathered
unto my a people: b bury me with
my fathers in the cave that is in the
field of Ephron the Hittite,

30 In the cave that is in the field of
a Machpelah, which is before Mamre,
in the land of Canaan, which Abraham
bought with the field of b Ephron
the Hittite for a possession of
a buryingplace.

31 There they a buried Abraham
and Sarah his wife; there they buried
Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and
there I buried Leah.

32 The purchase of the field and
of the cave that is therein was from
the children of Heth.

33 And when Jacob had made an
end of commanding his sons, he
gathered up his feet into the bed,
and yielded up the a ghost, and was
b gathered unto his people.

CHAPTER 50

Jacob’s body is embalmed—Joseph
buries him in Canaan—Joseph comforts
his brothers—The children of
Israel multiply—Joseph promises that
God will bring Israel out of Egypt into
Canaan—Joseph dies in Egypt and is
embalmed.

AND a Joseph fell upon his father’s
face, and b wept upon him, and
kissed him.

2 And Joseph commanded his servants
the physicians to a embalm
his father: and the physicians embalmed
Israel.

3 And forty days were fulfilled for
him; for so are fulfilled the days of
those which are embalmed: and the
Egyptians mourned for him threescore
and ten days.

4 And when the days of his mourning
were past, Joseph spake unto
the house of Pharaoh, saying, If
now I have found grace in your
eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears
of Pharaoh, saying,

5 My father made me swear, saying,
Lo, I die: in my a grave which I
have digged for me in the land of
Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.
Now therefore let me go up, I pray
thee, and bury my father, and I will
come again.

6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and
bury thy father, according as he
made thee swear.

7 ¶ And Joseph went up to bury
his father: and with him went up
all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders
of his house, and all the elders
of the land of Egypt,

8 And all the house of Joseph,
and his brethren, and his father’s
house: only their little ones, and
their flocks, and their herds, they
left in the land of a Goshen.

9 And there went up with him
both chariots and horsemen: and
it was a very great company.

10 And they came to the threshingfloor
of Atad, which is beyond
Jordan, and there they a mourned
with a great and very sore lamentation:
and he made a b mourning
for his father seven days.

11 And when the inhabitants of
the land, the Canaanites, saw the
mourning in the floor of Atad, they
said, This is a grievous mourning to
the Egyptians: wherefore the name
of it was called a Abel-mizraim,
which is beyond Jordan.

12 And his sons did unto him according
as he commanded them:

13 For his sons a carried him into the
land of Canaan, and buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah,
which Abraham bought with the field
for a possession of a b buryingplace of
c Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
14 ¶ And Joseph returned into
Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
that went up with him to bury his
father, after he had buried his father.
15 ¶ And when Joseph’s brethren
saw that their father was dead, they
said, a Joseph will peradventure hate
us, and will certainly requite us all
the evil which we did unto him.

16 And they sent a messenger unto

Joseph, saying, Thy father did command
before he died, saying,

17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, a Forgive,
I pray thee now, the trespass
of thy brethren, and their sin; for
they did unto thee evil: and now,
we pray thee, forgive the trespass
of the servants of the God of thy
father. And Joseph b wept when they
spake unto him.

18 And his brethren also went and
fell down before his face; and they
said, Behold, we be thy a servants.

19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear
not: for am I in the place of God?

20 But as for you, ye thought a evil
against me; but God b meant it unto
c good, to bring to pass, as it is this
day, to save much people alive.

21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will
a nourish you, and your little ones.
And he comforted them, and spake
kindly unto them.

22 ¶ And a Joseph dwelt in Egypt,
he, and his father’s house: and Joseph
lived an hundred and ten years.
23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s
a children of the third generation: the
children also of Machir the son of
b Manasseh were brought up upon
Joseph’s knees.

24 a And Joseph said unto his brethren,
I die: and God will surely visit
you, and b bring you out of this land
unto the c land which he sware to
d Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

25 And Joseph took an a oath of the
children of Israel, saying, God will
surely visit you, and ye shall carry
up my b bones from hence.

26 So a Joseph b died, being an hundred
and ten years old: and they
c embalmed him, and he was put in
a coffin in Egypt.
