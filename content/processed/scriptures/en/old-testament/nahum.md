MICAH 7:7–NAHUM 1:2 1156



father, the daughter riseth up against
her mother, the daughter in law
against her mother in law; a man’s
_**a**_ enemies _are_ the men of his own
_**b**_ house.
7 Therefore I will look unto the
LORD; I will wait for the God of my
salvation: my God will _**[a ]**_ hear me.
8 ¶ Rejoice not against me, O mine
enemy: when I fall, I shall arise;
when I sit in _**[a ]**_ darkness, the LORD
_shall be_ a _**[b ]**_ light unto me.
9 I will _**[a ]**_ bear the indignation of the
LORD, because I have sinned against
him, until he plead my cause, and
execute judgment for me: he will
bring me forth to the _**[b ]**_ light, _and_ I
shall behold his righteousness.
10 Then _she that is_ mine enemy
shall see _it,_ and shame shall cover
her which said unto me, Where is
the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall
behold her: now shall she be _**[a ]**_ trodden down as the mire of the streets.
11 _In_ the day that thy walls are to
be built, _in_ that day shall the decree
be far removed.
12 _In_ that day _also_ he shall _**[a ]**_ come
even to thee from Assyria, and
_from_ the fortified cities, and from
the fortress even to the river, and
from sea to sea, and _from_ mountain
to mountain.
13 Notwithstanding the land shall
be desolate because of them that



dwell therein, for the fruit of their
doings.
14 ¶ Feed thy people with thy rod,
the flock of thine heritage, which
dwell solitarily _in_ the wood, in the
midst of Carmel: let them feed _in_
Bashan and Gilead, as in the days
of old.
15 According to the days of thy
coming out of the land of Egypt will
I shew unto him marvellous _things._
16 ¶ The nations shall see and be
confounded at all their might: they
shall lay _their_ hand upon _their_ mouth,
their ears shall be deaf.
17 They shall lick the dust like a
serpent, they shall move out of their
holes like worms of the earth: they
shall be afraid of the LORD our God,
and shall fear because of thee.
18 Who _is_ a God like unto thee,
that _**[a ]**_ pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth
not his _**[b ]**_ anger for ever, because he
_**c**_ delighteth _in_ _**d**_ mercy.
19 He will turn again, he will have
_**a**_ compassion upon us; he will subdue
our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all
their sins into the depths of the sea.
20 Thou wilt perform the truth to
Jacob, _and_ the mercy to _**[a ]**_ Abraham,
which thou hast _**[b ]**_ sworn unto our
fathers from the days of old.
