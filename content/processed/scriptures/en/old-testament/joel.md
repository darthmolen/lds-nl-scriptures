|CHAPTER 1<br>Call a solemn assembly and gather to<br>the house of the Lord, for the day of the<br>Lord is at hand.<br>T<br>HE word of the LORD that came<br>to Joel the son of Pethuel.<br>2 Hear this, ye a old men, and<br>give ear, all ye b inhabitants of the<br>land. Hath this been in your days,<br>or even in the days of your fathers?<br>3 Tell ye your children of it, and<br>let your children tell their chil-<br>dren, and their children another<br>generation.<br>4 a That which the palmerworm<br>hath left hath the b locust eaten; and<br>that which the locust hath left hath<br>the cankerworm eaten; and that<br>which the cankerworm hath left<br>hath the caterpiller eaten.<br>5 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep;<br>and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,<br>because of the new wine; for it is<br>a cut off from your mouth.<br>6 For a nation is come up upon my<br>land, strong, and without a number,<br>whose b teeth are the teeth of a lion,<br>and he hath the cheek teeth of a<br>great lion.<br>7 He hath laid my vine waste, and<br>barked my fig tree: he hath made<br>it clean bare, and cast it away; the<br>branches thereof are made white.<br>8 ¶ Lament like a virgin girded<br>with sackcloth for the a husband of<br>her youth.<br>9 The meat offering and the drink<br>offering is cut off from the house|Col2|of the LORD; the priests, the LORD’s<br>ministers, mourn.<br>10 The field is wasted, the a land<br>mourneth; for the b corn is wasted:<br>the new wine is dried up, the oil<br>languisheth.<br>11 Be ye ashamed, O ye husband-<br>men; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the<br>wheat and for the barley; because<br>the harvest of the field is perished.<br>12 The vine is dried up, and the<br>fig tree languisheth; the pomegran-<br>ate tree, the palm tree also, and the<br>apple tree, even all the trees of the<br>field, are withered: because a joy is<br>withered away from the sons of men.<br>13 a Gird yourselves, and lament,<br>ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the<br>altar: come, lie all night in sack-<br>cloth, ye ministers of my God: for<br>the meat offering and the drink off-<br>ering is withholden from the house<br>of your God.<br>14 ¶ Sanctify ye a a fast, call a b sol-<br>emn assembly, gather the elders and<br>all the inhabitants of the land into<br>the house of the LORD your God,<br>and cry unto the LORD,<br>15 Alas for the day! for the a day<br>of the LORD is at hand, and as a de-<br>struction from the Almighty shall<br>it come.<br>16 Is not the a meat cut off before<br>our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from<br>the house of our God?<br>17 The seed is rotten under their<br>clods, the a garners are laid desolate,<br>the barns are broken down; for the<br>corn is withered.|Col4|

|18 How do the beasts groan! the<br>herds of cattle are perplexed, be-<br>cause they have no pasture; yea, the<br>flocks of sheep are made desolate.<br>19 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the<br>a fire hath devoured the pastures of<br>the wilderness, and the flame hath<br>burned all the trees of the field.<br>20 The a beasts of the field cry also<br>unto thee: for the rivers of waters are<br>dried up, and the fire hath devoured<br>the pastures of the wilderness.<br>CHAPTER 2<br>War and desolation will precede the<br>Second Coming—The sun and the moon<br>will be darkened—The Lord will pour<br>out His Spirit upon all flesh—There<br>will be dreams and visions.<br>BLOW ye the a trumpet in Zion,<br>and sound an alarm in my holy<br>b mountain: let all the inhabitants<br>of the land tremble: for the c day of<br>the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at<br>hand;<br>2 A day of a darkness and of gloomi-<br>ness, a day of clouds and of thick<br>darkness, as the morning spread<br>upon the mountains: a great people<br>and a strong; there hath not been<br>ever the like, neither shall be any<br>more after it, even to the years of<br>many generations.<br>3 A fire a devoureth before them;<br>and behind them a flame burneth:<br>the land is as the garden of b Eden<br>before them, and behind them a<br>desolate wilderness; yea, and noth-<br>ing shall escape them.<br>4 The appearance of them is as|Col2|the appearance of horses; and as<br>horsemen, so shall they run.<br>5 Like the a noise of chariots on the<br>tops of mountains shall they leap,<br>like the noise of a flame of fire that<br>devoureth the b stubble, as a strong<br>people set in battle array.<br>6 Before their face the people<br>shall be much pained: all faces shall<br>gather a blackness.<br>7 They shall run like mighty men;<br>they shall climb the wall like men<br>of war; and they shall march every<br>one on his ways, and they shall not<br>break their ranks:<br>8 Neither shall one thrust another;<br>they shall walk every one in his<br>path: and when they fall upon the<br>sword, they shall not be wounded.<br>9 They shall run to and fro in the<br>city; they shall run upon the wall,<br>they shall climb up upon the houses;<br>they shall enter in at the windows<br>like a thief.<br>10 The a earth shall quake before<br>them; the heavens shall b tremble:<br>the c sun and the moon shall be<br>d dark, and the stars shall withdraw<br>their shining:<br>11 And the LORD shall utter his<br>a voice before his army: for his camp<br>is very great: for he is strong that<br>executeth his word: for the b day of<br>the LORD is c great and very terrible;<br>and who can d abide it?<br>12 ¶ Therefore also now, saith the<br>LORD, a turn ye even to me with all<br>your b heart, and with c fasting, and<br>with weeping, and with mourning:<br>13 And a rend your heart, and not<br>your garments, b and turn unto the|Col4|
