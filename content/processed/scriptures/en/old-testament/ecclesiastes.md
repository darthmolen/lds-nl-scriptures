845 PROVERBS 31:10–ECCLESIASTES 1:2



10 ¶ Who can find a _**[a ]**_ virtuous
_**b**_ woman? for her price _is_ far above
rubies.
11 The heart of her husband doth
safely _**[a ]**_ trust in her, so that he shall
have no need of spoil.
12 She will do him good and not
evil all the days of her life.
13 She seeketh wool, and flax,
and worketh willingly with her
_**a**_ hands.
14 She is like the merchants’ ships;
she bringeth her food from afar.
15 She _**[a ]**_ riseth also while it is yet
night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands
she planteth a vineyard.
17 She girdeth her loins with
strength, and strengtheneth her
arms.
18 She perceiveth that her merchandise _is_ good: her candle goeth
not out by night.
19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the _**[a ]**_ distaff.
20 She stretcheth out her hand to
the _**[a ]**_ poor; yea, she reacheth forth
her hands to the needy.
21 She is not afraid of the snow for



her household: for all her household
_are_ clothed with scarlet.
22 She maketh herself coverings
of tapestry; her _**[a ]**_ clothing _is_ silk
and purple.
23 Her husband is known in the
gates, when he sitteth among the
elders of the land.
24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth _it;_ and delivereth girdles unto
the merchant.
25 Strength and honour _are_ her
_**a**_ clothing; and she shall rejoice in
time to come.
26 She openeth her mouth with
wisdom; and in her tongue _is_ the
law of _**[a ]**_ kindness.
27 She looketh well to the ways of
her household, and eateth not the
bread of _**[a ]**_ idleness.
28 Her children arise up, and call
her blessed; her husband _also,_ and
he praiseth her.
29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
30 Favour _is_ deceitful, and _**[a ]**_ beauty
_is_ vain: _but_ a woman _that_ _**[b ]**_ feareth
the LORD, she shall be praised.
31 Give her of the fruit of her
hands; and let her own works praise
her in the gates.

|7 I got me servants and maidens,<br>and had servants born in my house;<br>also I had great possessions of great<br>and small cattle above all that were<br>in Jerusalem before me:<br>8 I gathered me also silver and<br>a gold, and the peculiar treasure of<br>kings and of the b provinces: I gat<br>me men singers and women sing-<br>ers, and the delights of the sons of<br>men, as musical instruments, and<br>that of all sorts.<br>9 So I was great, and increased<br>more than all that were before me<br>in Jerusalem: also my wisdom re-<br>mained with me.<br>10 And whatsoever mine eyes de-<br>sired I kept not from them, I with-<br>held not my heart from any joy; for<br>my heart rejoiced in all my labour:<br>and this was my portion of all my<br>a labour.<br>11 Then I looked on all the works<br>that my hands had wrought, and on<br>the labour that I had laboured to<br>do: and, behold, all was vanity and<br>vexation of spirit, and there was no<br>profit under the sun.<br>12 ¶ And I turned myself to behold<br>wisdom, and madness, and folly: for<br>what can the man do that cometh<br>after the king? even that which hath<br>been already done.<br>13 Then I saw that wisdom excel-<br>leth folly, as far as light excelleth<br>a darkness.<br>14 The wise man’s eyes are in his<br>head; but the fool walketh in a dark-<br>ness: and I myself perceived also that<br>one b event happeneth to them all.<br>15 Then said I in my heart, As it<br>happeneth to the fool, so it hap-<br>peneth even to me; and why was<br>I then more a wise? Then I said in<br>my heart, that this also is vanity.<br>16 For there is no a remembrance<br>of the wise more than of the fool<br>for ever; seeing that which now<br>is in the days to come shall all be|Col2|forgotten. And how b dieth the wise<br>man? as the fool.<br>17 Therefore I hated life; because<br>the work that is wrought under the<br>sun is grievous unto me: for all is<br>vanity and a vexation of spirit.<br>18 ¶ Yea, I hated all my labour<br>which I had taken under the sun:<br>because I should leave it unto the<br>man that shall be after me.<br>19 And who knoweth whether he<br>shall be a wise man or a fool? yet<br>shall he have rule over all my la-<br>bour wherein I have laboured, and<br>wherein I have shewed myself wise<br>under the sun. This is also vanity.<br>20 Therefore I went about to cause<br>my heart to a despair of all the la-<br>bour which I took under the sun.<br>21 For there is a man whose labour<br>is in wisdom, and in knowledge,<br>and in a equity; yet to a man that<br>hath not laboured therein shall he<br>leave it for his portion. This also is<br>b vanity and a great evil.<br>22 For what hath man of all his<br>labour, and of the vexation of his<br>heart, wherein he hath laboured<br>under the sun?<br>23 For all his days are sorrows,<br>and his travail grief; yea, his heart<br>taketh not rest in the night. This is<br>also vanity.<br>24 ¶ There is nothing better for a<br>man, than that he should eat and<br>drink, and that he should make<br>his a soul enjoy good in his b labour.<br>This also I saw, that it was from the<br>hand of God.<br>25 For who can eat, or who else<br>can hasten hereunto, more than I?<br>26 For God giveth to a man that<br>is good in his sight wisdom, and<br>knowledge, and joy: but to the<br>sinner he giveth travail, to gather<br>and to heap up, that he may give<br>to him that is a good before God.<br>This also is vanity and vexation of<br>spirit.|Col4|

855 ECCLESIASTES 10:16–12:5












|16 ¶ Woe to thee, O land, when<br>thy king is a a child, and thy princes<br>eat in the morning!<br>17 Blessed art thou, O land, when<br>thy king is the son of nobles, and<br>thy princes eat in due season, for<br>strength, and not for a drunkenness!<br>18 ¶ By much a slothfulness the<br>building decayeth; and through<br>b idleness of the hands the house<br>droppeth through.<br>19 ¶ A feast is made for laughter,<br>and wine maketh merry: but money<br>answereth all things.<br>20 ¶ Curse not the a king, no not<br>in thy thought; and curse not the<br>rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird<br>of the air shall carry the voice, and<br>that which hath wings shall tell<br>the matter.<br>CHAPTER 11<br>Do good and give to them who need—<br>God will bring all men to judgment.<br>CAST thy a bread upon the waters:<br>for thou shalt find it after many<br>days.<br>2 Give a portion to seven, and also<br>to eight; for thou a knowest not what<br>evil shall be upon the earth.<br>3 If the clouds be full of rain, they<br>empty themselves upon the earth: and<br>if the tree fall toward the south, or<br>toward the north, in the place where<br>the tree falleth, there it shall be.<br>4 He that observeth the wind shall<br>not sow; and he that regardeth the<br>clouds shall not a reap.<br>5 As thou knowest not what is the<br>way of the a spirit, nor how the bones<br>do grow in the womb of her that is<br>with child: even so thou knowest not<br>the works of God who b maketh all.<br>6 In the morning sow thy seed,<br>and in the evening withhold not<br>thine hand: for thou knowest not<br>whether shall prosper, either this|Col2|or that, or whether they both shall<br>be alike good.<br>7 ¶ Truly the a light is sweet, and<br>a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to<br>behold the sun:<br>8 But if a man live many years,<br>and rejoice in them all; yet let him<br>remember the days of a darkness;<br>for they shall be many. All that<br>cometh is b vanity.<br>9 ¶ Rejoice, O young man, in thy<br>youth; and let thy heart a cheer<br>thee in the days of thy youth, and<br>b walk in the ways of thine heart,<br>and in the sight of thine eyes: but<br>know thou, that for all these things<br>God will bring thee into c judgment.<br>10 Therefore remove sorrow from<br>thy heart, and put away a evil<br>from thy flesh: for childhood and<br>youth are b vanity.<br>CHAPTER 12<br>At death the spirit will return to God<br>who gave it—The words of the wise are<br>as goads—The whole duty of man is to<br>fear God and keep His commandments.<br>REMEMBER now thy Creator in the<br>days of thy a youth, while the b evil<br>days come not, nor the years draw<br>nigh, when thou shalt say, I have<br>no pleasure in them;<br>2 While the sun, or the light, or the<br>moon, or the stars, be not darkened,<br>nor the clouds return after the rain:<br>3 In the day when the keepers of<br>the house shall tremble, and the<br>strong men shall bow themselves,<br>and the grinders cease because they<br>are few, and those that look out of<br>the windows be darkened,<br>4 And the doors shall be shut in the<br>streets, when the sound of the grind-<br>ing is low, and he shall rise up at the<br>voice of the bird, and all the daugh-<br>ters of musick shall be brought low;<br>5 Also when they shall be afraid of|Col4|
