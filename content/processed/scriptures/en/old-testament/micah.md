JONAH 4:4–MICAH 1:7 1150



4 ¶ Then said the LORD, Doest thou
well to be angry ?
5 So Jonah went out of the city, and
sat on the east side of the city,
and there made him a _**[a ]**_ booth, and
sat under it in the shadow, till he
might see what would become of
the city.
6 And the LORD God prepared a
_**a**_ gourd, and made _it_ to come up over
Jonah, that it might be a shadow
over his head, to deliver him from
his grief. So Jonah was exceeding
glad of the gourd.
7 But God prepared a worm when
the morning rose the next day, and
it smote the gourd that it withered.
8 And it came to pass, when the
sun did arise, that God prepared a
vehement _**[a ]**_ east wind; and the sun



beat upon the head of Jonah, that
he fainted, and wished in himself
to die, and said, _It is_ better for me to
die than to live.
9 And God said to Jonah, Doest
thou well to be _**[a ]**_ angry for the gourd?
And he said, I do well to be angry,
_even_ unto death.
10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast
had pity on the gourd, for the which
thou hast not laboured, neither
madest it grow; which came up in
a night, and perished in a night:
11 And should not I _**[a ]**_ spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
more than sixscore thousand _**[b ]**_ persons that cannot _**[c ]**_ discern between
their right hand and their left hand;
and _also_ much cattle?

|what a Balak king of Moab consulted,<br>and what Balaam the son of Beor<br>answered him from Shittim unto<br>Gilgal; that ye may know the righ-<br>teousness of the LORD.<br>6 ¶ Wherewith shall I come before<br>the LORD, and bow myself before the<br>high God? shall I come before him<br>with burnt offerings, with calves<br>of a year old?<br>7 Will the LORD be pleased with<br>thousands of a rams, or with ten thou-<br>sands of rivers of oil? shall I give<br>my b firstborn for my c transgression,<br>the fruit of my body for the sin<br>of my soul?<br>8 He hath shewed thee, O man,<br>what is good; and what doth the<br>LORD a require of thee, but to do<br>b justly, and to love c mercy, and to<br>d walk e humbly with thy God?<br>9 The LORD’s voice crieth unto the<br>city, and the man of wisdom shall<br>see thy name: hear ye the rod, and<br>who hath appointed it.<br>10 ¶ Are there yet the a treasures<br>of wickedness in the house of the<br>wicked, and the scant measure that<br>is abominable?<br>11 Shall I count them a pure with<br>the wicked b balances, and with the<br>bag of deceitful weights?<br>12 For the rich men thereof are full<br>of a violence, and the inhabitants<br>thereof have spoken lies, and their<br>tongue is deceitful in their mouth.<br>13 Therefore also will I make thee<br>sick in smiting thee, in making thee<br>desolate because of thy sins.<br>14 Thou shalt eat, but not be a sat-<br>isfied; and b thy casting down shall<br>be in the midst of thee; and thou<br>shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver;<br>and that which thou deliverest will<br>I give up to the sword.|Col2|15 Thou shalt a sow, but thou shalt<br>not reap; thou shalt tread the olives,<br>but thou shalt not anoint thee with<br>oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not<br>drink wine.<br>16 ¶ For the statutes of a Omri are<br>kept, and all the works of the house<br>of Ahab, and ye walk in their coun-<br>sels; that I should make thee a b deso-<br>lation, and the inhabitants thereof<br>an hissing: therefore ye shall bear<br>the c reproach of my people.<br>CHAPTER 7<br>Though the people of Israel have rebelled,<br>yet in the last days the Lord will have<br>mercy on them—He will have compas-<br>sion and pardon their iniquities.<br>WOE is me! for I am as when they<br>have gathered the summer fruits, as<br>the grapegleanings of the vintage:<br>there is no cluster to eat: my soul<br>desired the firstripe fruit.<br>2 The good man is perished out of<br>the earth: and there is none upright<br>among men: they all lie in wait for<br>blood; they hunt every man his<br>a brother with a net.<br>3 ¶ That they may do evil with<br>both hands earnestly, the prince<br>asketh, and the judge asketh for a<br>reward; and the great man, he ut-<br>tereth his mischievous desire: so<br>they wrap it up.<br>4 The best of them is as a brier:<br>the most upright is sharper than a<br>thorn hedge: the day of thy watch-<br>men and thy a visitation cometh; now<br>shall be their perplexity.<br>5 ¶ a Trust ye not in a friend, put<br>ye not confidence in a guide: keep<br>the doors of thy mouth from her<br>that lieth in thy bosom.<br>6 For the son dishonoureth the|Col4|
