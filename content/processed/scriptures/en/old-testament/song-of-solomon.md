ECCLESIASTES 12:6–SONG OF SOLOMON 1:6 856



_that which is_ high, and fears _shall_
_be_ in the way, and the almond tree
shall flourish, and the grasshopper
shall be a burden, and desire shall
fail: because man goeth to his long
_**a**_ home, and the mourners go about
the streets:
6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed,
or the golden bowl be broken, or the
pitcher be broken at the fountain,
or the wheel broken at the cistern.
7 Then shall the _**[a ]**_ dust return to
the earth as it was: and the _**[b ]**_ spirit
shall return unto God who _**[c ]**_ gave it.
8 ¶ Vanity of vanities, saith the
preacher; all _is_ vanity.
9 And moreover, because the
preacher was wise, he still taught
the people knowledge; yea, he gave
good heed, and sought out, _and_ set
in order many proverbs.



10 The preacher sought to find out
_**a**_ acceptable words: and _that which_
_was_ written _was_ upright, _even_ words
of truth.
11 The words of the wise _are_ as
_**a**_ goads, and as nails fastened _by_ the
masters of assemblies, _which_ are
given from one shepherd.
12 And further, by these, my son,
be admonished: of making many
books _there is_ no end; and much
_**a**_ study _is_ a weariness of the flesh.
13 ¶ Let us hear the conclusion of
the whole matter: _**[a ]**_ Fear God, and
_**b**_ keep his commandments: for this
_is_ the whole _**[c ]**_ _duty_ of man.
14 For God shall bring every
_**a**_ work into _**b**_ judgment, with every
secret thing, whether _it be_ good, or
whether _it be_ evil.

|CHAPTER 3<br>A love song concerning Solomon is<br>presented.<br>BY night on my bed I sought him<br>whom my soul loveth: I sought him,<br>but I found him not.<br>2 I will rise now, and go about<br>the city in the streets, and in the<br>broad ways I will seek him whom<br>my soul loveth: I sought him, but I<br>found him not.<br>3 The watchmen that go about the<br>city found me: to whom I said, Saw<br>ye him whom my soul loveth?<br>4 It was but a little that I passed<br>from them, but I found him whom<br>my soul loveth: I held him, and<br>would not let him go, until I had<br>brought him into my mother’s<br>house, and into the chamber of her<br>that conceived me.<br>5 I charge you, O ye daughters<br>of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by<br>the hinds of the field, that ye stir<br>not up, nor awake my love, till he<br>please.<br>6 ¶ Who is this that cometh out<br>of the wilderness like pillars of<br>smoke, perfumed with myrrh and<br>frankincense, with all powders of<br>the merchant?<br>7 Behold his bed, which is Solo-<br>mon’s; threescore valiant men are<br>about it, of the valiant of Israel.<br>8 They all hold swords, being expert<br>in war: every man hath his sword<br>upon his thigh because of fear in<br>the night.<br>9 King Solomon made himself a<br>chariot of the wood of Lebanon.<br>10 He made the pillars thereof of<br>silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the<br>covering of it of purple, the midst<br>thereof being paved with love, for<br>the daughters of Jerusalem.<br>11 Go forth, O ye daughters of<br>Zion, and behold king Solomon with<br>the crown wherewith his mother<br>crowned him in the day of his es-<br>pousals, and in the day of the glad-<br>ness of his heart.|Col2|CHAPTER 4<br>A song describes the beauty of the po-<br>et’s beloved.<br>BEHOLD, thou art fair, my love; be-<br>hold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’<br>eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as<br>a flock of goats, that appear from<br>mount Gilead.<br>2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep<br>that are even shorn, which came up<br>from the washing; whereof every<br>one bear twins, and none is barren<br>among them.<br>3 Thy lips are like a thread of scar-<br>let, and thy speech is comely: thy<br>temples are like a piece of a pome-<br>granate within thy locks.<br>4 Thy neck is like the tower of<br>David builded for an armoury,<br>whereon there hang a thousand<br>bucklers, all shields of mighty men.<br>5 Thy two breasts are like two<br>young roes that are twins, which<br>feed among the lilies.<br>6 Until the day break, and the<br>shadows flee away, I will get me to<br>the mountain of myrrh, and to the<br>hill of frankincense.<br>7 Thou art all fair, my love; there<br>is no spot in thee.<br>8 ¶ Come with me from Lebanon,<br>my a spouse, with me from Lebanon:<br>look from the top of Amana, from the<br>top of Shenir and Hermon, from<br>the lions’ dens, from the mountains<br>of the leopards.<br>9 Thou hast ravished my heart,<br>a my b sister, my spouse; thou hast<br>ravished my heart with one of<br>thine eyes, with one chain of thy<br>neck.<br>10 How fair is thy love, my sis-<br>ter, my spouse! how much better is<br>thy love than wine! and the smell<br>of thine ointments than all spices!<br>11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as<br>the honeycomb: honey and milk<br>are under thy tongue; and the smell<br>of thy garments is like the smell of<br>Lebanon.<br>12 A garden inclosed is my sister,|Col4|

SONG OF SOLOMON 6:6–8:5 860



for they have overcome me: thy hair
_is_ as a flock of goats that appear
from Gilead.
6 Thy teeth _are_ as a flock of sheep
which go up from the washing,
whereof every one beareth twins,
and _there is_ not one barren among
them.
7 As a piece of a pomegranate _are_
thy temples within thy locks.
8 There are threescore queens, and
fourscore concubines, and virgins
without number.
9 My dove, my undefiled is _but_ one;
she _is_ the _only_ one of her mother,
she _is_ the choice _one_ of her that bare
her. The daughters saw her, and
blessed her; _yea,_ the queens and the
concubines, and they praised her.
10 ¶ Who _is_ she _that_ looketh forth
as the morning, fair as the moon,
clear as the sun, _and_ terrible as _an_
_army_ with banners?
11 I went down into the garden of
nuts to see the fruits of the valley,
_and_ to see whether the vine flourished, _and_ the pomegranates budded.
12 Or ever I was aware, my soul
made me _like_ the chariots of Amminadib.
13 Return, return, O Shulamite;
return, return, that we may look
upon thee. What will ye see in the
Shulamite? As it were the company
of two armies.


CHAPTER 7


_The song of love continues._


HOW beautiful are thy feet with
shoes, O prince’s daughter! the
joints of thy thighs _are_ like jewels,
the work of the hands of a cunning
workman.
2 Thy navel _is like_ a round goblet,
_which_ wanteth not liquor: thy belly
_is like_ an heap of wheat set about
with lilies.
3 Thy two breasts _are_ like two
young roes _that are_ twins.
4 Thy neck _is_ as a tower of ivory;
thine eyes _like_ the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim:
thy nose _is_ as the tower of Lebanon
which looketh toward Damascus.



5 Thine head upon thee _is_ like
Carmel, and the hair of thine head
like purple; the king _is_ held in the
galleries.
6 How fair and how pleasant art
thou, O love, for delights!
7 This thy stature is like to a palm
tree, and thy breasts to clusters _of_
_grapes._
8 I said, I will go up to the palm
tree, I will take hold of the boughs
thereof: now also thy breasts shall
be as clusters of the vine, and the
smell of thy nose like apples;
9 And the roof of thy mouth like
the best wine for my beloved, that
goeth _down_ sweetly, causing the lips
of those that are asleep to speak.
10 ¶ I _am_ my beloved’s, and his
desire _is_ toward me.
11 Come, my beloved, let us go
forth into the field; let us lodge in
the villages.
12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish,
_whether_ the tender grape appear, _and_
the pomegranates bud forth: there
will I give thee my loves.
13 The mandrakes give a smell,
and at our gates _are_ all manner of
pleasant _fruits,_ new and old, _which_ I
have laid up for thee, O my beloved.


CHAPTER 8


_Many waters cannot quench love._


O THAT thou _wert_ as my brother, that
sucked the breasts of my mother!
_when_ I should find thee without, I
would kiss thee; yea, I should not
be despised.
2 I would lead thee, _and_ bring thee
into my mother’s house, _who_ would
instruct me: I would cause thee to
drink of spiced wine of the juice
of my pomegranate.
3 His left hand _should be_ under my
head, and his right hand should
embrace me.
4 I charge you, O daughters of
Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor
awake _my_ love, until he please.
5 Who _is_ this that cometh up from
the wilderness, leaning upon her
beloved? I raised thee up under the
