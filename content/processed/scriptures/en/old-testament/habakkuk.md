1159 NAHUM 3:14–HABAKKUK 1:10



thine enemies: the fire shall devour
thy bars.
14 Draw thee waters for the siege,
fortify thy strong holds: go into clay,
and tread the mortar, make strong
the brickkiln.
15 There shall the fire devour thee;
the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat
thee up like the cankerworm: make
thyself many as the cankerworm,
make thyself many as the locusts.
16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.
17 Thy crowned _are_ as the locusts,



and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges
in the cold day, _but_ when the sun
ariseth they flee away, and their
place is not known where they _are._
18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king
of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell
_in the dust:_ thy people is scattered
upon the mountains, and no man
gathereth _them._
19 _There is_ no healing of thy bruise;
thy wound is grievous: all that hear
the _**[a ]**_ bruit of thee shall clap the
hands over thee: for upon whom
hath not thy wickedness passed
continually ?

O LORD, thou hast<br>ordained them for judgment; and, O<br>mighty God, thou hast established<br>them for correction.<br>13 Thou art of purer eyes than to<br>behold evil, and canst not look on<br>iniquity: wherefore lookest thou<br>upon them that deal treacherously,<br>and holdest thy tongue when the<br>wicked devoureth the man that is<br>more righteous than he?<br>14 And makest men as the fishes<br>of the sea, as the creeping things,<br>that have no ruler over them?<br>15 They take up all of them with<br>the a angle, they catch them in<br>their net, and gather them in their<br>b drag: therefore they rejoice and are<br>glad.<br>16 Therefore they sacrifice unto<br>their net, and burn incense unto<br>their drag; because by them their<br>portion is fat, and their meat plen-<br>teous.<br>17 Shall they therefore empty their<br>net, and not spare continually to<br>slay the nations?<br>CHAPTER 2<br>The Lord admonishes patience and<br>promises that the just will live by faith—<br>The earth will be filled with knowledge<br>about God—Idols have no power.<br>I WILL stand upon my watch, and<br>set me upon the tower, and will<br>watch to see what he will say unto<br>me, and what I shall answer when<br>I am reproved.<br>2 And the LORD answered me, and<br>said, a Write the vision, and make it|Col2|plain upon tables, that he may run<br>that readeth it.<br>3 For the vision is yet for an ap-<br>pointed time, but at the end it shall<br>speak, and not lie: though it tarry,<br>wait for it; because it will surely<br>a come, it will not tarry.<br>4 Behold, his soul which is lifted<br>up is not upright in him: but the<br>just shall live by his a faith.<br>5 ¶ Yea also, because he transgres-<br>seth by wine, he is a proud man,<br>neither keepeth at home, who en-<br>largeth his desire as hell, and is as<br>death, and cannot be satisfied, but<br>gathereth unto him all nations, and<br>heapeth unto him all people:<br>6 Shall not all these take up a<br>parable against him, and a taunting<br>proverb against him, and say, Woe<br>to him that increaseth that which is<br>not his! how long? and to him that<br>ladeth himself with thick clay!<br>7 Shall they not rise up suddenly<br>that shall bite thee, and awake that<br>shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for<br>a booties unto them?<br>8 Because thou hast a spoiled many<br>nations, all the remnant of the<br>people shall spoil thee; because of<br>men’s blood, and for the violence<br>of the land, of the city, and of all<br>that dwell therein.<br>9 ¶ Woe to him that a coveteth an<br>evil covetousness to his house, that<br>he may set his nest on high, that he<br>may be delivered from the power<br>of evil!<br>10 Thou hast a consulted shame to<br>thy house by cutting off many peo-<br>ple, and hast sinned against thy soul.<br>11 For the stone shall cry out of<br>the wall, and a the beam out of the<br>timber shall answer it.<br>12 ¶ Woe to him that buildeth a<br>town with a blood, and stablisheth<br>a city by iniquity!<br>13 Behold, is it not of the LORD of<br>hosts that the people shall labour in|Col4|
