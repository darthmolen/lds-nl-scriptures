811 PSALM 149:5–PROVERBS 1:11



5 Let the saints be joyful in _**[a ]**_ glory:
let them _**[b ]**_ sing aloud upon their _**[c ]**_ beds.
6 _Let_ the high _praises_ of God _be_ in
their mouth, and a _**[a ]**_ twoedged sword
in their hand;
7 To execute vengeance upon the
heathen, _and_ punishments upon
the people;
8 To bind their kings with chains,
and their nobles with fetters of iron;
9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all
his saints. Praise ye the LORD.


PSALM 150


_Praise God in His sanctuary—Let ev-_
_erything that has breath praise the Lord._



PRAISE ye the LORD. Praise God in
his _**[a ]**_ sanctuary: praise him in the
firmament of his power.
2 Praise him for his mighty acts:
praise him according to his excellent greatness.
3 Praise him with the sound of
the trumpet: praise him with the
psaltery and harp.
4 Praise him with the timbrel and
dance: praise him with stringed instruments and _**[a ]**_ organs.
5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
sounding cymbals.
6 Let every thing that hath breath
praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
