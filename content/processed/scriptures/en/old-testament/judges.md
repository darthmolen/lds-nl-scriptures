343 JOSHUA 24:28–JUDGES 1:7



people, Behold, this stone shall be
a witness unto us; for it hath heard
all the words of the LORD which he
spake unto us: it shall be therefore
a witness unto you, lest ye deny
your God.
28 So Joshua let the people depart,
every man unto his inheritance.
29 ¶ And it came to pass after these
things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
the servant of the LORD, died, _being_
an hundred and ten years old.
30 And they _**[a ]**_ buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which _is_ in mount Ephraim,
on the north side of the hill of
Gaash.
31 And Israel _**[a ]**_ served the LORD
all the days of Joshua, and all the



days of the elders that overlived
Joshua, and which had known all
the works of the LORD, that he had
done for Israel.
32 ¶ And the _**[a ]**_ bones of Joseph,
which the children of Israel brought
up out of Egypt, buried they in
Shechem, in a parcel of ground
which Jacob bought of the sons of
Hamor the father of Shechem for
an hundred pieces of silver: and it
became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron
died; and they buried him in a hill
_that pertained to_ Phinehas his son,
which was given him in _**[a ]**_ mount
Ephraim.

So Barak went<br>down from mount Tabor, and ten<br>thousand men after him.<br>15 And the LORD a discomfited<br>b Sisera, and all his chariots, and all<br>his host, with the edge of the sword<br>before Barak; so that Sisera lighted<br>down off his chariot, and fled away<br>on his feet.<br>16 But Barak pursued after the<br>chariots, and after the host, unto<br>Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all<br>the host of Sisera fell upon the edge<br>of the sword; and there was not a<br>man left.<br>17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his<br>feet to the tent of Jael the wife of<br>Heber the Kenite: for there was peace<br>between Jabin the king of Hazor<br>and the house of Heber the Kenite.<br>18 ¶ And Jael went out to meet<br>Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,<br>my lord, turn in to me; fear not.<br>And when he had turned in unto<br>her into the tent, she covered him<br>with a a mantle.<br>19 And he said unto her, Give me,<br>I pray thee, a little water to drink;<br>for I am thirsty.

But<br>the youth drew not his sword: for he<br>feared, because he was yet a youth.<br>21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said,<br>Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the<br>man is, so is his strength. And Gideon<br>arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna,<br>and took away the ornaments that<br>were on their camels’ necks.<br>22 ¶ Then the men of Israel said<br>unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,<br>both thou, and thy son, and thy<br>son’s son also: for thou hast deliv-<br>ered us from the hand of Midian.<br>23 And Gideon said unto them, I<br>will not a rule over you, neither shall<br>my son rule over you: the LORD shall<br>b rule over you.<br>24 ¶ And Gideon said unto them,<br>I would desire a request of you,<br>that ye would give me every man<br>the earrings of his prey.

And, be-<br>hold, there came none to the camp<br>from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.<br>9 For the people were numbered,<br>and, behold, there were none of<br>the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead<br>there.<br>10 And the congregation sent<br>thither twelve thousand men of the<br>valiantest, and commanded them,<br>saying, Go and smite the inhabi-<br>tants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge<br>of the sword, with the women and<br>the children.<br>11 And this is the thing that ye<br>shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy<br>every male, and every woman that<br>hath lain by man.<br>12 And they found among the<br>inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four<br>hundred young virgins, that had<br>known no man by lying with any<br>male: and they brought them unto<br>the camp to Shiloh, which is in the<br>land of Canaan.<br>13 And the whole congregation<br>sent some to speak to the children<br>of Benjamin that were in the rock<br>Rimmon, and to call peaceably<br>unto them.<br>14 And Benjamin came again at<br>that time; and they gave them wives<br>which they had saved alive of the<br>women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so<br>they sufficed them not.<br>15 And the people repented them<br>for Benjamin, because that the LORD<br>had made a breach in the tribes<br>of Israel.<br>16 ¶ Then the elders of the con-<br>gregation said, How shall we do for<br>wives for them that remain, seeing|Col2|the women are destroyed out of<br>Benjamin?<br>17 And they said, There must be<br>an inheritance for them that be es-<br>caped of Benjamin, that a tribe be<br>not destroyed out of Israel.<br>18 Howbeit we may not give them<br>wives of our daughters: for the chil-<br>dren of Israel have sworn, saying,<br>Cursed be he that giveth a wife to<br>Benjamin.<br>19 Then they said, Behold, there is<br>a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly<br>in a place which is on the north side<br>of Beth-el, on the east side of the<br>highway that goeth up from Beth-el<br>to Shechem, and on the south of<br>Lebonah.<br>20 Therefore they commanded the<br>children of Benjamin, saying, Go<br>and a lie in wait in the vineyards;<br>21 And see, and, behold, if the<br>daughters of Shiloh come out to<br>a dance in dances, then come ye<br>out of the vineyards, and catch you<br>every man his wife of the daugh-<br>ters of Shiloh, and go to the land<br>of Benjamin.<br>22 And it shall be, when their<br>fathers or their brethren come unto<br>us to complain, that we will say unto<br>them, Be favourable unto them for<br>our sakes: because we reserved not<br>to each man his wife in the war: for<br>ye did not give unto them at this<br>time, that ye should be a guilty.<br>23 And the children of Benjamin<br>did so, and took them wives, accord-<br>ing to their number, of them that<br>danced, whom they caught: and<br>they went and returned unto their<br>inheritance, and repaired the cities,<br>and dwelt in them.<br>24 And the children of Israel de-<br>parted thence at that time, every<br>man to his tribe and to his family,<br>and they went out from thence ev-<br>ery man to his inheritance.<br>25 In those days there was no a king<br>in Israel: every man did that which<br>was b right in his own eyes.|Col4|
