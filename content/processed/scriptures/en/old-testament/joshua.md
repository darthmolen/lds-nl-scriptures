DEUTERONOMY 34:1–JOSHUA 1:2 308



AND Moses went up from the plains
of Moab unto the mountain of
Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that _is_
_**a**_ over against Jericho. And the LORD
shewed him all the land of Gilead,
unto Dan,
2 And all Naphtali, and the land of
Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the
land of Judah, unto _**[a ]**_ the utmost sea,
3 And the _**[a ]**_ south, and the plain
of the valley of _**[b ]**_ Jericho, the city
of palm trees, unto Zoar.
4 And the LORD said unto him,
This _is_ the land which I _**[a ]**_ sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy
seed: I have caused thee to see _it_
with thine eyes, but thou shalt not
go over thither.
5 ¶ So _**[a ]**_ Moses the servant of the
LORD _**[b ]**_ died there in the land of
Moab, according to the word of
the LORD.
6 And he _**[a ]**_ buried him in a valley
in the land of Moab, over against
Beth-peor: but no man knoweth _**[b ]**_ of
his _**[c ]**_ sepulchre unto this day.



7 ¶ And Moses _was_ an _**[a ]**_ hundred
and twenty years old when he died:
his eye was not dim, nor his natural
force abated.
8 ¶ And the children of Israel
wept for Moses in the plains of
Moab thirty days: so the days of
weeping _and_ _**[a ]**_ mourning for Moses
were ended.
9 ¶ And Joshua the son of _**[a ]**_ Nun
was full of the spirit of wisdom;
for Moses had _**[b ]**_ laid his hands upon
him: and the children of Israel
_**c**_ hearkened unto him, and did as
the LORD commanded Moses.
10 ¶ And there arose not a _**[a ]**_ prophet
since in Israel like unto Moses,
whom the LORD knew _**[b ]**_ face to face,
11 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to
do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh,
and to all his servants, and to all
his land,
12 And in all that mighty _**[a ]**_ hand,
and in all the great _**[b ]**_ terror which
Moses shewed in the sight of all
Israel.

|Jordan, as the LORD spake unto<br>Joshua, according to the number of<br>the tribes of the children of Israel,<br>and carried them over with them<br>unto the place where they lodged,<br>and laid them down there.<br>9 And Joshua set up twelve stones<br>in the midst of Jordan, in the place<br>where the feet of the priests which<br>bare the ark of the covenant stood:<br>and they are there unto this day.<br>10 ¶ For the priests which bare the<br>ark stood in the midst of Jordan, un-<br>til every thing was finished that the<br>LORD commanded Joshua to speak<br>unto the people, according to all<br>that Moses commanded Joshua: and<br>the people hasted and passed over.<br>11 And it came to pass, when all<br>the people were clean a passed over,<br>that the ark of the LORD passed over,<br>and the priests, in the presence of<br>the people.<br>12 And the children of Reuben,<br>and the children of Gad, and half<br>the tribe of Manasseh, passed over<br>armed before the children of Israel,<br>as Moses spake unto them:<br>13 About forty thousand prepared<br>for war passed over before the LORD<br>unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.<br>14 ¶ On that day the LORD a mag-<br>nified Joshua in the sight of all Is-<br>rael; and they feared him, as they<br>feared Moses, all the days of his life.<br>15 And the LORD spake unto<br>Joshua, saying,<br>16 Command the priests that bear<br>the ark of the a testimony, that they<br>come up out of Jordan.<br>17 Joshua therefore commanded<br>the priests, saying, Come ye up out<br>of Jordan.<br>18 And it came to pass, when the<br>priests that bare the ark of the cov-<br>enant of the LORD were come up<br>out of the midst of Jordan, and the<br>soles of the priests’ feet were lifted<br>up unto the dry land, that the wa-<br>ters of Jordan returned unto their|Col2|place, and flowed over all his banks,<br>as they did before.<br>19 ¶ And the people came up out<br>of Jordan on the tenth day of the<br>first month, and encamped in a Gil-<br>gal, in the east border of Jericho.<br>20 And those twelve stones, which<br>they took out of Jordan, did Joshua<br>pitch in Gilgal.<br>21 And he spake unto the children<br>of Israel, saying, When your children<br>shall ask their fathers in time to come,<br>saying, What mean these stones?<br>22 Then ye shall let your a children<br>b know, saying, Israel came over this<br>Jordan on dry land.<br>23 For the LORD your God dried<br>up the waters of Jordan from before<br>you, until ye were passed over, as<br>the LORD your God did to the Red<br>sea, which he a dried up from before<br>us, until we were gone over:<br>24 That all the people of the earth<br>might a know the hand of the LORD,<br>that it is mighty: that ye might b fear<br>the LORD your God for ever.<br>CHAPTER 5<br>The inhabitants of Canaan fear Israel—<br>The males of Israel are circumcised—<br>Israel keeps the Passover, eats the fruit<br>of the land, and manna ceases—The<br>captain of the Lord’s host appears to<br>Joshua.<br>AND it came to pass, when all the<br>kings of the Amorites, which were<br>on the side of Jordan westward,<br>and all the kings of the Canaanites,<br>which were by the sea, a heard that<br>the LORD had dried up the waters<br>of Jordan from before the children<br>of Israel, until we were passed over,<br>that their b heart melted, neither<br>was there spirit in them any more,<br>because of the children of Israel.<br>2 ¶ At that time the LORD said unto<br>Joshua, Make thee a sharp knives,<br>and b circumcise again the children<br>of Israel the second time.|Col4|

|3 And Joshua made him sharp<br>knives, and circumcised the chil-<br>dren of Israel at the hill of the<br>foreskins.<br>4 And this is the cause why Joshua<br>did circumcise: All the people that<br>came out of Egypt, that were males,<br>even all the men of war, died in the<br>wilderness by the way, after they<br>came out of Egypt.<br>5 Now all the people that came out<br>were circumcised: but all the people<br>that were born in the wilderness by<br>the way as they came forth out of<br>Egypt, them they had not circumcised.<br>6 For the children of Israel walked<br>forty years in the wilderness, till<br>all the people that were men of war,<br>which came out of Egypt, were con-<br>sumed, because they a obeyed not the<br>voice of the LORD: unto whom the<br>LORD sware that he would not shew<br>them the b land, which the LORD<br>c sware unto their fathers that he<br>would give us, a land that floweth<br>with milk and honey.<br>7 And their children, whom he<br>raised up a in their stead, them<br>Joshua circumcised: for they were<br>uncircumcised, because they had<br>not circumcised them by the way.<br>8 And it came to pass, when they<br>had done circumcising all the peo-<br>ple, that they abode in their places<br>in the camp, till they were a whole.<br>9 And the LORD said unto Joshua,<br>This day have I rolled away the<br>reproach of Egypt from off you.<br>Wherefore the name of the place is<br>called a Gilgal unto this day.<br>10 ¶ And the children of Israel<br>encamped in Gilgal, and kept the<br>a passover on the fourteenth day of<br>the month at even in the plains of<br>Jericho.<br>11 And they did eat of the a old corn<br>of the land on the morrow after the|Col2|passover, b unleavened cakes, and<br>parched corn in the selfsame day.<br>12 ¶ And the a manna ceased on<br>the morrow after they had eaten<br>of the old corn of the land; neither<br>had the children of Israel manna<br>any more; but they did eat of the<br>fruit of the land of Canaan that year.<br>13 ¶ And it came to pass, when<br>Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted<br>up his eyes and looked, and, behold,<br>there stood a a man over against<br>him with his sword drawn in his<br>hand: and Joshua went unto him,<br>and said unto him, Art thou for us,<br>or for our adversaries?<br>14 And he said, Nay; but as cap-<br>tain of the a host of the LORD am I<br>now come.

|CHAPTER 8<br>Joshua uses an ambush, takes Ai, and<br>slays its inhabitants—He builds an al-<br>tar in Mount Ebal—The words of the<br>law, both blessings and cursings, are<br>read to the people.<br>AND the LORD said unto Joshua,<br>Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:<br>take all the people of war with thee,<br>and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have<br>given into thy hand the king of Ai,<br>and his people, and his city, and<br>his land:<br>2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her<br>king as thou didst unto aJ ericho and<br>her king: only the spoil thereof, and<br>the cattle thereof, shall ye take for<br>a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an<br>ambush for the city behind it.<br>3 ¶ So Joshua arose, and all the<br>people of war, to go up against Ai:<br>and Joshua chose out thirty thou-<br>sand mighty men of valour, and<br>sent them away by night.<br>4 And he commanded them, say-<br>ing, Behold, ye shall lie in wait<br>against the city, even behind the<br>city: go not very far from the city,<br>but be ye all ready:<br>5 And I, and all the people that<br>are with me, will approach unto the<br>city: and it shall come to pass, when<br>they come out against us, as at the<br>first, that we will flee before them,<br>6 (For they will come out after us)<br>till we have drawn them from the<br>city; for they will say, They flee<br>before us, as at the first: therefore<br>we will flee before them.<br>7 Then ye shall rise up from the<br>ambush, and seize upon the city:<br>for the LORD your God will deliver<br>it into your hand.<br>8 And it shall be, when ye have<br>taken the city, that ye shall set the<br>city on fire: according to the com-<br>mandment of the LORD shall ye do.<br>See, I have commanded you.<br>9 ¶ Joshua therefore sent them<br>forth: and they went to lie in ambush,|Col2|and abode between Beth-el and Ai,<br>on the west side of Ai: but Joshua<br>lodged that night among the people.<br>10 And Joshua rose up early in the<br>morning, and numbered the peo-<br>ple, and went up, he and the elders<br>of Israel, before the people to Ai.<br>11 And all the people, even the peo-<br>ple of war that were with him, went<br>up, and drew nigh, and came before<br>the city, and a pitched on the north<br>side of Ai: now there was a valley<br>between them and Ai.<br>12 And he took about five thou-<br>sand men, and set them to lie in<br>ambush between Beth-el and Ai,<br>on the west side of the city.<br>13 And when they had set the peo-<br>ple, even all the host that was on the<br>north of the city, and a their liers in<br>wait on the west of the city, Joshua<br>went that night into the midst of<br>the valley.<br>14 ¶ And it came to pass, when the<br>king of Ai saw it, that they hasted<br>and rose up early, and the men of<br>the city went out against Israel to<br>battle, he and all his people, at a<br>time appointed, before the plain;<br>but he a wist not that there were liers<br>in ambush against him behind the<br>city.<br>15 And Joshua and all Israel made<br>as if they were beaten before them,<br>and fled by the way of the wilder-<br>ness.<br>16 And all the people that were in<br>Ai were called together to pursue<br>after them: and they pursued af-<br>ter Joshua, and were drawn away<br>from the city.<br>17 And there was not a man left<br>in Ai or a Beth-el, that went not out<br>after Israel: and they left the city<br>open, and pursued after Israel.<br>18 And the LORD said unto Joshua,<br>Stretch out the spear that is in thy<br>hand toward Ai; for I will give it into<br>thine hand.

|19 And the ambush arose quickly<br>out of their place, and they ran as<br>soon as he had stretched out his<br>hand: and they entered into the<br>city, and took it, and hasted and<br>set the city on fire.<br>20 And when the men of Ai looked<br>behind them, they saw, and, behold,<br>the smoke of the city ascended up<br>to heaven, and they had no power<br>to flee this way or that way: and the<br>people that fled to the wilderness<br>turned back upon the pursuers.<br>21 And when Joshua and all Israel<br>saw that the ambush had taken the<br>city, and that the smoke of the city<br>ascended, then they turned again,<br>and slew the men of Ai.<br>22 And the other issued out of the<br>city against them; so they were in<br>the midst of Israel, some on this<br>side, and some on that side: and<br>they smote them, so that they let<br>none of them remain or escape.<br>23 And the king of Ai they took<br>alive, and brought him to Joshua.<br>24 And it came to pass, when Is-<br>rael had made an end of slaying all<br>the inhabitants of Ai in the field,<br>in the wilderness wherein they<br>chased them, and when they were<br>all fallen on the edge of the sword,<br>until they were consumed, that all<br>the Israelites returned unto Ai, and<br>smote it with the edge of the sword.<br>25 And so it was, that all that fell<br>that day, both of men and women,<br>were twelve thousand, even all the<br>men of Ai.<br>26 For Joshua drew not his hand<br>back, wherewith he stretched out<br>the spear, until he had utterly de-<br>stroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.<br>27 Only the cattle and the spoil<br>of that city Israel took for a a prey<br>unto themselves, according unto<br>the word of the LORD which he<br>commanded Joshua.<br>28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made|Col2|it an heap for ever, even a desolation<br>unto this day.<br>29 And the king of Ai he hanged<br>on a tree until eventide: and as<br>soon as the sun was down, Joshua<br>commanded that they should take<br>his carcase down from the tree, and<br>cast it at the entering of the gate of<br>the city, and raise thereon a great<br>heap of stones, that remaineth unto<br>this day.<br>30 ¶ Then Joshua built an altar<br>unto the LORD God of Israel in<br>mount Ebal,<br>31 As Moses the servant of the<br>LORD commanded the children of<br>Israel, as it is written in the book of<br>the law of Moses, an a altar of whole<br>b stones, over which no man hath<br>lift up any c iron: and they offered<br>thereon burnt offerings unto the<br>LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.<br>32 ¶ And he a wrote there upon the<br>stones a copy of the law of Moses,<br>which he wrote in the presence of<br>the children of Israel.<br>33 And all Israel, and their elders,<br>and officers, and their judges, stood<br>on this side the ark and on that<br>side before the priests the Levites,<br>which bare the ark of the covenant<br>of the LORD, as well the stranger, as<br>he that was born among them; half<br>of them over against mount a Geri-<br>zim, and half of them over against<br>mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of<br>the LORD had commanded before,<br>that they should bless the people<br>of Israel.<br>34 And afterward he a read all the<br>words of the law, the blessings and<br>b cursings, according to all that is<br>written in the book of the law.<br>35 There was not a word of all that<br>Moses commanded, which Joshua<br>read not before all the a congrega-<br>tion of Israel, with the women, and<br>the little ones, and the strangers<br>that b were conversant among them.|Col4|
