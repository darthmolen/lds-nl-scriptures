father: and Jehoram his son reigned
in his stead.
51 ¶ Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
two years over Israel.
52 And he did evil in the sight of the



LORD, and walked in the way of his
father, and in the way of his mother,
and in the way of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
53 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
the LORD God of Israel, according
to all that his father had done.

|CHAPTER 1<br>Ahaziah turns to Baalzebub to learn if<br>he will live—Elijah prophesies Ahazi-<br>ah’s death—Elijah calls down fire from<br>heaven to consume the soldiers sent to<br>apprehend him.<br>T<br>HEN a Moab rebelled against<br>Israel after the death of Ahab.<br>2 And Ahaziah fell down<br>through a lattice in his upper cham-<br>ber that was in Samaria, and was<br>sick: and he sent messengers, and<br>said unto them, Go, inquire of a Baal-<br>zebub the god of Ekron whether I<br>shall recover of this disease.<br>3 But the angel of the LORD said<br>to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up<br>to meet the messengers of the king<br>of Samaria, and say unto them, Is<br>it not because there is not a God in<br>Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-<br>zebub the god of Ekron?<br>4 Now therefore thus saith the<br>LORD, Thou shalt not come down<br>from that bed on which thou art<br>gone up, but shalt surely a die. And<br>Elijah departed.|Col2|5 ¶ And when the messengers<br>turned back unto him, he said unto<br>them, Why are ye now turned back?<br>6 And they said unto him, There<br>came a man up to meet us, and said<br>unto us, Go, turn again unto the<br>king that sent you, and say unto<br>him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not<br>because there is not a God in Israel,<br>that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-<br>zebub the god of Ekron? therefore<br>thou shalt not come down from that<br>bed on which thou art gone up, but<br>shalt surely die.<br>7 And he said unto them, What<br>manner of man was he which came<br>up to meet you, and told you these<br>words?<br>8 And they answered him, He was<br>an a hairy man, and girt with a gir-<br>dle of leather about his loins. And<br>he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.<br>9 Then the king sent unto him a<br>captain of fifty with his fifty. And<br>he went up to him: and, behold, he<br>sat on the top of an hill. And he<br>spake unto him, Thou man of God,<br>the king hath said, Come down.|Col4|

|10 And Elijah answered and said<br>to the captain of fifty, If I be a man<br>of God, then let a fire come down<br>from heaven, and consume thee and<br>thy fifty. And there came down fire<br>from heaven, and consumed him<br>and his fifty.<br>11 Again also he sent unto him<br>another captain of fifty with his<br>fifty. And he answered and said<br>unto him, O man of God, thus hath<br>the king said, Come down quickly.<br>12 And Elijah answered and said<br>unto them, If I be a man of God, let<br>fire come down from heaven, and<br>consume thee and thy fifty. And the<br>fire of God came down from heaven,<br>and consumed him and his fifty.<br>13 ¶ And he sent again a captain<br>of the third fifty with his fifty. And<br>the third captain of fifty went up,<br>and came and fell on his knees<br>before Elijah, and besought him,<br>and said unto him, O man of God,<br>I pray thee, let my life, and the life<br>of these fifty thy servants, be pre-<br>cious in thy sight.<br>14 Behold, there came fire down<br>from heaven, and burnt up the two<br>captains of the former fifties with<br>their fifties: therefore let my life<br>now be precious in thy sight.<br>15 And the a angel of the LORD said<br>unto Elijah, Go down with him: be<br>not afraid of him. And he arose, and<br>went down with him unto the king.<br>16 And he said unto him, Thus<br>saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou<br>hast sent messengers to inquire of<br>Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it<br>not because there is no God in Israel<br>to inquire of his word? therefore<br>thou shalt not come down off that<br>bed on which thou art gone up, but<br>shalt surely die.<br>17 ¶ So he a died according to the<br>word of the LORD which Elijah<br>had spoken. And bJ ehoram reigned<br>in his stead in the second year of|Col2|Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat<br>king of Judah; because he had no son.<br>18 Now the rest of the acts of<br>Ahaziah which he did, are they not<br>written in the book of the chroni-<br>cles of the kings of Israel?<br>CHAPTER 2<br>Elisha and the prophets know that Elijah<br>is to be translated—Elijah divides the<br>waters of the Jordan and is taken up<br>into heaven in a whirlwind—The mantle<br>of Elijah falls on Elisha, who also di-<br>vides the waters of the Jordan—Elisha<br>heals the waters of Jericho—Youths are<br>torn by bears for mocking Elisha.<br>AND it came to pass, when the LORD<br>would take up Elijah into heaven<br>by a whirlwind, that Elijah went<br>with a Elisha from b Gilgal.<br>2 And a Elijah said unto Elisha,<br>Tarry here, I pray thee; for the<br>LORD hath sent me to b Beth-el. And<br>Elisha said unto him, As the LORD<br>liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will<br>not c leave thee. So they went down<br>to Beth-el.<br>3 And the a sons of the prophets<br>that were at Beth-el came forth to<br>Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest<br>thou that the LORD will take away<br>thy master from thy head to day ?<br>And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye<br>your peace.<br>4 And Elijah said unto him, Eli-<br>sha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the<br>LORD hath sent me to aJ ericho. And<br>he said, As the LORD liveth, and as<br>thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.<br>So they came to Jericho.<br>5 And the sons of the prophets<br>that were at Jericho came to Elisha,<br>and said unto him, Knowest thou<br>that the LORD will take away thy<br>master from thy head to day ? And<br>he answered, Yea, I know it; hold<br>ye your peace.<br>6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry,|Col4|

|I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath<br>sent me to Jordan. And he said, As<br>the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liv-<br>eth, I will not leave thee. And they<br>two went on.<br>7 And fifty men of the sons of the<br>prophets went, and stood to view afar<br>off: and they two stood by Jordan.<br>8 And Elijah took his a mantle,<br>and wrapped it together, and smote<br>the b waters, and they were divided<br>hither and thither, so that they two<br>went over on dry ground.<br>9 ¶ And it came to pass, when they<br>were gone over, that Elijah said unto<br>Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee,<br>before I be taken away from thee.<br>And Elisha said, I pray thee, let<br>a a double portion of thy spirit be<br>upon me.<br>10 And he said, Thou hast asked a<br>hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see<br>me when I am taken from thee, it<br>shall be so unto thee; but if not,<br>it shall not be so.<br>11 And it came to pass, as they still<br>went on, and talked, that, behold,<br>there appeared a a chariot of fire, and<br>horses of fire, and parted them both<br>asunder; and b Elijah went up by a<br>c whirlwind into heaven.<br>12 ¶ And Elisha saw it, and he<br>cried, My father, my father, the<br>chariot of Israel, and the horsemen<br>thereof. And he saw him no more:<br>and he took hold of his own clothes,<br>and rent them in two pieces.<br>13 He took up also the mantle<br>of Elijah that fell from him, and<br>went back, and stood by the bank<br>of Jordan;<br>14 And he took the mantle of Eli-<br>jah that fell from him, and smote<br>the waters, and said, Where is the<br>LORD God of Elijah? and when he<br>also had smitten the waters, they<br>a parted hither and thither: and Eli-<br>sha went over.|Col2|15 And when the sons of the proph-<br>ets which were to view at Jericho saw<br>him, they said, The spirit of a Elijah<br>doth b rest on Elisha. And they came<br>to meet him, and bowed themselves<br>to the ground before him.<br>16 ¶ And they said unto him, Be-<br>hold now, there be with thy ser-<br>vants fifty strong men; let them go,<br>we pray thee, and seek thy master:<br>lest peradventure the a Spirit of the<br>LORD hath taken him up, and cast<br>him upon some mountain, or into<br>some valley. And he said, Ye shall<br>not send.<br>17 And when they urged him till<br>he was ashamed, he said, Send.<br>They sent therefore fifty men; and<br>they sought three days, but found<br>him not.<br>18 And when they came again to<br>him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he<br>said unto them, Did I not say unto<br>you, Go not?<br>19 ¶ And the men of the city said<br>unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee,<br>the situation of this city is pleas-<br>ant, as my lord seeth: but the water<br>is naught, and the ground barren.<br>20 And he said, Bring me a new<br>a cruse, and put salt therein. And<br>they brought it to him.<br>21 And he went forth unto the<br>spring of the waters, and cast the<br>a salt in there, and said, Thus saith<br>the LORD, I have healed these b wa-<br>ters; there shall not be from thence<br>any more death or c barren land.<br>22 So the waters were healed unto<br>this day, according to the saying of<br>Elisha which he spake.<br>23 ¶ And he went up from thence<br>unto Beth-el: and as he was going<br>up by the way, there came forth<br>a little children out of the city, and<br>b mocked him, and said unto him,<br>Go up, thou c bald head; go up, thou<br>bald head.|Col4|

And there came<br>forth two she bears out of the wood,<br>and tare forty and two children of<br>them.<br>25 And he went from thence to<br>mount a Carmel, and from thence<br>he returned to Samaria.<br>CHAPTER 3<br>Jehoram of Israel and Jehoshaphat of<br>Judah join forces against Moab—Elisha<br>promises them water for their animals<br>and victory in the war—The Moabites<br>are defeated.<br>NOW aJ ehoram the son of Ahab be-<br>gan to reign over Israel in b Samaria<br>the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat<br>king of Judah, and reigned twelve<br>years.<br>2 And he wrought a evil in the<br>sight of the LORD; but not like his<br>b father, and like his mother: for he<br>put away the c image of d Baal that his<br>father had made.<br>3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto<br>the sins of a Jeroboam the son of<br>Nebat, which made Israel to sin;<br>he departed not therefrom.<br>4 ¶ And Mesha king of a Moab was<br>a sheepmaster, and b rendered unto<br>the king of Israel an hundred thou-<br>sand lambs, and an hundred thou-<br>sand rams, with the wool.<br>5 But it came to pass, when Ahab<br>was dead, that the king of a Moab<br>b rebelled against the king of Israel.<br>6 ¶ And king Jehoram went out of<br>Samaria the same time, and num-<br>bered all Israel.<br>7 And he went and sent to aJ ehosh-<br>aphat the king of Judah, saying, The<br>king of Moab hath rebelled against<br>me: wilt thou go with me against|Col2|Moab to battle? And he said, I will<br>go up: b I am as thou art, my people<br>as thy people, and my horses as<br>thy horses.<br>8 And he said, Which way shall we<br>go up? And he answered, The way<br>through the wilderness of Edom.<br>9 So the king of Israel went, and<br>the king of Judah, and the a king of<br>b Edom: and they c fetched a compass<br>of seven days’ journey: and there<br>was no water for the host, and for<br>the cattle that followed them.<br>10 And the king of Israel said, Alas!<br>that the LORD hath called these three<br>kings together, to deliver them into<br>the hand of Moab!<br>11 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there<br>not here a prophet of the LORD,<br>that we may inquire of the LORD by<br>him? And one of the king of Israel’s<br>servants answered and said, Here<br>is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which<br>poured water on the hands of<br>Elijah.<br>12 And Jehoshaphat said, The<br>word of the LORD is with him.

|28 Then she said, Did I desire a<br>son of my lord? did I not say, Do<br>not deceive me?<br>29 Then he said to Gehazi, a Gird<br>up thy loins, and take my staff in<br>thine hand, and go thy way: if thou<br>meet any man, b salute him not; and<br>if any salute thee, answer him not<br>again: and lay my c staff upon the<br>face of the child.<br>30 And the mother of the child<br>said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy<br>soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And<br>he arose, and followed her.<br>31 And Gehazi passed on before<br>them, and laid the staff upon the<br>face of the child; but there was nei-<br>ther voice, nor hearing. Wherefore<br>he went again to meet him, and<br>told him, saying, The child is not<br>a awaked.<br>32 And when Elisha was come<br>into the house, behold, the child<br>was dead, and laid upon his bed.<br>33 He went in therefore, and a shut<br>the door upon them twain, and<br>prayed unto the LORD.<br>34 And he went up, and lay upon<br>the child, and put his mouth upon<br>his mouth, and his eyes upon his<br>eyes, and his a hands upon his hands:<br>and he b stretched himself upon the<br>child; and the flesh of the child<br>waxed warm.<br>35 Then he returned, and walked<br>in the house to and fro; and went<br>up, and stretched himself upon him:<br>and the child sneezed seven times,<br>and the child a opened his eyes.<br>36 And he called Gehazi, and said,<br>Call this Shunammite.

And he departed,<br>and a took with him ten talents of<br>silver, and six thousand pieces of<br>gold, and ten changes of raiment.<br>6 And he brought the letter to the<br>king of Israel, saying, Now when<br>this letter is come unto thee, behold,<br>I have therewith sent Naaman my<br>servant to thee, that thou mayest<br>recover him of his leprosy.<br>7 And it came to pass, when the<br>king of Israel had read the letter,<br>that he rent his clothes, and said,<br>Am I a God, to kill and to make alive,<br>that this man doth send unto me to<br>recover a man of his leprosy ? where-<br>fore consider, I pray you, and see how<br>he b seeketh a quarrel against me.<br>8 ¶ And it was so, when Elisha the<br>man of God had heard that the king<br>of Israel had rent his clothes, that he<br>sent to the king, saying, Wherefore<br>hast thou rent thy clothes? let him<br>come now to me, and he shall know<br>that there is a a prophet in Israel.<br>9 So Naaman came with his horses<br>and with his chariot, and stood at<br>the door of the house of Elisha.|Col2|10 And Elisha sent a messenger<br>unto him, saying, Go and a wash in<br>Jordan seven times, and thy flesh<br>shall come again to thee, and thou<br>shalt be b clean.<br>11 But Naaman was wroth, and went<br>away, and said, Behold, I thought,<br>He will surely come out to me, and<br>stand, and call on the name of the<br>LORD his God, and strike his hand<br>over the place, and recover the leper.<br>12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, riv-<br>ers of Damascus, better than all the<br>waters of Israel? may I not wash in<br>them, and be clean?

So he departed from him a<br>little way.<br>20 ¶ But Gehazi, the servant of Eli-<br>sha the man of God, said, Behold,<br>my master hath spared Naaman<br>this Syrian, in not receiving at his<br>hands that which he brought: but,<br>as the LORD liveth, I will run after<br>him, and take somewhat of him.<br>21 So Gehazi followed after Naa-<br>man. And when Naaman saw him<br>running after him, he lighted down<br>from the chariot to meet him, and<br>said, Is all well?<br>22 And he said, All is well. My mas-<br>ter hath sent me, saying, Behold,<br>even now there be come to me from<br>mount Ephraim two young men of<br>the sons of the prophets: give them,<br>I pray thee, a talent of silver, and<br>two changes of garments.<br>23 And Naaman said, Be content,<br>take two talents. And he urged him,<br>and bound two talents of silver in<br>two bags, with two changes of gar-<br>ments, and laid them upon two of<br>his servants; and they bare them<br>before him.<br>24 And when he came to the tower,<br>he took them from their hand, and<br>bestowed them in the house: and he<br>let the men go, and they departed.<br>25 But he went in, and stood before<br>his master. And Elisha said unto<br>him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi?<br>And he said, Thy servant went no<br>whither.<br>26 And he said unto him, Went<br>not mine heart with thee, when the<br>man turned again from his chariot<br>to meet thee? Is it a time to receive<br>money, and to receive garments,<br>and oliveyards, and vineyards, and<br>sheep, and oxen, and menservants,<br>and maidservants?|Col2|27 The a leprosy therefore of Naa-<br>man shall cleave unto thee, and unto<br>thy seed for ever.

And he<br>answered, Go ye.<br>3 And one said, Be content, I pray<br>thee, and go with thy servants. And<br>he answered, I will go.<br>4 So he went with them. And when<br>they came to Jordan, they cut down<br>wood.<br>5 But as one was felling a beam,<br>the axe head fell into the water: and<br>he cried, and said, Alas, master! for<br>it was a borrowed.<br>6 And the man of God said, Where<br>fell it?

|11 Therefore the heart of the king<br>of Syria was sore troubled for this<br>thing; and he called his servants,<br>and said unto them, Will ye not<br>shew me which of us is for the king<br>of Israel?<br>12 And one of his servants said,<br>None, my lord, O king: but Elisha,<br>the prophet that is in Israel, telleth<br>the king of Israel the words that<br>thou speakest in thy bedchamber.<br>13 ¶ And he said, Go and spy where<br>he is, that I may send and fetch<br>him. And it was told him, saying,<br>Behold, he is in Dothan.<br>14 Therefore sent he thither horses,<br>and chariots, and a great host: and<br>they came by night, and compassed<br>the city about.<br>15 And when the servant of the<br>man of God was risen early, and<br>gone forth, behold, an host com-<br>passed the city both with horses<br>and chariots. And his servant said<br>unto him, Alas, my master! how<br>shall we do?<br>16 And he answered, Fear not:<br>for they that be with us are more<br>than they that be with them.<br>17 And Elisha prayed, and said,<br>LORD, I pray thee, open his a eyes,<br>that he may see. And the LORD<br>opened the eyes of the young man;<br>and he saw: and, behold, the moun-<br>tain was full of horses and b chariots<br>of fire round about Elisha.<br>18 And when they came down to<br>him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,<br>and said, Smite this people, I pray<br>thee, with a blindness. And he smote<br>them with blindness according to<br>the word of Elisha.<br>19 ¶ And Elisha said unto them,<br>This is not the way, neither is this<br>the city: follow me, and I will bring<br>you to the man whom ye seek. But<br>he led them to Samaria.<br>20 And it came to pass, when they<br>were come into Samaria, that Eli-<br>sha said, LORD, open the eyes of<br>these men, that they may see. And<br>the LORD a opened their eyes, and|Col2|they saw; and, behold, they were in<br>the midst of Samaria.<br>21 And the king of Israel said<br>unto Elisha, when he saw them,<br>My father, shall I smite them? shall<br>I smite them?<br>22 And he answered, Thou shalt<br>not smite them: wouldest thou a smite<br>those whom thou hast taken captive<br>with thy sword and with thy bow?<br>set bread and water before them,<br>that they may eat and drink, and<br>go to their master.<br>23 And he prepared great provision<br>for them: and when they had eaten<br>and drunk, he sent them away, and<br>they went to their master. So the<br>bands of Syria came no more into<br>the land of Israel.<br>24 ¶ And it came to pass after this,<br>that a Ben-hadad king of Syria gath-<br>ered all his host, and went up, and<br>besieged Samaria.<br>25 And there was a great famine in<br>Samaria: and, behold, they besieged<br>it, until an ass’s head was sold for<br>fourscore pieces of silver, and the<br>fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung<br>for five pieces of silver.<br>26 And as the king of Israel was<br>passing by upon the wall, there<br>cried a woman unto him, saying,<br>Help, my lord, O king.<br>27 And he said, If the LORD do<br>not help thee, whence shall I help<br>thee? out of the barnfloor, or out<br>of the winepress?<br>28 And the king said unto her,<br>What aileth thee? And she an-<br>swered, This woman said unto me,<br>Give thy son, that we may eat him<br>to day, and we will eat my son to<br>morrow.<br>29 So we boiled my son, and did<br>a eat him: and I said unto her on<br>the next day, Give thy son, that<br>we may eat him: and she hath hid<br>her son.<br>30 ¶ And it came to pass, when the<br>king heard the words of the woman,<br>that he a rent his clothes; and he<br>passed by upon the wall, and the|Col4|

And he said,<br>Behold, thou shalt see it with thine<br>eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.<br>3 ¶ And there were four leprous<br>men at the entering in of the gate:<br>and they said one to another, Why<br>sit we here until we die?<br>4 If we say, We will enter into the<br>city, then the famine is in the city,<br>and we shall die there: and if we sit<br>still here, we die also.

|9 So Hazael went to meet him,<br>and took a present with him, even<br>of every good thing of Damascus,<br>forty camels’ burden, and came and<br>stood before him, and said, Thy son<br>Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent<br>me to thee, saying, Shall I recover<br>of this disease?<br>10 And Elisha said unto him, Go,<br>say unto him, Thou mayest certainly<br>recover: howbeit the LORD hath<br>shewed me that he shall surely die.<br>11 And he settled his countenance<br>steadfastly, until he was ashamed:<br>and the man of God wept.<br>12 And a Hazael said, Why weepeth<br>my lord? And he answered, Because<br>I know the evil that thou wilt do<br>unto the children of Israel: their<br>strong holds wilt thou set on fire,<br>and their young men wilt thou slay<br>with the sword, and wilt dash their<br>children, and rip up their women<br>with child.<br>13 And Hazael said, But what, is<br>thy servant a dog, that he should<br>do this great thing? And Elisha an-<br>swered, The LORD hath shewed me<br>that thou shalt be a king over Syria.<br>14 So he departed from Elisha,<br>and came to his master; who said<br>to him, What said Elisha to thee?<br>And he answered, He told me that<br>thou shouldest surely recover.<br>15 And it came to pass on the mor-<br>row, that he took a thick cloth, and<br>dipped it in water, and spread it on<br>his face, so that he died: and Hazael<br>reigned in his stead.<br>16 ¶ And in the fifth year of Joram<br>the son of Ahab king of Israel, Je-<br>hoshaphat being then king of Judah,<br>Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat<br>king of Judah began to reign.<br>17 Thirty and two years old was<br>he when he began to reign; and he<br>reigned eight years in Jerusalem.<br>18 And he walked in the way of<br>the kings of Israel, as did the house<br>of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab<br>was his wife: and he did evil in the<br>sight of the LORD.|Col2|19 Yet the LORD would not a destroy<br>Judah for b David his servant’s sake,<br>as he promised him to give him<br>alway a light, and to his children.<br>20 ¶ In his days Edom a revolted<br>from under the b hand of Judah,<br>and made a king over themselves.<br>21 So Joram went over to Zair, and<br>all the chariots with him: and he<br>rose by night, and smote the Edom-<br>ites which compassed him about,<br>and the captains of the chariots:<br>and the people fled into their tents.<br>22 Yet Edom revolted from un-<br>der the hand of Judah unto this<br>day.

|CHAPTER 9<br>A prophet anoints Jehu king over Israel<br>and prophesies the destruction of the<br>house of Ahab and the death of Jeze-<br>bel—Jehu kills Joram in the field of<br>Naboth—Jezebel is killed by Jehu and<br>is eaten by dogs.<br>AND Elisha the prophet called one<br>of the children of the prophets, and<br>said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and<br>take this box of oil in thine hand,<br>and go to Ramoth-gilead:<br>2 And when thou comest thither,<br>look out there Jehu the son of Je-<br>hoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and<br>go in, and make him arise up from<br>among his brethren, and carry him<br>to an inner chamber;<br>3 Then take the box of oil, and<br>pour it on his head, and say, Thus<br>saith the LORD, I have anointed<br>thee king over Israel. Then open<br>the door, and flee, and tarry not.<br>4 ¶ So the young man, even the<br>young man the prophet, went to<br>Ramoth-gilead.<br>5 And when he came, behold, the<br>captains of the host were sitting; and<br>he said, I have an errand to thee, O<br>captain. And Jehu said, Unto which<br>of all us? And he said, To thee, O<br>captain.<br>6 And he arose, and went into the<br>house; and he poured the a oil on<br>his head, and said unto him, Thus<br>saith the LORD God of Israel, I have<br>anointed thee king over the people<br>of the LORD, even over Israel.<br>7 And thou shalt a smite the house<br>of Ahab thy master, that I may<br>avenge the blood of my servants the<br>prophets, and the blood of all the<br>servants of the LORD, at the hand<br>of bJ ezebel.<br>8 For the whole house of aA hab<br>shall perish: and I will cut off from<br>Ahab him that pisseth against the<br>wall, and him that is shut up and<br>left in Israel:<br>9 And I will make the house of<br>Ahab like the house of aJ eroboam|Col2|the son of Nebat, and like the house<br>of b Baasha the son of Ahijah:<br>10 And the a dogs shall eat Jezebel<br>in the portion of Jezreel, and there<br>shall be none to bury her. And he<br>opened the door, and fled.<br>11 ¶ Then Jehu came forth to the<br>servants of his lord: and one said<br>unto him, Is all well? wherefore<br>came this mad fellow to thee? And<br>he said unto them, Ye know the<br>man, and his communication.<br>12 And they said, It is false; tell us<br>now. And he said, Thus and thus<br>spake he to me, saying, Thus saith<br>the LORD, I have anointed thee king<br>over Israel.<br>13 Then they hasted, and took<br>every man his garment, and put it<br>under him on the top of the stairs,<br>and blew with trumpets, saying,<br>Jehu is king.<br>14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat<br>the son of Nimshi conspired against<br>Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ra-<br>moth-gilead, he and all Israel, be-<br>cause of Hazael king of Syria.<br>15 But king Joram was returned to<br>be healed in Jezreel of the wounds<br>which the Syrians had given him,<br>when he fought with Hazael king of<br>Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your<br>minds, then let none go forth nor<br>escape out of the city to go to tell<br>it in Jezreel.<br>16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and<br>went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.<br>And Ahaziah king of Judah was<br>come down to see Joram.<br>17 And there stood a watchman on<br>the tower in Jezreel, and he spied<br>the company of Jehu as he came,<br>and said, I see a company.

|The messenger came to them, but<br>he cometh not again.<br>19 Then he sent out a second on<br>horseback, which came to them, and<br>said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace?<br>And Jehu answered, What hast thou to<br>do with peace? turn thee behind me.<br>20 And the watchman told, say-<br>ing, He came even unto them, and<br>cometh not again: and the driving<br>is like the driving of Jehu the son<br>of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.<br>21 And Joram said, Make ready.<br>And his chariot was made ready.<br>And Joram king of Israel and Ahaz-<br>iah king of Judah went out, each<br>in his chariot, and they went out<br>against Jehu, and met him in the<br>portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.<br>22 And it came to pass, when Joram<br>saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace,<br>Jehu? And he answered, What peace,<br>so long as the whoredoms of thy<br>mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts<br>are so many ?<br>23 And Joram turned his hands,<br>and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There<br>is treachery, O Ahaziah.<br>24 And Jehu drew a bow with his<br>full strength, and a smote Jehoram<br>between his arms, and the arrow<br>went out at his heart, and he sunk<br>down in his chariot.<br>25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his<br>captain, Take up, and cast him in<br>the portion of the field of Naboth<br>the Jezreelite: for remember how<br>that, when I and thou rode together<br>after Ahab his father, the LORD laid<br>this burden upon him;<br>26 Surely I have seen yesterday the<br>blood of Naboth, and the blood of<br>his sons, saith the LORD; and I will<br>requite thee in this plat, saith the<br>LORD. Now therefore take and cast<br>him into the plat of ground, accord-<br>ing to the word of the LORD.<br>27 ¶ But when Ahaziah the king of<br>Judah saw this, he fled by the way<br>of the garden house. And Jehu fol-<br>lowed after him, and said, a Smite<br>him also in the chariot. And they did|Col2|so at the going up to Gur, which is<br>by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,<br>and died there.<br>28 And his servants carried him<br>in a chariot to Jerusalem, and bur-<br>ied him in his sepulchre with his<br>fathers in the city of David.<br>29 And in the eleventh year of Jo-<br>ram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah<br>to reign over Judah.<br>30 ¶ And when Jehu was come<br>to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and<br>she painted her face, and a tired her<br>head, and looked out at a window.<br>31 And as Jehu entered in at the<br>gate, she said, Had a Zimri peace,<br>who slew his master?<br>32 And he lifted up his face to the<br>window, and said, Who is on my<br>side? who? And there looked out<br>to him two or three eunuchs.<br>33 And he said, Throw her down.<br>So they a threw her down: and some<br>of her blood was sprinkled on the<br>wall, and on the horses: and he<br>trode her under foot.<br>34 And when he was come in, he<br>did eat and drink, and said, Go, see<br>now this cursed woman, and bury<br>her: for she is a king’s a daughter.<br>35 And they went to bury her: but<br>they found no more of her than the<br>skull, and the feet, and the palms<br>of her hands.<br>36 Wherefore they came again, and<br>told him.

|AND Ahab had seventy sons in Sa-<br>maria.

And<br>Athaliah did reign over the land.<br>4 ¶ And the seventh year Jehoiada<br>sent and fetched the rulers over<br>hundreds, with the captains and<br>the guard, and brought them to<br>him into the house of the LORD, and<br>made a a covenant with them, and<br>took an oath of them in the house<br>of the LORD, and shewed them the<br>king’s son.<br>5 And he commanded them, say-<br>ing, This is the thing that ye shall<br>do; A third part of you that enter in<br>on the a sabbath shall even be keep-<br>ers of the watch of the king’s house;<br>6 And a third part shall be at the<br>a gate of Sur; and a third part at the<br>gate behind the guard: so shall ye<br>keep the watch of the house, that<br>it be not broken down.<br>7 And two parts of all you that<br>go forth on the sabbath, even they<br>shall keep the watch of the house<br>of the LORD about the king.<br>8 And ye shall compass the king<br>round about, every man with his<br>weapons in his hand: and he that<br>cometh within the ranges, let him<br>be slain: and be ye with the king as<br>he goeth out and as he cometh in.<br>9 And the captains over the hun-<br>dreds did according to all things that<br>Jehoiada the priest commanded:<br>and they took every man his men<br>that were to come in on the sabbath,<br>with them that should go out on<br>the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada<br>the priest.|Col2|10 And to the captains over hun-<br>dreds did the priest give king Da-<br>vid’s spears and a shields, that were<br>in the temple of the LORD.<br>11 And the guard stood, every<br>man with his weapons in his hand,<br>round about the king, from the<br>right corner of the temple to the<br>left corner of the temple, along by<br>the altar and the temple.<br>12 And he brought forth the king’s<br>son, and put the crown upon him,<br>and gave him the a testimony; and<br>they made him king, and anointed<br>him; and they clapped their hands,<br>and said, b God save the king.<br>13 ¶ And when Athaliah heard<br>the noise of the guard and of the<br>people, she came to the people into<br>the temple of the LORD.<br>14 And when she looked, behold,<br>the king stood by a a pillar, as the<br>manner was, and the princes and the<br>trumpeters by the king, and all the<br>people of the land rejoiced, and blew<br>with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her<br>clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.<br>15 But Jehoiada the priest com-<br>manded the captains of the hun-<br>dreds, the officers of the host, and<br>said unto them, Have her forth<br>without the ranges: and him that<br>followeth her kill with the sword.<br>For the priest had said, Let her not<br>be slain in the house of the LORD.<br>16 And they laid hands on her; and<br>she went by the way by the which<br>the a horses came into the king’s<br>house: and there was she slain.<br>17 ¶ And Jehoiada made a cov-<br>enant between the LORD and the<br>king and the people, that they<br>should be the LORD’s people; be-<br>tween the king also and the people.<br>18 And all the people of the land<br>went into the house of Baal, and<br>brake it down; his altars and his<br>images brake they in pieces thor-<br>oughly, and slew Mattan the priest<br>of Baal before the altars.

|19 And he took the rulers over<br>hundreds, and the captains, and<br>the guard, and all the people of the<br>land; and they brought down the<br>king from the house of the LORD,<br>and came by the way of the gate of<br>the guard to the king’s house. And<br>he sat on the throne of the kings.<br>20 And all the people of the land<br>rejoiced, and the city was in quiet:<br>and they slew Athaliah with the<br>sword beside the king’s house.<br>21 Seven years old was Jehoash<br>when he began to reign.<br>CHAPTER 12<br>Jehoash (Joash) reigns in righteous-<br>ness—The breaches in the temple are<br>repaired—The safety of Jerusalem is<br>purchased with the hallowed things in<br>the temple—Joash is slain and Ama-<br>ziah reigns.<br>IN the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash<br>began to reign; and forty years<br>reigned he in Jerusalem. And his<br>mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-<br>sheba.<br>2 And Jehoash did that which was<br>right in the sight of the LORD all his<br>days wherein Jehoiada the priest<br>instructed him.<br>3 But the a high places were not<br>taken away: the people still sac-<br>rificed and burnt incense in the<br>high places.<br>4 ¶ And Jehoash said to the priests,<br>All the a money of the dedicated<br>things that is brought into the house<br>of the LORD, even the money of ev-<br>ery one that passeth the account, the<br>money that every man is set at, and<br>all the money that cometh into any<br>man’s heart to bring into the house<br>of the LORD,<br>5 Let the priests take it to them,<br>every man of his acquaintance:<br>and let them repair the breaches of<br>the house, wheresoever any breach<br>shall be found.<br>6 But it was so, that in the three<br>and twentieth year of king Jehoash|Col2|the priests had not repaired the<br>a breaches of the house.<br>7 Then king Jehoash called for<br>Jehoiada the priest, and the other<br>priests, and said unto them, Why<br>repair ye not the breaches of the<br>house? now therefore receive no<br>more money of your acquaintance,<br>but deliver it for the breaches of<br>the house.<br>8 And the priests consented to<br>receive no more money of the peo-<br>ple, neither to repair the breaches<br>of the house.<br>9 But Jehoiada the priest took a<br>chest, and bored a hole in the lid of<br>it, and set it beside the altar, on the<br>right side as one cometh into the<br>house of the LORD: and the priests<br>that kept the door put therein all<br>the money that was brought into<br>the house of the LORD.<br>10 And it was so, when they saw<br>that there was much money in the<br>chest, that the king’s scribe and the<br>high priest came up, and they put<br>up in bags, and told the a money that<br>was found in the house of the LORD.<br>11 And they gave the money, being<br>told, into the hands of them that did<br>the work, that had the oversight of<br>the house of the LORD: and they laid<br>it out to the carpenters and build-<br>ers, that wrought upon the house<br>of the LORD,<br>12 And to masons, and hewers<br>of stone, and to buy timber and<br>hewed stone to repair the breaches<br>of the house of the LORD, and for all<br>that was laid out for the house to<br>repair it.<br>13 Howbeit there were not made<br>for the house of the LORD a bowls<br>of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets,<br>any vessels of gold, or vessels of sil-<br>ver, of the money that was brought<br>into the house of the LORD:<br>14 But they gave that to the work-<br>men, and repaired therewith the<br>house of the LORD.<br>15 Moreover they a reckoned not<br>with the men, into whose hand they|Col4|

And<br>Joash the king of Israel came down<br>unto him, and wept over his face,<br>and said, O my father, my father,<br>the chariot of Israel, and the horse-<br>men thereof.<br>15 And Elisha said unto him, Take<br>bow and arrows. And he took unto<br>him bow and arrows.<br>16 And he said to the king of Is-<br>rael, Put thine hand upon the bow.<br>And he put his hand upon it: and<br>Elisha put his hands upon the king’s<br>hands.<br>17 And he said, Open the win-<br>dow eastward. And he opened it.<br>Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he<br>shot. And he said, The arrow of the<br>LORD’s deliverance, and the arrow<br>of deliverance from Syria: for thou<br>shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek,<br>till thou have consumed them.<br>18 And he said, Take the arrows.<br>And he took them.

And Hezekiah<br>wept sore.<br>4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah<br>was gone out into the middle court,<br>that the word of the LORD came to<br>him, saying,<br>5 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the<br>captain of my people, Thus saith the<br>LORD, the God of David thy father, I<br>have heard thy prayer, I have seen<br>thy tears: behold, I will a heal thee:<br>on the third day thou shalt go up<br>unto the house of the LORD.<br>6 And I will add unto thy a days<br>fifteen years; and I will deliver thee<br>and this city out of the hand of the<br>king of Assyria; and I will defend<br>this city for mine own sake, and for<br>my servant David’s sake.<br>7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of<br>figs. And they took and laid it on<br>the boil, and he recovered.<br>8 ¶ And Hezekiah said unto Isa-<br>iah, What shall be the a sign that the<br>LORD will heal me, and that I shall<br>go up into the house of the LORD<br>the third day ?<br>9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt<br>thou have of the LORD, that the LORD<br>will do the thing that he hath spo-<br>ken: shall the a shadow go forward<br>ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?<br>10 And Hezekiah answered, It is<br>a light thing for the a shadow to<br>go down ten degrees: nay, but let<br>the shadow return backward ten<br>degrees.<br>11 And Isaiah the prophet cried<br>unto the LORD: and he brought the<br>shadow ten degrees a backward, by<br>which it had gone down in the dial<br>of Ahaz.<br>12 ¶ At that time a Berodach-<br>baladan, the son of Baladan, king of<br>Babylon, sent letters and a present|Col2|unto Hezekiah: for he had heard<br>that Hezekiah had been sick.<br>13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto<br>them, and shewed them all the house<br>of his precious things, the silver,<br>and the gold, and the spices, and<br>the precious ointment, and all the<br>house of his armour, and all that<br>was found in his a treasures: there<br>was nothing in his house, nor in<br>all his dominion, that Hezekiah<br>shewed them not.<br>14 ¶ Then came Isaiah the prophet<br>unto king Hezekiah, and said unto<br>him, What said these men? and<br>from whence came they unto thee?<br>And Hezekiah said, They are come<br>from a far country, even from<br>Babylon.<br>15 And he said, What have they<br>seen in thine house?
