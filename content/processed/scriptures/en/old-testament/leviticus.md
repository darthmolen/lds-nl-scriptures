|CHAPTER 1<br>Animals without blemish are sacrificed<br>as an atonement for sins—Burnt offer-<br>ings are a sweet savor unto the Lord.<br>A<br>ND the LORD a called unto b Mo-<br>ses, and spake unto him out<br>of the c tabernacle of the con-<br>gregation, saying,<br>2 Speak unto the children of Is-<br>rael, and say unto them, If any man<br>of you bring an offering unto the<br>LORD, ye shall bring your offering<br>of the cattle, even of the herd, and<br>of the flock.<br>3 If his offering be a a burnt b sac-<br>rifice of the herd, let him offer a<br>male c without d blemish: he shall<br>offer it of his own e voluntary will<br>at the door of the tabernacle of the<br>congregation before the LORD.<br>4 And he shall put his a hand upon<br>the head of the burnt offering; and<br>it shall be b accepted for him to make<br>c atonement for him.<br>5 And he shall kill the a bullock<br>before the LORD: and the priests,<br>Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood,<br>and b sprinkle the blood round<br>about upon the altar that is by the<br>door of the tabernacle of the con-<br>gregation.<br>6 And he shall flay the burnt off-<br>ering, and cut it into his pieces.<br>7 And the sons of aA aron the priest<br>shall put fire upon the altar, and|Col2|lay the wood in b order upon the<br>fire:<br>8 And the priests, Aaron’s sons,<br>shall lay the parts, the head, and the<br>fat, in order upon the wood that is<br>on the fire which is upon the altar:<br>9 But his inwards and his legs<br>shall he wash in water: and the<br>a priest shall burn all on the altar,<br>to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering<br>made by fire, of a b sweet savour<br>unto the LORD.<br>10 ¶ And if his offering be of the<br>flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the<br>goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall<br>bring it a male a without blemish.<br>11 And he shall kill it on the side<br>of the altar northward before the<br>LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons,<br>shall sprinkle his blood round about<br>upon the altar.<br>12 And he shall cut it into his<br>pieces, with his head and his fat:<br>and the priest shall lay them in or-<br>der on the wood that is on the fire<br>which is upon the altar:<br>13 But he shall wash the inwards<br>and the legs with water: and the<br>priest shall bring it all, and burn it<br>upon the altar: it is a a burnt sacri-<br>fice, an offering made by fire, of a<br>sweet savour unto the LORD.<br>14 ¶ And if the burnt sacrifice for<br>his offering to the LORD be of fowls,<br>then he shall bring his offering of<br>a turtledoves, or of young pigeons.|Col4|
