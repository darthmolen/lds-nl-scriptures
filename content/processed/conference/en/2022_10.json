It wasn’t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted asignbetween me and my Heavenly Father. With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don’ts.

King Benjamin, in his final address, admonished the people, “Hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; … open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.”General conference is a similar setting. We come to hear counsel for “this day,” that we may be “true at all times”to the Lord and His gospel. Pressing upon me “this day” is the importance of renewing our commitment to the Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith called “the most correct of any book on earth.”",

He was the former president of the British Mission, and two of his missionaries are on the stand this day: my dear Brethren Elder Jeffrey R. Holland and Elder Quentin L. Cook.Just as with his missionaries in England, he challenged us to read an unmarked copy of the Book of Mormon at least two times. I took up the task. The first reading I was to mark or underline everything that pointed to or testified of Jesus Christ. I used a red pencil, and I underlined many passages. The second time, Elder Hanks said to highlight principles and doctrine of the gospel, and this time I used blue to mark the scriptures. I read the Book of Mormon twice, as suggested, and then two more times, using yellow and black to mark passages that stood out to me.As you can see, I made many notations.",

A successful donor transplant causes a very real physiological change. Amazingly, a doctor explained that if Aaron committed a crime and left blood at the crime scene, the police could arrest his brother Maxwell. This is because Aaron’s blood would come from Maxwell’s transplanted cells and have Maxwell’s DNA, and this would be the case for the rest of his life.",

He said, “Behold, he changed their hearts.”They “humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God … [and] were faithful until the end … [and] were saved.”The people were willing to open their hearts and exercise faith, and then the Lord changed their hearts.

The Bible Dictionary adds that “the wordgospelmeans ‘good news.’ The good news is that Jesus Christ has made a perfect atonement for mankind that will redeem all mankind. … The records of His mortal life and the events pertaining to His ministry are called the Gospels” (Bible Dictionary, “Gospels”). 3 Nephi, recorded by Nephi, the grandson of Helaman, contains a record of the appearance and teaching of the resurrected Jesus Christ in the Americas just after His Crucifixion and therefore may also be referred to as a “Gospel.” The Gospels are particularly compelling because they record events and circumstances in which Jesus Himself actively teaches and participates. They are a critical starting point for understanding Jesus as the Christ, our relationship to Him, and His gospel.",

Do as he did. Live as he lived, so far as we can. He was the perfect man” (Behold the Lamb of God[1962], 8, 11).

The door was never shut unless someone deliberately wished for privacy; an open door meant an open invitation for all to come in. In the humbler [homes] such as [the one identified inMark 2] must have been, there was no entrance hall; the door opened directly … to the street. So, in no time, a crowd had filled the house to capacity and jammed the pavement round the door; and they were all eagerly listening to what Jesus had to say.”",

Well, like older brothers sometimes do, they decided to pull a prank. They removed the rest of her belongings from the closet and off the walls, leaving the room bare. Then they wrote a note and tacked it to the wall: “Dear Emily, we moved. We’ll write in a few days and tell you where we are. Love, your family.”",

We do our very best to protect our daily experiences so the influence of the Holy Ghost remains with us. We are a light to the world, and when necessary, we willingly choose to be different from others. President Dallin H.

We judge less and forgive more. Trusting His merits, mercy, and gracecan free us from contention, anger, abuse, abandonment, unfairness, and the physical and mental challenges that sometimes come with a physical body in a mortal world. Happy and forever do not mean that every relationship will be happy and forever. But a thousand millennial years when Satan is boundmay give us needed time and surprising ways to love, understand, and work things out as we prepare for eternity.",

The king at first was graciously considerate, inquiring only as to how the man had entered without a wedding garment. Had the guest been able to explain his exceptional appearance, or had he any reasonable excuse to offer, he surely would have spoken; but we are told that he remained speechless. The king’s summons had been freely extended to all whom his servants had found; but each of them had to enter the royal palace by the door; and before reaching the banquet room, in which the king would appear in person, each would be properly attired; but the deficient one, by some means had entered by another way; and not having passed the attendant sentinels at the portal, he was an intruder.”",

It has been said that “a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.”Have you ever had the experience of calling someone by the wrong name or forgetting their name? My wife, Alexis, and I have, on occasion, called one of our children “Lola.” Unfortunately, as you may have guessed, Lola is our dog! For better or worse, forgetting someone’s name communicates to that person that you probably don’t know them very well.",

Our love for Him, our desire to draw closer to Him and to abide in His love,will motivate us to try the virtue of the word in our lives—both the virtue that flows from Him as our personal Savior and Redeemerand the virtue that flows from Him through the words of “the chosen vessels of the Lord.”We will come to discern that, as helpful as other sources may be in our study of the Savior and the words of His prophets, they must never become a replacement for them. We must drink deeply and oftendirectly from the source.",

Everything changed at that moment. The Spirit in the room was undeniable. It seemed everyone was touched. “The Comforter … beareth record of the Father and of the Son.”I am so grateful I summoned the courage to bear my testimony.",
